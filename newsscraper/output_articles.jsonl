(KKTV) - Two Colorado Springs residents have been charged after a 15-year-old girl died from a fentanyl intoxication, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nOn June 7, officials said court documents outlined that Colorado Springs Police and emergency medical services responded to a report of a responsive female. Upon arrival, they say the 15-year-old girl was found dead.\n\nUpon arrival, officials said investigators found nine blue pills with \u201cM\u201d and \u201c30\u2033 on them wrapped in a receipt that was linked to 57-year-old Eugene Edwards.\n\nOfficials said a search of the victim\u2019s phone revealed that she had planned to meet with Edwards to buy the pills at a Colorado Springs elementary school the night before she died.\n\nSurveillance footage and a license plate reader confirmed that Edwards\u2019 car was near the same elementary school, and officials said an hour later, video showed the victim outside of her home smoking what appeared to be the fentanyl. They say she died shortly after.\n\nEdwards, who had several felony convictions for robbery, burglary and drug offences, was arrested on June 13 after suspected fentanyl and meth were found in his vehicle, officials said. They shared that 10 pills found in his vehicle were wrapped in a receipt.\n\nDuring an interview, officials said Edwards admitted that he got the pills from a woman identified as 30-year-old Destiny Benjamin.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, cell phone records and texts between Edwards and Benjamin detailed that their relationship was based on supplying drugs for money, including meth and fentanyl. Edwards reportedly shared that his only current supply of fentanyl pills came from Benjamin.\n\nOfficials say Benjamin was also arrested on June 13, and fentanyl, meth and a loaded handgun were found at the time of her arrest. They said Benjamin admitted to investigators that she had provided drugs to Edwards.\n\nAccording to officials, conspiracy to distribute fentanyl resulting in death carries a possible penalty of 20 years to life in prison, a fine of no more than $1 million and no less than three years of supervised release.\n\nCopyright 2025 KKTV.

She bounced around to a few places but eventually returned home to Colorado Springs, where she overdosed on heroin in a hotel room.\n\nA family member called child welfare, which removed Miller\u2019s twins from her care.\n\n\u201cWhen they came and took my kids, I really didn\u2019t feel anything. I was high,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd to be honest with you, I needed help. I needed something.\n\n\u201cI was living in a hotel. We were doing drugs. That\u2019s not where I was supposed to be. That\u2019s not what I wanted. That\u2019s not what I deserved.\u201d\n\nWhen Miller\u2019s children were removed from her care, she reconnected with Aspen Miracle Center in Westminster, Colo., where she had received treatment during her pregnancy. Aspen readmitted her into its program.\n\nAspen Miracle Center is an inpatient treatment facility in Westminster for Medicaid patients with around-the-clock staffing. Miller could guarantee to her El Paso County Child Protective Services social worker that a staff member would always be present to watch over her twins. She was reunited with them five days after they were removed from her care. At Aspen Miracle Center, with her twins present, she detoxed and started working toward sobriety once again.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t stopped since,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working just as hard\u2014as soon as I woke up from withdrawal or recovering from being up for however many days\u2014I\u2019ve just been working ever since.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s story contrasts with those of many pregnant and postpartum people in Colorado and nationwide. In Colorado, from 2016 to 2020, the second leading cause of death for pregnant and postpartum people was accidental overdose, according to a July 2023 report from the Colorado Maternal Mortality Review Committee. (The leading cause of death for this demographic during the same period was suicide.) There were 174 pregnancy-associated deaths during the four years, making Colorado\u2019s pregnancy-associated mortality ratio 54.7 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\nNationally, the maternal mortality rate has been steadily increasing. In 2021, the rate was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\nBecause of different methodologies, it is difficult to compare the state and national rates. The maternal mortality rate in Colorado is calculated over a period that includes pregnancy and the first year after giving birth. Colorado\u2019s data also include deaths that are both pregnancy-associated as well as pregnancy-related, which means all deaths that occur during pregnancy or within one year of the end of pregnancy are included.\n\nBy contrast, the National Center for Health Statistics only looks at deaths during pregnancy and through six weeks postpartum. It does not include deaths \u201cfrom accidental or incidental causes,\u201d which excludes deaths from causes such as accidental overdose.\n\nMaternal mortality is often considered a metric of the overall health of a community. While state and national rates cannot be easily compared, one thing is clear: the rate of maternal mortality is increasing nationwide, putting birthing people at a higher risk of death.\n\nIn Colorado and the rest of the country, people of color, people living in poverty or rural areas, those with less than a high school education or people who are older than 40 are disproportionately impacted by maternal mortality. Addressing the high mortality rates among these populations is an essential step toward achieving health equity, according to the Maternal Mortality Review Committee report.\n\nOver the last decade, in particular, Colorado hospitals, lawmakers and community organizations have worked to address the increasing maternal mortality rate due to mental and behavioral health issues, including overdose. These changes have had a positive impact, but those same changemakers point to many improvements that still need to be made.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, maternal mortality dropped rapidly across the world. The introduction of improved maternity services, safer surgical procedures and antibiotics, to name a few factors, led to better outcomes for pregnant and postpartum people.\n\nIn 1933, the ratio of deaths to live births in the U.S. was 619 per 100,000, according to The Commonwealth Fund. The number decreased through the 1960s to 37 per 100,000, then even more to about nine deaths per 100,000 in the 1990s.\n\nThen, in 1997, the trend started to move in the opposite direction in the U.S. By 2017, maternal mortality was continuing to decline worldwide except in two countries: the U.S. and the Dominican Republic, according to the World Health Organization. The 2021 ratio of deaths to live births in this country is nearing the ratio last seen more than 60 years ago.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2016, the leading causes of death for pregnant and postpartum people included infection, severe bleeding and heart conditions. In 2016, that all started to change: two of the leading causes of death are now related to mental or behavioral health, including suicide and accidental overdose related to a substance use disorder.\n\n\u201cAs an obstetric provider, it was shocking to me that it\u2019s actually behavioral health care issues like substance use and anxiety and depression,\u201d said Amber Johnson, a certified nurse midwife and quality improvement coach at the Colorado Perinatal Care Quality Collaborative. \u201cFor me, and I think for many clinicians, that\u2019s kind of a pivotal point of us just realizing that it\u2019s not the things that we were classically trained in as obstetric providers, like hemorrhage and hypertension and infection.\u201d\n\nTraining obstetric providers is one step toward creating better outcomes for birthing patients with substance use disorders. The Maternal Overdose Matters Plus program was launched in 10 birthing hospitals earlier this year. The program aids hospitals in providing equitable access to treatment and recovery for patients with substance use disorders, as well as offers birthing hospitals free naloxone, a life-saving overdose medication, to dispense to families where the pregnant person or someone else in the household is at risk of opioid overdose.\n\nThe initiative allows providers to start medication-assisted treatment (such as the use of buprenorphine or methadone to treat opioid use disorder) while pregnant patients are at the hospital for delivery or another reason. This moves away from the older model of providing patients with a list of self-guided resources and takes advantage of critical windows of care to get patients on a treatment plan.\n\nFor Miller, an earlier intervention might have changed the trajectory of her addiction well before she gave birth to her twins. She started using methamphetamine in 2009 when she was 22 years old. She was already the mother of two young boys\u2014the first she had when she was 16 and living in a group home, and the second when she was 19. Today, both boys live with their fathers.\n\nMiller\u2019s mom struggled with substance abuse when she was growing up. Her interest in trying meth for the first time was related to her mother\u2019s use of it.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to know more about it. I was so curious as to why my mom chose that over me,\u201d she said.\n\nMiller continued to raise her first two children while her meth use persisted.\n\n\u201cI still picked up my kids from school. I was part of the PTO. I would use it more like a tool,\u201d she said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that I also didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in the bathroom\u2014I spent a lot of time in the bathroom. My kids may have been neglected, not sure, but I was still there, and they were there.\u201d\n\nShe got married and pregnant again with her third son when she was 25. (The twins are her fourth and fifth sons.) She managed to stay sober during her pregnancy but relapsed soon after giving birth. Something flipped for her. She called it a quarter-life crisis.\n\n\u201cI started thinking, why did that happen with my parents? Why was I in the system? Why did my mom do drugs? Why was my dad violent?\u201d Miller wondered.\n\n\u201cI was shattered. I was a fractured person. Looking back now, I was probably coping with these things with the tools that I had at my disposal.\u201d\n\nShe left her partner when her third son was about eight months old.\n\n\u201cMy life spiraled. I was living with this boyfriend. I was running away from him all the time because he was controlling everybody around him with heroin. \u2026 I would always have to go back because he was a heroin drug dealer, so he always had it,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhen I got on heroin, that\u2019s when I had nothing.\u201d While using meth, she said, \u201cI was still scheduled, still had my kids\u2014but heroin, before I knew it, five years was gone. It was crazy.\u201d\n\nA stint in jail for possession and theft landed her in court-mandated treatment, which she said was necessary because she learned a lot and started to understand her addiction better. However, she had to leave the treatment center after attempting suicide; the center said it didn\u2019t have suitable mental health treatment options for her.\n\nShe managed to stay sober for more than a year. Then, she became pregnant with her twins. She relapsed after finding out, and about halfway through her pregnancy, she found Aspen Miracle Center.\n\nDuring the time Miller was using, then getting clean and then relapsing, overdose deaths in Colorado and the U.S. were steadily climbing. Between 2019 and 2021, overdose deaths increased by more than 70%, according to state and federal data, and Colorado\u2019s overdose deaths outpaced the national average.\n\nFor Miller, who now lives and works in Denver, where she has custody of her twins, the difference has been her time at the Aspen Miracle Center. She met people she could relate to and rely on and who understood what she was going through. She learned the skills she needed to choose her children over her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and other people in her life who use substances. Miller said she also started figuring out how to break the generational cycle she was born into.\n\n\u201cI grew up with my dad,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom was on substances. My children grew up with their dads, and I did substances. So I followed out that generational pattern, and I get to choose to do something different with my younger kids today.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org", "article_id": "812415b8-1cee-4595-ab38-2f0c45dec9a3", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Roberts and three other adults were taken into custody. The three children were turned over to Arapahoe County Department of Human Services.\n\nThat raid occurred two months after a woman was questioned by Denver officers after she left the home. Officers began conducting surveillance on the home after receiving tips from other drug case defendants. The woman arrived in an Uber, according to the affidavit. When she left, an unknown black man walked to curb and looked both ways along the street, presumably looking for any law enforcement vehicles following the Uber. The surveilling officers avoided detection and managed to pull over the Uber driver for not using a turn signal.

By 2023, there were 1,157 total opioid overdose deaths overall, and 117 deaths among non-Hispanic Black adults, the new report says.According to lead author Cole Jurecka, a researcher at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus , this report follows a longer examination of House Bill 22-1326 , but with more data and analysis.Introduced by former state legislators Alec Garnett, Brittany Pettersen, and John Cooke, HB 1326 had a contentious path through the General Assembly. After a law passed three years earlier making it a misdemeanor to possess up to four grams of most drugs, HB 1326 was billed as a correction to that law, according to supporters. Many Republican state lawmakers at the time thought the measure didn't go far enough in increasing criminal penalties for fentanyl, while some Democrats were concerned it would just ramp up the war on drugs.The new law's provisions outline harm reduction and substance abuse treatment, but also elevated possession of one to four grams of any drug containing fentanyl from a misdemeanor to a level-four drug felony. That definition is important, as drugs like cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine can also be tainted with fentanyl.There was also a provision in the law requiring the Behavioral Health Administration to hire an independent entity to study the public health effects of the newly increased criminal penalties, with Jurecka and his colleagues getting the call. The first report , released at the beginning of the year, found no reduction in overdose death rates associated with the law's enactment. It also noted that \"criminal penalties were perceived by participants as misguided in contrast to other approaches to stemming drug overdoses, including expanding access to medication, other treatment services, and criminal legal diversion options.\"The new report, with more data and more sources of data, concludes that the increased penalties did not change the preexisting trends for opioid overdose deaths in Colorado, and may have contributed to an increase in overdose deaths among the state's Black population.\"We cannot attribute any causal effect to the bill on fatal overdoses,\" Jurecka says. \"We can say: this bill, one of the stated goals is to reduce overdose deaths. It did not do that, but there are a bunch of contributing factors to understand why it didn't do that, outside of just the bill.\"Jos\u00e9 Esquibel is the director of the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention, based at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. The Consortium has existed since 2013, and has been primarily responsible for coordinating the statewide response to the opioid crisis. Esquibel says opioid overdose deaths across the country, including in Colorado, were down in 2024, but the crisis is still on the upswing.\"When you take the 2020 overdose death and you cut out 2021, 2022, and 2023, and put it next to 2024, we're still seeing an increase,\" Esquibel explains. \"Science has shown that harsher criminal penalties do not make significant changes in drug use patterns.\"Esquibel says drug use patterns are driven by cartels, which prey on drug users with the strategy of supply, addiction and demand. So if the science is clear that harsher criminal penalties don't work, why were they included in the bill?\"It's this reaction that people have,\" he says. \"People are desperate, people lose loved ones and get really frustrated about this increase in deaths, and they're reaching for anything. One of the reactions is, let's just keep penalizing people for using drugs and hope this is going to scare people.\"Medications like naloxone, which can reduce overdoses, and methadone and buprenorphine \u2014 FDA-approved medications that can help people stop or reduce their opioid use \u2014 are underused in the population most affected by overdose deaths, Esquibel argues. He points out that access to those medications has been sparse in Aurora on the east side of the Denver metro, which has the highest Black population. According to Esquibel, he and his organization have been \"banding together with leaders of the Black community to look at ways to increase access to treatment, access to Naloxone (which can reverse overdoses), and access to recovery.\"Lisa Raville, executive director of the Harm Reduction Action Center, is a little more blunt in her criticism of HB 1326.\"We call it a trash piece of legislation,\" she says of the law. \"[The report is a] reminder that they will never treatment or incarcerate their way out of an unregulated drug supply \u2014 ever. There were mandatory treatment provisions [in the law], which is not evidence-based care.\"Jurecka, lead author of the reports, says he and his colleagues will continue to track the effects of the 2022 fentanyl laws as further data becomes available.

That\u2019s down slightly from 311 the prior year.\n\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office was able to determine the cause of death for 216 people who died in Denver. Among those, 68% died from overdose \u2014 and most of those overdoses, 75% of them, were due to fentanyl. That\u2019s 115 deaths attributed to fentanyl out of 153 overdose deaths.\n\nOverdose deaths had increased by 18% in 2023, but plateaued this year, dropping 0.6%. It was the first year since 2017 that overdose deaths did not rise.\n\nThe homicide rate among people who are homelesshas declined the past two years \u2014 down 4.4% this year and 5.4% last year. Deaths by suicide, meanwhile, accounted for almost 5% of all deaths this year, compared with about 2% last year.\n\nRisk factors for suicide, including mental illness, drug and alcohol use, and isolation, are associated with homelessness.\n\nThe Coalition for the Homeless plans to remember those who died at an annual vigil Saturday, which is the longest night of the year. It\u2019s the 35th annual event in which people who work to provide shelter, food and health care to the homeless throughout the year gather at the steps of the Denver City and County Building, surrounded by luminaries, to read the names of those who died. The public is invited to attend and encouraged to bring donations of new adult coats, socks and gloves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to honor individuals and report on their deaths in the greatest detail possible because this may be the only acknowledgement some receive,\u201d the coalition wrote in its report.\n\nThe average age of death for a person who was homeless this year in Denver was 46. That\u2019s below the 2022 average of 50.5 and far below the average U.S. life expectancy of 77.5.\n\nFor those who went from homelessness to housing in one of the coalition\u2019s apartment buildings, the average age of death jumped 13 years, to age 59. Housing also had a profound effect on the overall death rate and the number of people who died by overdose. Among those who died while living in coalition housing, 17.2% died of overdose, compared with 68% of those who were homeless.\n\nOverdose deaths among people who are homeless across the nation have slowed in recent years. After rising steadily for two decades, overdose deaths decreased 17% nationally from July 2023 to July 2024. Still, this equates to about 100,000 overdose deaths this year.\n\n\u201cThese losses are catastrophic, unacceptable and largely preventable,\u201d the coalition wrote.\n\nThe nonprofit advocated for expanded access to treatment, including more syringe exchange programs. The coalition supports a Denver City Council proposal that would loosen restrictions on the number of needle exchange sites, which is currently capped at three, and a requirement that they are at least 1,000 feet from schools or day care centers. The sites provide naloxone, which can revive people who have overdosed, as well as test strips to check drugs for fentanyl.\n\nThe coalition provides medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction in Denver and runs a treatment program at Fort Lyon, a former Army fort outside of Las Animas in southeastern Colorado. The coalition added 215 apartments this year, and converted a nine-story hotel and convention center in Globeville into a supportive housing residence called Renewal Village.", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com", "article_id": "73fdfc62-0632-4b89-bf35-46d54c8324ed", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

According to the Centers for Disease Control, total overdose deaths in the state dropped from 1,998 to 1,637 between December 2022 and November 2024 - a 18.1% decrease.\n\nOpioid-related deaths saw an even sharper decline of 28.5%, and fentanyl-involved deaths fell 35.1%, from 1,238 to 804.\n\nCBS\n\n\"We haven't seen a drop like this ever,\" said Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. \"The opioid crisis started in the 1990s in the boardroom, pushing pills. It moved to heroin. It's now fentanyl. In the last year, we saw fentanyl deaths drop by 35%. That's over 400 lives that we saved this year. This is a meaningful reduction.\"\n\nWeiser credited the drop to a comprehensive statewide strategy that includes expanded access to Naloxone, funding for treatment programs, and targeted law enforcement.\n\n\"It starts with Narcan being available everywhere,\" Weiser said. \"If someone is going through an overdose, it can save their lives. That's probably the biggest reason.\"\n\nIn addition to prevention, Colorado has allocated over $100 million from opioid settlement funds to expand treatment and recovery.\n\nThe state has also cracked down on trafficking and digital access, like social media.\n\n\"We're going after cartels who are pushing fentanyl,\" he said. \"We're trying to make sure that those who sell fentanyl and someone dies, does real time. It's now a felony in Colorado.\"\n\nFor those on the front lines, awareness campaigns have played a pivotal role.\n\n\"There are a lot of folks who are now carrying Narcan. I have patients all the time who say, 'I had to use it the other day.' That's helping prevent people from dying,\" said Chris Gillespie, a physician assistant at Community Medical Services.\n\nHe believes awareness, especially among young people, is making an impact.\n\nKeith Spencer CBS\n\n\"This is one of the deadliest drugs we've ever seen,\" Gillespie said. \"Making sure they're aware - whether it's parents, educators, or providers like myself - I think it is helping save lives.\"\n\nKeith Spencer, a recovering addict who now mentors others, knows the devastation fentanyl can cause. Spencer's younger brother died from a fentanyl overdose.\n\n\"He got unlucky. He got a more potent dose than I did,\" he said. \"A lot of people around me were dying\u2026 This ends one of two ways: I either go to prison for a long time or I'm gonna die.\"\n\nFor Spencer, sobriety didn't come easily. He's found success through The Other Side Academy and now works in their furniture warehouse.\n\n\"Fewer death means awareness. People realize they're not just dealing with your typical narcotic. They're dealing with an acute poison,\" said Spencer. \"I'm very proud of that number. It shows success in what we're doing here, especially in Colorado. There's not going to be any shortage of drug epidemics in the next 100 years. So it's really good we figured out something that kind of works.\"\n\nDespite the encouraging numbers, state leaders and advocates stress that the fight is far from over.\n\n\"We can't take our foot off the gas,\" Weiser said. \"We just went to court against the Trump administration, which is trying to take back funding used for critical responses to this substance abuse crisis. We'll keep standing up to help save lives.\"\n\nWeiser says the state's Connect Effect campaign demonstrates the power of connection to protect teens. As the campaign notes, 87% of teens would try to protect their friends from this deadly threat. He says it uses the science of positive social norms to highlight that most teens are making healthy choices, giving youth confidence that they are in good company when they don't take unprescribed pills.\n\n\"Every Coloradan has a role to play here. First, make sure that we're talking about this crisis. Chances are you know people, friends, families, colleagues, who are struggling and who are affected by this crisis,\" said Weiser. \"For those who are struggling, get help.

Carfentanil is an animal tranquilizer used to sedate or put down animals the size of elephants and rhinoceroses. Last month, the DEA said a seizure of 250,000 pills was determined to contain carfentanil which is 100 times more potent than fentanyl.\n\nAdditional Information from the DEA RMFD:\n\nWhile it took Colorado eleven months to break last year's record pill seizures, Utah broke its pill seizure record (668,000) in the first six months this year (774,000). Within the DEA Rocky Mountain Field Division, Wyoming and Montana have seen pill seizures trend lower over the course of 2024.\n\nLast year's pill seizure total for the entire four-state Division was approximately 3.4 million pills seized. 2024 Division numbers will likely be released in late January 2025.", "source_domain": "www.cbsnews.com", "article_id": "82adcbfd-22e0-4bbb-85fb-6e98056030b3", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Jared Polis, in response to Scripps News\u2019 investigation .\n\nWhat happened in each case\n\nMore than a year before Aviyana\u2019s death, a Colorado State Patrol trooper pulled over Aviyana\u2019s father while she was riding in his car.\n\nThe officer arrested him for drug and child abuse charges but did not notify child welfare workers about the incident , in violation of the agency\u2019s policy, according to Sgt. Patrick Rice, a spokesperson for the agency.\n\n\u201cOur policy is that the responding trooper contact a CSP victim's advocate to work with human services and the family, or contact human services directly,\u201d said Rice.\n\nIn the Aurora case, first responders revived a mother with the opioid reversal antidote, naloxone, after she passed out behind the wheel of her vehicle with her child in the car.\n\nNo one alerted child welfare workers about the incident, according to Joe Moylan, a spokesperson for the Aurora Police Department, and about nine months later, the child died of fentanyl poisoning.\n\n\u201cThe officer was disciplined and suspended for 20 hours without pay,\u201d Moylan said.\n\nWhat lawmakers are saying\n\n\u201cEspecially having seen your story, I think it\u2019s critical that we take a look and see what is missing in the breakdown in that communication,\u201d said Rep. Chad Clifford, a Democrat who sits on Colorado\u2019s legislative judiciary committee.\n\nIn Colorado , \u201cmandatory reporters,\u201d including peace officers, physicians, school employees, and many others, are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect to either a county child welfare agency, to the child abuse hotline, or a local law enforcement agency.\n\nHowever, police officers are not mandated, under state law, to report child abuse claims directly to child welfare workers, according to the Colorado Office of the Attorney General.\n\n\u201cStatute requires peace officers to report suspected child abuse, but that can be to a law enforcement agency or child protective services,\u201d said Lawrence Pacheco, a spokesperson for Colorado\u2019s Office of the Attorney General.\n\n\u201cThere is not a specific requirement that cases are reported to child protective services, although many agencies have individual policies in place to require this type of reporting,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we definitely need to address this some way with legislation,\u201d Rep. Clifford said.\n\n\u201cI would assert that there are police departments around the state and sheriff\u2019s departments that do have good communications and relationships with child protective services,\" he said. \"I think we should probably take a look at what has been working in areas - if it is - and get some feedback ... and then codify something, so that it\u2019s more universal.\u201d\n\nState Sen. John Carson, a Republican who sits on the state\u2019s judiciary and health and human services committees, said he believes communication should be enhanced.\n\n\u201cWhat you reported on...indicates we do need to have more communication out there at all levels of society,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more education to parents. We need more education to law enforcement. We need education here at the Capitol with state legislators. And we\u2019ve got to figure out how to get a handle on this and prevent more deaths.\u201d\n\nCarson said he is a proponent of increasing penalties for possessing fentanyl, and if he believes it is warranted, he would consider a new law.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s legislation or work we need to do to improve that communication, I would want to take a look at that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in looking at anything that might help. But a lot of times you find there\u2019s a lot of legislation already out there \u2013 a lot of regulations already out there \u2013 they're just not being followed...we ought to first take a look at that and make sure that the agencies are following the guidelines and the rules and that it\u2019s a top priority.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Polis said the issue is important.\n\n\u201cGovernor Polis is open to ideas that keep our kids safe and prevent this type of communication breakdown from occurring again, ensuring that Colorado\u2019s Division of Child Welfare has the information it needs to protect Colorado kids. Governor Polis is committed to making Colorado one of the top ten safest states, and that includes protecting our communities and kids from the scourge of fentanyl,\u201d said Wieman.\n\nAn ongoing problem\n\nCommunication issues like these have been a problem for many years, according to state records reviewed by Scripps News.\n\nThe Child Fatality Prevention System \u2014 which is administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment \u2014 reported \u201ca need to address issues with information sharing between agencies,\u201d as far back as 2016 .\n\nScripps News also repeatedly found similar recommendations for improved communication in annual reports prepared by the state\u2019s Child Fatality Review Team , which operates under the Colorado Department of Human Services .\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to be in progress for a while,\u201d April Jenkins, a manager for CDHS's child protection and prevention unit, told Scripps News in December last year.\n\nIn response to questions about how communication issues would be addressed by CDHS, a spokesperson told Scripps News that it was planning a \u201cworkgroup\u201d that would focus on \u201cdesigning standard protocols for enhancing working relationships and communication\u201d between human services, social services, and law enforcement agencies statewide.\n\nA CDHS spokesperson told Scripps News that a preliminary planning group met last week and planned to reach out to counties and law enforcement agencies to participate in the workgroup.\n\nLouisiana state investigation identifies similar breakdown\n\nScripps News also found similar communication breakdowns in other states.", "source_domain": "www.scrippsnews.com", "article_id": "42d9a286-e778-4047-b01e-ff715ea274ca", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

None of the active cases have been decided yet.\n\n\"From my point of view on the prosecutorial end of it, it's basically one more thing we have in our toolbag to handle these types of deaths,\" Harris County DA's office's major narcotics section chief Garrett Moore said. \"The ability to prosecute this type of offense existed before, but it was tied very closely to the weight of the amount delivered.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, 317 people died from a fentanyl overdose in Texas, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. By 2022, that number had skyrocketed to over 2,000. According to the same data, Harris County ranks number one in the state for fentanyl overdose deaths with 487 in 2022.\n\n\"When it's used in a non-medical and non-controlled environment, it very much is akin to poison,\" Moore said. \"The goal is always to get dealers, to get people who are trafficking and to make sure that they're held accountable for the trafficking they're conducting.\"\n\nMoore said the DA's office also has programs for those who are believed to be addicted to fentanyl, or other dangerous drugs.\n\n\"There's a delineation, both factually, within our office and legally, between possession and possession with intent or delivery,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve got programs like RIC [Reintegration] Court here that are designed to help people who are recovering and are dealing with addiction issues. Then there's major narcotics, which is my section, that handles the fentanyl ... people who are dealing this stuff to turn a profit as a living.\"\n\nAlthough Moore said he doesn't directly keep up with the local statistics around fentanyl prosecutions, he has personally seen an uptick recently in the number of eligible cases.\n\n\"In terms of the cases we're seeing that are being investigated, [that] are being tied back to dealers \u2014 whether they're being charged or not \u2014 that is going up anecdotally,\" he said. \"I think it's partially because of evolving investigative techniques that officers on the front lines of this are dealing with these cases [that are] becoming more and more common.

In a statement responding to the White House's proposed solutions, Maritza Perez Medina, the director of federal affairs at DPA, said similar proposals have not worked.\n\n\"The Administration is doubling down on the same failed drug war tactics of the past, rather than prioritizing the public health strategies that will actually save lives,\" she said. \"We know that supply-side strategies and criminalization only exacerbate negative health outcomes and create further barriers to treatment, housing, and stability.\"\n\nPerez continued in her statement and said that the focus should include more research into health services.\n\n\"With thousands of lives at stake, it is imperative for the Administration and Congress to focus on evidence-based solutions that save lives, rather than disproven tactics as a false promise of change,\" she said.", "source_domain": "www.houstonpublicmedia.org", "article_id": "9f38f720-30d7-463f-ae0e-2b3aa82f07a7", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Young people deserve access to this education, and young people are not the only ones dying.\u201d\n\nHe said that the nation\u2019s elderly are also dying at much higher rates from unintentional fentanyl overdoses. Several university and government research sources say that overdoses among Americans over 65 have quadrupled over the past decade.\n\nOverdoses in all age groups spiked during the pandemic and only recently started to decrease again, after mass education, reduced stigma and naloxone availability became more common practice.\n\nThe age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths nationwide increased from 8.9 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2003 to 32.6 in 2022, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate decreased to 31.3 in 2023. Those rates decreased between 2022 and 2023 for people ages 15\u201354, but increased for adults aged 55 and older.\n\nColorado had similar numbers, showing a minor increase in overdose deaths from 1,799 in 2022 to 1,865 in 2023, according to the Colorado Center for Health and Environmental Data. There was a more significant increase in opioid-related deaths from 1,160 in 2022 to 1,292 in 2023. All of the younger age groups decreased from 2022 to 2023, but all age groups older than 35 years increased in overdose deaths during that time.\n\nOf the opioid related deaths in 2023, 311 occurred in Adams and Arapahoe Counties, and an additional 39 in Douglas County, totaling 350 lives in all three counties, an increase of 30 deaths from 2022.\n\nThere were 442 non-fatal opioid overdose-related emergency department visits in Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas Counties in 2023, Calli Tucker, Aurora\u2019s Crisis Intervention Program administrator, said during a study session in April.\n\nIt means those three counties had more people who were saved from overdoses than people who died.\n\nA report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a 13.9% decrease in fatal overdoses in Colorado from October 2023 to October 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nThe deaths caused by synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, dropped 28.5%, from 1,192 to 852, according to the article. Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention, which is part of CU Anschutz\u2019s Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said that one reason the fatal overdose rate has declined is that naloxone is readily available for anyone to have.\n\n\u201cResearch showed that 73.3% of drug overdose deaths in Colorado in 2023 had at least one potential opportunity for intervention, most often by a bystander,\u201d Tucker said during the meeting. \u201cWhich speaks to why the focus on opioid abatement fund strategies is so crucial.\u201d FILE \u2013 The overdose-reversal drug Narcan is displayed during training for employees of the Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC), Dec. 4, 2018, in Philadelphia. Drug overdose deaths in Kentucky fell nearly 10% in 2023, marking a second straight decline in the fight against an addiction epidemic that\u2019s far from over, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nProven Solutions\n\nWhether the person has an addiction, is using drugs recreationally or is experimenting for the first time, the first and most important step is keeping people alive to recover and move on, addiction experts say.\n\n\u201cWe can only help a person to lead a productive life if they are alive,\u201d said Dr. Aleksandra Zgierska, professor of family and addiction medicine at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cOnly then, they can enter treatment, only then, they can learn from their mistakes, however we approach it, but it\u2019s only under those circumstances. So keeping people alive is our primary goal.\u201d\n\nNaloxone is an opioid overdose antidote that works by essentially bumping the opioid off key receptors in the brain, a mechanism that helps reverse overdose symptoms like slow breathing, Dr. Brandon Marshall, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University, said.\n\n\u201cNaloxone, as a substance, is used to reverse overdose, not to prevent overdose,\u201d Zgierska said. \u201cPeople are dead unless naloxone is administered by bystanders, which means that everybody should have naloxone to help those who overdose.\u201d\n\nNarcan is the popular brand name for naloxone. All forms of naloxone are considered safe, and naloxone can now be obtained without a prescription in every state, as mandated by law. Naloxone, as a nasal spray, can be easily administered to someone who is experiencing an overdose.\n\nBystanders who administer naloxone are advised by professionals to call 911 and, ideally, perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the person regains consciousness. If the person does not respond after three minutes, professionals recommend administering additional doses of naloxone. The need for added doses has become more common with \u201csuper fentanyl\u201d like nitazenes, which are another form of synthetic opioids that can sometimes be more potent than fentanyl.\n\nDr. Eric Hill, the medical director for Aurora Fire and Rescue, said that there is still oxygen in the blood that can somewhat prolong the time of brain cell death. He said that administering mouth-to-mouth breathing to the person can help keep oxygen flowing to the brain. He said naloxone and mouth-to-mouth can both greatly aid emergency responders as a life-saving measure while they are en route.\n\n\u201cIn terms of Aurora Fire\u2019s travel times, 90% of AFR\u2019s departmentwide travel time for first-arriving apparatus for fires and medical emergencies in 2024 were within 6 minutes, 42 seconds or less,\u201d City of Aurora spokesperson Jennifer Soules said in an email.\n\nJust because the person is conscious doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need to see a doctor immediately. Naloxone is used to revive and stabilize the person before they are taken to the hospital or to see a doctor.\n\nThat doctor visit also provides professionals with an opportunity to discuss addiction treatment options with the patient, if it\u2019s warranted.\n\n\u201cAddiction is a chronic disease and requires treatment by healthcare professionals,\u201d Zgierska said.\n\nZgierska said that an overdose gives medical professionals a better ability to speak with people face-to-face and refer them to possible treatment opportunities. Stigmatization can make it more challenging for individuals to seek help.\n\n\u201cIf we further stigmatize drug use and addiction, it\u2019ll be harder and harder to bring people to treatment or even disclose that they have a problem,\u201d Zgierska said.\n\nA \u201cnon-judgmental tone\u201d is a significant factor in one of their opioid prevention campaigns, dubbed \u201cKeep The Party Safe.\u201d\n\nKeep The Party Safe, which is led locally by the consortium with CU Anschutz, is aimed at occasional and recreational drug users between the ages of 18 and 45 who are unaware that fentanyl can be found in drugs including cocaine, MDMA, meth and heroin. Counterfeit versions of prescription drugs, including Xanax and OxyContin, are also a danger, according to a research article from CU Anschutz.\n\n\u201cResearch shows that when naloxone is made more widely available, overdose deaths decrease,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cOne potential barrier I want to highlight is cost. Some pharmacies may charge upwards of $50 for just one naloxone kit, which could be unaffordable to many people who might benefit from having naloxone and administering it in the case of an overdose.\u201d\n\nZgierska and Dr. Alice Zhang, assistant professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Pennsylvania State University, is the lead author of the review on the effectiveness of naloxone vending machines with Dr. Zgierska.\n\n\u201cOne aspect of the vending machine that is not available through traditional means is that it\u2019s available 24/7,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cIt\u2019s available after hours when businesses are closed. We\u2019re seeing data from our vending machines that they\u2019re being used from like 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., so that\u2019s when most people aren\u2019t typically awake.\u201d\n\nZhang said they also found from a survey given through the smart vending machines that 38% of the people said they were getting naloxone to be prepared if they encounter an accidental overdose.\n\n\u201cSome of the survey data that we have showed that over half of the respondents thought that the vending machine was able to help reduce stigma around addiction and naloxone,\u201d Zhang said.\n\nTypical over-the-counter pricing for Narcan is $50 for a two-pack of nasal spray. In 2019, the state of Colorado created the Opiate Antagonist Bulk Purchase Fund, which provides free naloxone to qualifying entities. The problem is that KFF Health News reported last year that the fund is quickly depleting.\n\nOther funds are coming from legal settlements after the opioid crisis, but those funds are also limited and reserved for all opioid prevention and abatement measures.\n\nAurora is on track to receive more than $3.4 million over the next 17 years as part of Colorado\u2019s share of national opioid settlement funds to help combat the opioid crisis.\n\nThe grant funds come from legal settlements with pharmaceutical companies, distributors and retailers found to be responsible for fueling the opioid epidemic, Tucker said during the study session.\n\nAs of 2024, $1,737,942 in opioid settlement funds have been made available to the city, with only $245,540 approved so far for vans and buses to transport people to and from the Aurora Navigation Campus. The center is Aurora\u2019s work-first, one-stop shop facility for handling homelessness in Aurora. It\u2019s expected to open later this year.\n\nAn agreement with the state allows expenditures to fall within specific areas, including treatment, prevention, services for children, support for first responders, community leadership, staffing and training, research and related administrative costs.\n\nAccording to Tucker, city staff proposed four initial funding projects based on the city\u2019s history and available evidence:\n\nConsulting services to access Medicaid billing, estimated at $125,000.\n\nImplement naloxone vending/resource distribution sites, estimated at about $10,000 for each site, possibly two or more sites.\n\nExpanded emergency medical services for opioid overdoses, estimated at $112,000\n\nExpanded intervention services in response to opioid overdoses, estimated at $55,000-$87,000 per site, with possibly two sites.\n\nAlthough there has been recent national news about Medicaid funding cuts, the opioid settlement money appears to still be secure, according to city officials.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nAddiction has little to do with resolution\n\n\u201cIt does not matter what you look like, or where you\u2019re from,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cAddiction does not discriminate, and we are tired of hearing that it\u2019s just the addict\u2019s problem. We are people. We are humans, and we deserve respect and support, period.\n\nOne in five teens has already tried prescription drugs illegally, according to the Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse. The majority, 76% of these teenagers, buy these prescription pills illegally, according to the 17th Judicial District Fentanyl Fact Sheet.\n\n\u201cAddiction is part of the inability to process pain,\u201d Alverez said. \u201cSo you can address that deeper core issue, that\u2019s where you start to see that form of recovery. But it takes a community.\u201d\n\nThe pipeline from experimenting to misuse and addiction is not far. Repeated studies have found that in many cases, addiction behaviors can serve as coping mechanisms for physical and psychological pain, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nThrough Rise Together, Alvarado has taught more than 300,000 students about substance use and mental health. The crisis impacts people across all demographics \u2013 from high school cheerleaders to students from various socioeconomic backgrounds, according to Alvarado.\n\nAddiction is usually about underlying systemic issues like poverty, disconnection and unprocessed pain, Alvarado said. The settlement grant money the city is receiving for opioid prevention and treatment is from pharmaceutical companies taking advantage of those issues, prioritizing profits over people, and creating easily accessible addictive medications.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever be that person who says it will never happen to you because until it impacts you personally, whether it\u2019s a loved one, a family member, a child, a cousin, brother, uncle, sister, you name it,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cThe stories, while they might be different, nobody went into it thinking, oh, man, I\u2019m going to be an addict and I\u2019m going to die from this substance.\u201d\n\nIf anything, being saved from an overdose can create a \u201ccascading\u201d effect where people who live through an overdose are more likely to become advocates who want to save other people\u2019s lives, Zgierska said.\n\nSimilarly, having access to naloxone does not enable people to indulge in their addictions.\n\n\u201cResearch dispels concerns raised by some people in the past that naloxone\u2019s availability may increase someone\u2019s likelihood to take more drugs,\u201d Zgierska said. \u201cIn fact, research confirms the opposite \u2013 lack of naloxone\u2019s availability increases the likelihood of death.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alvarado, communities must approach addiction with compassion, education and support. By reducing stigma and increasing access to resources such as Narcan, lives can be saved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of mental weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a matter of maybe mental fitness to be part of that conversation. It goes back to more access to education and more support for people who are struggling in the process, and that they\u2019re experiencing life in a healthy way.\u201d", "source_domain": "sentinelcolorado.com", "article_id": "c132b824-88fd-4c8a-a7c9-8b92153b0605", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

There was crimes of violence,\" explained Jonathan Pullen, special agent in charge for the DEA Rocky Mountain Division.\n\nAccording to Pullen, the illegal drugs at the party were supplied by the Sinaloa cartel, and the DEA is putting their foot on the gas when it comes to getting drugs off the streets, especially when it comes to fentanyl.\n\n\"In fact, we've seized enormous amounts of fentanyl this year,\" Pullen said. \"I actually thought we would seize less.

{"url": "https://filtermag.org/colorado-refelonizing-fentanyl-no-good/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Increasing criminal penalties for fentanyl had zero impact on overdose deaths in Colorado and accomplished nothing good. That\u2019s the result of a study commissioned by the state itself to research outcomes of a law that refelonized fentanyl possession charges.\n\nIn 2022, Colorado lawmakers took a step that they claimed would help reduce overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The legislature and Governor Jared Polis (D) signed off on a bill to create harsher criminal penalties. Possession of 1-4 grams of any substance containing fentanyl would now be charged as a Level 4 felony, when it was previously a misdemeanor. Anyone convicted would also be mandated to undergo a substance use disorder assessment, and possibly court-ordered treatment.\n\nThe bill did also include harm reduction measures, such as $19.7 million in funding for distribution of naloxone and fentanyl test strips, and increased mental health services. Another $3 million in funding went towards expanding opioid treatment in correctional facilities. However, the criminal penalties took effect in July 2022\u2014a year before any money was distributed for these services.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised by the fact that overdose did not decrease, and stayed the same or increased for certain populations.\u201d\n\nThe state required a study assessing the efficacy of this new law, and commissioned a team including researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Kaiser Permanente Colorado Institute for Health Research. Their research, published in January, looked at changes from 2018-2024 and found no correlation between increased felony charges and reduced overdose deaths.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised by the fact that overdose did not decrease, and stayed the same or increased for certain populations,\u201d one it its co-authors, Cole Jurecka, MPH, a senior research services professional at Colorado School of Medicine, told Filter.\n\nOther benefits the law\u2019s proponents had anticipated did not materialize either. The researchers looked into whether the law made people more likely to seek medications for opioid use disorder like buprenorphine, or more likely to stay on such medications.\n\n\u201cThe most surprising finding for me,\u201d Jurecka said, \u201cwas that retention on certain medications for opioid use disorder did not increase\u2014in fact, [it] decreased for methadone\u2014given the fact there were some small provisions in the law that would in theory help people access these drugs more easily. That was not the case.\u201d\n\nBeginning in 2018, there was an overall increase in people starting buprenorphine treatment in Colorado, but that trend wasn\u2019t affected by the new law, the researchers found. Regarding methadone treatment, there was no change in initiation\u2014but a decrease in people continuing treatment after the law took effect.\n\nFelonization\u2019s lack of impact on overdose deaths was in line with Jurecka\u2019s expectations, he said, due to prior scientific literature which \u201ctells me that increasing criminal penalties does not improve health outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was money spent on expanding services, but it\u2019s hard to disentangle from the criminal penalties. Pairing these together is a catalyst of fear for people who would need access.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the overall outcomes of the Colorado research, Jurecka noted that the felony penalties and increased treatment funding are policies that are at odds with each other.\n\n\u201cThere are two things at play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was money spent on expanding these services, but it\u2019s hard to disentangle from the criminal penalties. Pairing these together is a catalyst of fear for people who would need to access these services. Imagine someone who needs these medications, but is afraid of punishment. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think there was any real change.\u201d\n\nHowever, the authors were unable to demonstrate that the decrease in people continuing methadone treatment after the law took effect was caused by the law itself. \u201cCaution is urged in interpreting these results as the methadone data does not include observations of all patients receiving methadone treatment and reporting standards changed for methadone clinics during the study period,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThere was no significant change in overdose rates associated with the law over the time period studied, although there was a major spike during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers found that non-Hispanic Black residents had higher overdose rates in four of the 16 months following the law\u2019s passage, compared with the equivalent prior period. But again, they stated that they couldn\u2019t conclude this was because of the law.\n\nLooking at the law\u2019s criminal-legal impact, the researchers found that totals of opioid possession-related convictions actually stayed consistent between 2020-2024, even in the severity of charges increased. The demographics most subjected to these convictions were, in order, Black, Hispanic and white residents. The authors did not find data on how many people were diverted from prison or jail to court-mandated treatment.\n\n\u201cCommunity members across the spectrum of experiences, including law enforcement professionals, perceived fentanyl possession criminal penalties to be misguided.\u201d\n\nAnd in speaking with 31 policymakers, peer support specialists, police and health care providers, the researchers found that these stakeholders were not happy with how the goals of reducing overdose and expanding treatment were being pursued.\n\n\u201cThe qualitative analyses suggest that community members across the spectrum of experiences, including law enforcement professionals, perceived fentanyl possession criminal penalties to be misguided,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand that expanding services including medications, other treatment services, and diversion options would be more likely to reduce overdose rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cParticipants largely discussed [the bill as having] been driven by emotional responses rather than empirical evidence,\u201d they continued. \u201cWhile the policy was initially aimed at penalizing those distributing fentanyl, which participants largely agreed this policy should focus on, in practice, the policy continued to target people who use drugs and people engaging in subsistence level drug distribution.\u201d\n\nSome years prior, Colorado lawmakers had taken a different approach to drug use. In 2019, they approved a measure to reduce penalties for possession of many substances (up to 4 grams) to a misdemeanor. That included fentanyl as well as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Sales and distribution charges remained felonies.\n\nBut politicians soon began to attack this limited reform. Lawmakers initially advanced the current law after a tragedy in which five people died of apparent fentanyl-involved overdose at an apartment complex in Commerce City. Numerous politicians, including Governor Polis, endorsed repealing the 2019 defelonization for fentanyl. The resulting refelonization law was a compromise of sorts\u2014some Republicans wanted to go much further by imposing 250year mandatory minimum sentences and classifying fentanyl as a \u201cweapon of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nHarm reduction advocates blasted the repeal effort. \u201cThey keep wanting to incarcerate folks and that has never worked,\u201d Lisa Raville, executive director of the Harm Reduction Action Center in Denver, told Filter at the time. \u201cAll that has done is drive use underground. We are in a public health emergency that demands a public health approach.\u201d\n\nMonths after the law took effect, Kevin Franciotti reported for Filter on consequences which included police treating drug users more aggressively, community organizations fearful that distributing fentanyl test strips could implicate people, and individuals scared to call 911 in case of an overdose.\n\nJurecka noted that Colorado saw a small decrease in overdose deaths in 2024, according to CDC data, yet groups including Black and Indigenous residents continue to face increasing overdose rates. He urged lawmakers to embrace a public health approach.\n\n\u201cExpanding access to treatment works,\u201d Jurecka said. \u201cWe have so much evidence that confirms the efficacy of medications for opioid use disorder\u2014but it must be disentangled from increasing criminal penalties. Our 50-year history with the War on Drugs [shows] these do not improve health outcomes.\u201d\n\nImage of Colorado State University police by Alex Smith used via Flickr/public domain.", "source_domain": "filtermag.org", "article_id": "1b1fa3cd-53cb-47df-926e-2c1993a9554d", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

According to his arrest affidavit, they found more than 3,000 fentanyl pills. According to what was said Friday, some of the drugs were hidden in the bathroom and others, in a bag in the wall.\n\nAdditionally, police reported finding a smaller amount of suspected methamphetamine and a powdery substance. The latter, according to what was said at sentencing, was likely baking soda, and was not drugs. As well, seven firearms were recovered and one of them had been reported stolen. Officers also recovered about $2,200 in cash.\n\nBlair was initially arrested on suspicion of several offenses. According to Delta Combined Court records, he pleaded guilty to introducing a controlled substance as a high-level drug felony, and to possession of a controlled substance for the methamphetamine.\n\n\u201cI know better than this,\u201d Blair said toward the end of his hearing Friday, after apologizing. \u201cI was just in a bad time.\u201d He said his life spiraled after losing his mother and his divorce, while his attorney said a woman who was his mainstay of structure and support faltered.\n\n\u201cIt is a dangerous drug. It is bad. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d Blair said of fentanyl. He noted his sons need him, that he has employment and a home. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is a second chance.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Deputy District Attorney Aubrey Thompson asked for prison to be imposed, because it was clear to her that Blair had distribution-quantity drugs, despite reported claims that instead, he was using 100 pills a day. Given the amount of pills found, that seemed impossible to her, as it would have meant he was ingesting more than six pills an hour and had enough to last 33 days.\n\n\u201cThe People do not find this believable. Fentanyl kills the community. That\u2019s very concerning,\u201d she said, asking for an eight-year term on the charge relating to fentanyl and a concurrent one-year term for his other offense, less 400 days of pre-sentence confinement.\n\nGiven Blair\u2019s prior conviction on a drug charge, prison time is appropriate, despite the fact that Blair successfully completed the community corrections sentence that was imposed in that 2018 matter, Thompson said. \u201cThis is not something that would have just affected Mr. Blair. This is something that could have killed multiple members of the community,\u201d she said. The quantity of pills and the risk to the community \u201cabsolutely\u201d called for the maximum allowable time in the Department of Corrections, she added. \u201cFor the safety of this community, I think a term in DOC \u2026 is absolutely what should be handed out by this court.\u201d\n\nA \u2018GOOD FATHER\u2019\n\nBut Blair is needed by his family and knows he made a mistake, his father said, asking Delta District Judge Steven Schultz to spare his son prison. He said he never heard that his son took 100 pills a day, but it was \u201cmore like\u201d 50 or 60.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a real good father. He bought his first house when he was 19. I gave him half of my business. I\u2019m constantly getting calls they want him back to work. He\u2019s missing the best part of his kids\u2019 lives,\u201d the man said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot going for him. I don\u2019t really want to see him in prison. I know guys that went to prison and they came out worse. He\u2019s remorseful. He knows he messed up and he doesn\u2019t blame anybody but himself.\u201d\n\nDefense attorney Anya Van Soestbergen said her client has already served more than a year in jail. She pushed for community corrections, arguing that would better fulfill the purposes of sentencing than would prison. She said Blair excelled in commcorr when he was sentenced to a term there in the 2018 case, graduating early, and being transferred to probation, which was also terminated early, based on his outstanding performance.\n\nShe acknowledged the court might say that despite his previous success, he is again before a judge to be sentenced. What happened was his support structure \u201ccrumbled,\u201d she said. When that happened \u201cSo did Mr. Blair.\u201d\n\nVan Soestbergen said Blair only blames himself, and knows he will have to forge and uphold his own support structure \u2014 community corrections will provide those tools better than continued incarceration, and will also reduce the risk of him slipping again. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in this room wants something like this to happen ever again,\u201d she said.\n\nThe attorney stressed she and Blair were not intending to downplay the risks of fentanyl. Community corrections would, however, provide Blair with what he needs to not become involved with it again. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t just impact Mr. Blair \u2026 it impacts the whole of Delta County,\u201d said Van Soestbergen.\n\nPILL POTENCY\n\nShe said there\u2019s disagreement on how much fentanyl can be personal use. Actual potency of each pill isn\u2019t tested \u2014 and that lack of certainty is part of what makes the opioid so dangerous, she said.\n\nSchultz said he did indeed review the 2018, over which he had presided. That one involved several different types of pills and allegations of distribution. Blair succeeded at a three-year commcorr sentence.\n\n\u201cThis is a different case. This involves the recovery of more than 3,000 fentanyl pills from his home,\u201d the judge said. Some were found under a sink in the bathroom, where there also was meth, and other fentanyl pills were found in a bag in the wall, Schultz said, also noting the presence of weapons.\n\n\u201cMr. Blair, to be frank, sir, I don\u2019t believe this is personal use in any way, shape or form,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cWe are talking thousands of pills, here. The court does not believe anyone is using 100 fentanyl pills a day.\u201d\n\nSchultz went through the purposes of sentencing, noting that two of the purposes can be at odds: rehabilitation and punishment. Although some factors in Blair\u2019s case marshaled for rehab, others did not.\n\nSchultz said he\u2019d been thinking about Blair\u2019s sentence all week. Blair\u2019s handling of his 2018 case showed the judge that Blair can be successful. \u201cThe problem is at the end of the success, you did not achieve rehabilitation,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nTo Schultz, that meant despite completing the sentence in that case, Blair was not successful \u2014 instead, he was before the court again, again for drugs. Although the judge said he believes Blair would succeed again at commcorr, he had no confidence Blair would achieve actual rehabilitation.\n\nHe sentenced Blair to six years in prison, instead of eight, and a one-year concurrent term for the meth offense; because Blair also received 400 days of credit for the time spent in jail during the pendency of his case, that means this part of the sentence is already satisfied.\n\nSchultz called fentanyl the most destructive drug to the community, and also cautioned Blair that due to newer laws, he would face far more time for fentanyl offenses if he became entangled in the drug again.\n\n\u201cI really expected you to do well. The problem I\u2019m having here is the way you come back in front of me,\u201d Schultz said, reiterating he did not think the amount of fentanyl found reflected personal use. \u201cYou\u2019re going to serve some time here and then be on parole. You\u2019ll be back in the community \u2026 it is imperative when you are released back into the community that you have no involvement in drugs again.\u201d\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nTags\nPrison Fentanyl Public Law Law Misconduct Law Enforcement Justice Criminal Justice Criminal Law Crime Common Law Sentence (law)", "source_domain": "www.gjsentinel.com", "article_id": "598ab41f-f865-4603-a35a-abd6d9ebcdd5", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

But important issues remain: lawmakers still need to deal with the depleted mental health workforce and to address gun violence without fueling stigma.\n\nGreg Hansch is executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of Texas. Colleen Horton is director of policy at the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nHansch says the Legislature accomplished a lot this past session, especially in terms of state hospitals and school mental health:\n\n\u201cA couple examples in this most recent legislative session of big successes were: funding for the state hospital system to modernize and reconstruct some of the facilities that are available there to improve quality and access \u2026 and we saw probably some of the most significant children\u2019s mental health reforms that we\u2019ve ever seen in this state, really leveraging schools as an opportunity to intervene early.\u201d\n\nHorton says the Legislature failed to address the state\u2019s mental health workforce:\n\n\u201cWe have an extreme workforce shortage in Texas when it comes to mental health care. And we have to look more at why our percentage of doctors who participate in the Medicaid program is so low.\u201d\n\nHorton also says there\u2019s underlying causes to mental health conditions that are often overlooked:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often about the societal illnesses that create communities that aren\u2019t mentally well, or mentally healthy. \u2026 We also have to think about, especially when we talk about violence, is the societal illnesses such as racism, bigotry, social isolation, despair, anger \u2013 those things aren\u2019t mental illnesses. But research has shown that they are the cause of much of the violence that we have in our country.\u201d\n\nImproving mental health is a bipartisan issue in Texas, but Hansch says it often gets lost among other policy priorities:\n\n\u201cIn the last legislative session, funding for the public education system and addressing property taxes were the signature issues.\u201d\n\nHansch expects mental health and the criminal justice system to be a key topic for lawmakers during the 2021 session:\n\n\u201cOne of the big points of conversation in [the] next legislative session is going to be how well are judges, county officials, sheriffs and other local decision-makers \u2026 working together and with the state to change the fact that the criminal justice system is the default provider, or the default setting, where people with mental health conditions end up.\u201d\n\nHansch says recent mass shootings have been catalysts for improving the mental health care system:\n\n\u201cI think there are better reasons to address mental health in our state than trying to address mass shootings, but my sense is that the train has left the station. The Legislature is going to look at the root causes of mass shootings and keep identifying mental health as one of those factors.\u201d\n\nBut Hansch says it\u2019s unclear what legislation could come out of these moments of crisis:\n\n\u201cI do think we\u2019re going to have a robust conversation about access to firearms. In some cases, we can see how a person with a mental health condition who has access to a firearm can be a dangerous situation \u2026 to [themselves], but we also need to think about danger to others.\u201d\n\nHorton says blaming mass shootings exclusively on mental illness fuels stigma:\n\n\u201c[It] can really do a lot of damage and create a lot of stigma that will prevent people from seeking out mental health services. If we talk about creating registries \u2026 then how many people will be willing to go to a mental health professional and get assessed?\u201d\n\nHansch says NAMI supported proposals for so-called red flag gun laws that don\u2019t single out those with mental health conditions:\n\n\u201cOur support for those proposals only exists because those proposals don\u2019t specifically target people with mental health conditions. The way that a red flag law should be designed is that it targets people who are exhibiting dangerous behavior, and the judge has discretion about what constitutes [that].\u201d\n\nRates of mental illness are similar in other countries, but not rates of gun violence, Horton says:\n\n\u201cOther countries have the same rate of mental illness and mental health conditions as we do in our country and they don\u2019t have the same rates of gun violence and mass shootings.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s essential that those living with mental health conditions participate in policymaking, Horton says:\n\n\u201cHaving the person with lived experience of mental health conditions and substance use conditions at the table, in the hearing rooms, at the agency \u2026 far too often advocates and family members and policymakers think we know how to do it, think we know what people need, and we often don\u2019t.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org", "article_id": "18ff44ff-369b-429b-b13a-4b7e275d95f2", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Despite federal protections, Keller said there\u2019s a lack of mental health parity, which means equitable coverage under insurance for health and mental health issues.\n\n\u201cUntil we really have a common standard for mental health, we\u2019re not going to be able to make progress,\u201d he said.\n\nKeller said there\u2019s also a need for more prevention strategies for kids and their families. Kids can have symptoms of anxiety as early as eight years old, and often these symptoms manifest two years before an official diagnosis, according to a 2016 study from Duke University.\n\nKeller said pediatric providers, educational staff, and families need to know how to recognize and identify signs of poor mental health in kids.\n\n\u201cWe lack proactive support for mental health to support parents, because these are largely pediatric illnesses,\u201d Keller said. \u201cParents and caregivers really need to be our focus.\u201d\n\nTo improve pediatric mental health diagnostics and care, Texas launched the Child Psychiatry Access Network (CPAN) in 2020.\n\nCPAN is a hotline for pediatricians and other health providers treating children to consult with mental health experts to identify the best courses of treatment for their patients.\n\nKeller encourages people to start a conversation with a loved one about how they\u2019re feeling and seek help if they\u2019re not sure what to do.\n\n\u201cThese are sensitive, difficult issues to talk about, and so have someone help you with that,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are medical illnesses.

Check out our story calendar for more.\n\nWhen Josette Saxton was in high school, she wrote an essay about child abuse that was a red flag for a teacher who reached out to offer her help.\n\n\u201cI was just being creative,\u201d said Saxton, who is now a mental health policy associate for Texans Care for Children. \u201cBut what if I was someone who was feeling alone and it was a cry for help?\u201d\n\nStarting Sept. 1, more Texas teachers will be trained to offer the kind of intervention Saxton\u2019s teacher did when it is needed. Senate Bill 460, by state Sen. Robert Deuell, R-Greenville, will implement new requirements for mental health intervention strategies in schools that are intended to help teachers reach out to students who show signs of mental or emotional distress.\n\nUntil recently, talk about mental health policy in Texas was focused on treating serious mental health disorders rather than on assessing disorders before they escalate without treatment, Saxton said.\n\nAbout 288,000 children live with serious mental health conditions in Texas, according to 2010 figures from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. And those students, according to the Alliance, are more likely to drop out of school.\n\nHoping to prevent many of those students from dropping out, Texans Care for Children and a coalition of other groups that promote mental health and disability awareness, including the Texas Council for Developmental Disabilities and Mental Health America for Greater Houston, urged legislators this year to consider the need for positive intervention programs and for training educators.\n\nUnder the new law, school districts will be required to provide teachers, administrators and staff with training on mental health intervention and suicide prevention to help them identify red flags in a child\u2019s behavior and respond effectively.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for schools to diagnose or treat kids,\u201d Saxton said. The law, she added, is \u201ca good starting place to increase a school\u2019s ability to do a better job of recognizing when a child is having serious mental concerns and then knowing how they can respond in a way that won\u2019t make it harder for students.\u201d\n\nThe one-time training sessions could be implemented as soon as the upcoming school year.\n\nThe new training requirements will also lead to changes in the college curriculum for aspiring teachers at Texas universities. College students will receive instruction in the detection of mental or emotional disorders before receiving their diplomas.\n\nBehavioral management courses are already offered in education programs at several universities, but they are usually limited to students majoring in special education, said DeAnn Lechtenberger, director of technical assistance and community outreach at Texas Tech University\u2019s Burkhart Center for Autism Education and Research.\n\nUniversities\u2019 efforts to create additional behavioral management courses for students in general education programs will push the two disciplines to work collaboratively, Lechtenberger said.\n\nThe specialized behavioral management courses and training will fall under Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS, a program promoted by a federal special education technical assistance center.\n\nSupporters of the new law also hope the new training will reduce the segregation in classrooms of children with behavioral issues, including mental and emotional disorders.\n\nIf teachers are trained to implement methods of intervention that create a suitable learning environment for all students, they hope that students with behavioral disorders will be able to stay in regular classrooms.\n\n\u201cOur goal is that every child is served with a regular curriculum,\u201d said Belinda Carlton, public policy specialist for the Texas Council on Developmental Disabilities.\n\nCarlton said she hopes PBIS training at the college level will change educators\u2019 philosophy \u201cfrom the ground up,\u201d starting with new teachers.\n\n\u201cEven if we can\u2019t educate every educator already in public schools, if every future educator has the training, we see this impacting on a system-wide level for the future,\u201d Carlton said.\n\nQuick Facts about Children and Mental Health in Texas\n\nTEXAS RANKS 49th among the states in per-capita mental health spending\n\nCHILDREN WITH MENTAL ILLNESS Estimated1,200,000 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Diagnosed288,000 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u25a0\n\nSTUDENTS QUALIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES Nearly three-quarters of students in Texas public schools were suspended or expelled at least once from 1999 to 2009.\n\nSCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES STAFF About 1 in 4 health services staff reported lacking training or support they needed to effectively address students' behavioral health in 2008.\n\nSPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS Nearly 1 in 3 special education teachers reported they do not have the training, support or supervision necessary to handle students' behavioral health issues in 2008.", "source_domain": "www.texastribune.org", "article_id": "ae7bd633-d2c6-4801-8d1a-7d562857aa44", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

As our legislators consider options to reorganize the state\u2019s health and human services agencies, the job will be incomplete unless they also address the critical workforce shortage for behavioral health professionals \u2013 a shortage that we at the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute consider a public health emergency.\n\nWe know the impact that mental health disorders have on the people and financial resources of our state. Our own surveys have found that 76 percent of Texans have a close friend or family member who has experienced a mental health need. Approximately 50 percent of all mental health disorders begin by age 14, affecting one-in-five Texas children in a given year and nearly half of Texans across their lifetime.\n\nA significant challenge in getting care to everyone who needs it is that the majority of Texas mental health providers are clustered in just five counties: Bexar, Dallas, Harris, Tarrant and Travis. Of Texas\u2019 254 counties, 207 are designated as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, and 241 counties have some level of shortage of behavioral health professionals. The most drastic shortages are in non-metropolitan areas, including East Texas, West Texas, the Panhandle, the Rio Grande Valley, and El Paso.\n\nThere are also wide gaps for different types of providers. Texas is the second most populous state with several of the fastest-growing communities in the nation. Yet the overall number of behavioral health professionals falls far short compared to national averages. Texas has 76 psychologists per 100,000 residents, compared to the national average of 129. Similarly, Texas has 253 licensed social workers per 100,000 residents, compared to a national average of 402. The shortages are similarly acute for psychologists, licensed professional counselors, and licensed marriage and family therapists. The shortages grow even more acute when it comes to specialists for children, older adults, minority communities, and people who do not speak English as their first language.\n\nTo improve the wellness of Texans, an adequate and comprehensive workforce of skilled behavioral health professionals is essential. A key strategy to help bridge the gaps in both geographic coverage and provider type will be to rethink education and training for physicians and other health care professionals, as well as incentivizing practitioners who are in scarce supply to relocate and practice in Texas. Texas ranks 31st in the nation for psychiatric residency slots on a per capital basis, and is one of eight states that does not offer reciprocity or endorsement of physicians\u2019 licenses from other states.\n\nThere are several bills before the Texas legislature offering potential solutions. HB 2434 and SB 239 seek to provide assistance with student loan repayment for mental health professionals that commit to practice in underserved regions of Texas. SB18 expands graduate medical education capacity in Texas. HB 661 and SB 190 would authorize participation by Texas in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact for eligible physicians who voluntarily elect to participate.\n\nThe costs of mental health disorders on Texans and their families and for Texas taxpayers are too high to ignore.

Charlie Health's announcement marks a new, comprehensive mental health treatment option for youth and families in Texas.\n\nCharlie Health is the first-ever virtual mental health clinic to provide access to care for millions of teens, young adults, and families experiencing mental health crises. By partnering with community stakeholders, hospitals, insurance companies, schools, and local therapists, Charlie Health provides individualized treatment for patients who require more than weekly individual therapy or who are transitioning back to home and school after residential or hospital-based treatment.\n\nThe need for accessible mental health care is particularly urgent for youth in Texas: suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth ages 10-24. \"As a native Texan, I've seen firsthand how devastating the lack of mental health resources is here,\" said Amber Buchanan, Charlie Health's Director of Outreach in Texas. \"Research on rural mental health has found that 97% of Texans live in an area where there's a shortage of mental health providers. Charlie Health immediately meets the needs of teens, young adults, and families who are seeking care where they are.\"\n\nSince its initial launch in Montana in September 2020, Charlie Health has expanded services to states across the country. With its launch in Texas\u2013\u2013where a quarter of the population is under 18\u2013\u2013the company aims to tackle the three main obstacles to mental health care: access, availability, and acceptability. To lower these barriers, the company leverages evidence-based care with accessible, video-based therapy to serve as many high-acuity patients as possible. Rather than group patients together based on their physical location, the company customizes treatment plans by carefully matching patients in groups of peers navigating similar experiences. Patients are also assigned to expert licensed therapists who specialize in their specific needs. Charlie Health believes in the power of healing from home, alongside the patient's support system to ensure a successful and sustainable treatment experience.\n\n\"The fact that Texas' rates of youth depression are higher than the national average and that most of these same young people are living without appropriate support...it's more than tragic. It's unacceptable,\" said Geanne Weaver-Hepler, Director of Outreach at Charlie Health. \"Charlie Health fills a critical gap in the mental health care continuum, and I am thrilled to share its urgently-needed services with our communities in Texas.\"\n\nAbout Charlie Health\n\nCharlie Health, founded in 2020, is the first-ever virtual mental health clinic for high-acuity patients, enabling increased access to care for millions. Charlie Health provides teens and young adults struggling with mental health and substance use disorders personalized Intensive Outpatient (IOP) treatment programs which consist of group therapy, individual therapy, family therapy, and psychiatric support. By providing quality, accessible behavioral health support, Charlie Health ensures that sustainable healing is available to all.

For resources and support, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, or text HOME to 741741 to connect to the Crisis Text Line.\n\nA new initiative from Children\u2019s Health and Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute has in its first year expanded mental health services to more than 150,000 families in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nThe pediatric mental health initiative launched in 2022 to train primary care doctors to assess anxiety, depression and stress in the kids they treat.\n\nSabrina Browne, an assistant professor of psychiatry at UT Southwestern who also works in the behavioral health program at Children\u2019s Health, headed up the initiative.\n\n\u201cPediatricians and others in pediatric primary care are in such a great position to have those conversations with families and de-stigmatize mental health,\u201d Browne said. \u201cThis is something we want to address as part of your everyday healthcare.\u201d\n\nThe catalyst for this pediatric consultation model was in 2020, with the state\u2019s Child Psychiatric Access Network (CPAN). Browne answered questions from doctors all over Texas who were looking for help diagnosing, treating and referring patients to psychiatry and psychology services.\n\n\u201cWe had an epidemic in children\u2019s mental health before the pandemic, but once the pandemic hit, it just really opened up the floodgates,\u201d Browne said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough child psychiatrists out there.\u201d\n\nLack of mental health care services in Texas\n\nThe nonprofit Mental Health America ranks Texas among the 11 states in the country where youth have higher rates of mental health issues and less access to care.\n\nAccording to data from the federal Health Resources & Services Administration, more than 130 of Texas\u2019 254 counties are designated as mental health professional shortage areas. That means people in more than 50% of Texas counties may not be able to find a mental health care provider when they need it.\n\nAnd Browne said mental health issues have been building for kids since 2020. According to reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emergency department visits \u201cincreased for self-harm, drug poisoning, and psychosocial concerns\u201d for kids ages 5-17 throughout the pandemic, in comparison to 2019.\n\nTeen girls were especially impacted: They had emergency visits for suicide attempts 50% more in 2021 than in the same time period in 2019.\n\nChildren's Health Sabrina Browne and Mia Best have both trained about 75 pediatric health professionals to discuss and detect mental health issues in their patients. \"We really focus on early intervention and prevention,\" Browne said. \"We really want to catch kids before they end up in a crisis. We're hearing that our providers are feeling more comfortable to start addressing some of these issues. It's been really exciting.\"\n\nOver the past year, Browne and her colleague, Children\u2019s Health pediatrician Mia Best, have trained 75 health professionals in Dallas-Fort Worth through online modules and in-person case study discussions.\n\n\u201cOne of my passions and main goals with this initiative is bringing mental health back into the idea of overall health and wellbeing,\u201d Browne said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a disservice in trying to separate out physical from mental health, because the two are so intertwined.\u201d\n\nBest said she knows how overwhelmed pediatricians can get, and how important it is to carve out a space for learning, growth and community-building.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really talking about children\u2019s lives and their emotions,\u201d Best said. \u201cWe also are going through things ourselves as providers. It\u2019s really hard because we put our heart and soul into treating these kids and making sure their lives are better. When sometimes it doesn\u2019t go as planned, how are we coping with that?\u201d\n\nBest said integrating care helps providers, patients, and patient\u2019s families, especially when treating issues of generational trauma and social determinants of health.\n\nBoth she and Browne are recruiting more health providers to participate in the initiative, which runs quarterly, and hope to expand the program beyond Dallas-Fort Worth in the coming years.\n\nGot a tip?

Will he do it again?\n\nThe president-elect previously supported community mental health programs in Texas, the 988 hotline and addressed the opioid crisis, but his plan to address homelessness threatens that legacy.\n\nBY STEPHEN SIMPSON\nNOV. 20, 2024\n5 AM CENTRAL\nSHARE\nREPUBLISH\nFormer U.S. President and 2024 presidential hopeful Donald Trump speaks at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference meeting on Feb. 24, 2024 in National Harbor, Maryland. \nCredit:\n Zach Roberts/NurPhoto via REUTERS\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nLaw and order. This motto is the paramount stance of President-elect Donald Trump when it comes to mental health and substance abuse issues.\n\nThe president-elect campaigned on promises to shake up public health institutions, reshape federal health programs, and slash high costs across the health system. Trump has also said he\u2019s ready for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to \u201cgo wild\u201d on health, medicine, and food policy. But what exactly does this mean for mental health, and what does it mean specifically for Texas?\n\nSome Texas mental health and substance abuse experts say it can be a mixed bag when it comes to this topic, as the previous Trump administration made groundbreaking advances in mental health and substance use programs, funded in large part by COVID-19 relief dollars that are set to expire soon. But more recently, Trump has spoken very little about his upcoming plans for mental health and substance use beyond fielding an idea about creating federally-funded homeless camps, diverting more people into mental health institutions and ending urban camping, the latter of which has gained traction in Texas.\n\nFor the most part, mental health and substance has found bipartisan support, but whether lawmakers can find common ground in a divisive political climate under Trump is uncertain.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cIn President Trump\u2019s first term, he did a few things that were actually very beneficial for mental health in general,\u201d said Dr. Octavio Martinez, the executive director of the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cNow the question is going to be, that was then \u2014 will those dollars continue under his second term, as a lot of those dollars are about to end next year? If those dollars expire, then we could see a significant impact on the state\u2019s mental health programs.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s track record\n\nThere is a sense of cautious hopefulness around Trump\u2019s second term after he signed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that provided $8 billion to Texas.\n\nThis funded many innovative mental health efforts in Texas, including telepsychiatry programs in schools and libraries, community mental health programs in churches, and peer-to-peer services where mental wellness can be practiced in the community without a degree.\n\nThe Trump administration also oversaw the creation of the 988 crisis hotline in 2020. Staffed 24/7, the hotline connects people experiencing mental health distress with trained counselors.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\u201cMany advocates in mental health had asked for it for many years, and it finally happened under Trump. It was a huge advancement in connecting people with crisis services,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nHowever, implementing the 988 program has been difficult in Texas, especially in the rural areas, as staffing these call centers has been problematic.\n\n\u201cHopefully, he will want to enhance the 988 program because that is one of the legacies of his first term,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt allowed for a more humanistic approach to a crisis.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to substance use and treatment funding, Trump has been a strong advocate of addressing the opioid crisis, calling it a national public health emergency and handing out nearly $2 billion in grants in his last term. Texas received $27 million, which has been used to create fentanyl campaigns and get anti-overdose medication in schools, bars, churches, and more.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBut, throw in the potential appointment of Kennedy as the U.S. health secretary, progress seen in Trump\u2019s first term could unravel.\n\nKennedy has been outspoken about providing more resources for substance use treatment but is critical of medication treatments for mental health conditions. Kennedy, earlier this year, made a series of controversial statements about health care, including that there could be a damaging link between antidepressants and school shootings and the benefits of legalizing psychedelics for mental health treatment.\n\n\u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats in Congress have supported increases in substance use funding in recent years, and an optimistic view is that the current level of funding support will continue or increase,\u201d said Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nChallenges that face the new administration\u00a0\n\nThe mental health and substance abuse field faces many issues, including a workforce shortage and a lack of diversity in the face of growing demand. However, the biggest challenge the Trump administration might face is replacing the COVID-19 relief funding which ends in 2024.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Texas Legislative Budget Board estimates the state has received more than $86.1 billion from six funding bills between 2020 and 2021. A significant chunk of the money was spent on mental health resources.\n\nFor example, Texas schools received more than $19 billion from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund and a statewide survey showed more than 73% of school districts reported using those funds for mental health.\n\n\u201cMuch of our mental health approach in Texas has been built on this funding,\u201d said Martinez. \u201cThe politicization of COVID and the pushback against vaccines in general makes you question if there will be ongoing support for those dollars we got during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAnother issue facing pro-business Trump is forcing health insurance companies to cover mental health and substance use disorders the same way it covers medical and surgical conditions.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nIn Texas, nearly 1 in 5 youth with private health insurance don\u2019t have coverage for mental or emotional problems, and roughly one-third of adults who have a mental health disorder are not able to see a doctor due to cost, according to Forbes.\n\n\u201cWe have to ensure physical and mental health are seen equally in the eyes of insurance companies,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nWhat has Trump proposed so far?\u00a0\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed one plan to address mental illness and substance use across the country already \u2014 federally-funded homeless camps.\n\n\u201cWe are making the many suffer for the whims of a deeply unwell few,\u201d Trump said in a video on his campaign website.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTrump wants to buy large parcels of inexpensive land for tent cities, bringing in doctors, psychiatrists, social workers and drug rehab specialists to treat individuals there.\n\nThis controversial concept has alarmed mental health experts who say sequestering those experiencing homelessness is a return to institutionalizing the mentally ill. This movement started to end in the 1980s with the decline of state mental health hospitals.\n\nMartinez said studies have found forcing people into mental health treatment usually doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a law and order approach is concerning when it comes to homelessness,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe have some great diversion programs established that use a health care approach. It\u2019s less expensive than the criminal justice system, which we have tried to use to address this in the past.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTrump\u2019s desire to use more mental institutions to house and rehabilitate those with severe mental illness jibes with a critical piece of Texas\u2019 mental health plans for the future.\n\nEarlier this year, Gov. Greg Abbott announced seven new state hospital projects funded by $1.5 billion legislators approved in 2023 to expand, renovate and build new facilities across the state.\n\nAlso possibly currying favor among Texas lawmakers is Trump\u2019s ban on urban camping.\n\nBans on homeless encampments in Texas drew backing of the U.S. Supreme Court in a sweeping ruling earlier this year, allowing cities and states to fine people experiencing homelessness for sleeping in public places amid record-high homelessness levels.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nCamping bans adopted by state lawmakers and in major cities like Austin and Houston weren\u2019t explicitly challenged in the case. But advocates for those experiencing homelessness saw the ruling as a signal to state and local governments to embrace such policies without providing housing options for people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe number of Texans experiencing homelessness returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, growing by more than 12% in 2023. Some 27,000 Texans were homeless last year, according to federal estimates.\n\nIn addition to his homelessness proposals, his substance use strategy intersects with border security, which experts say is not effective.\n\n\u201cTighter border security and mass deportations will not reduce the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the president-elect may still point to tactics like these as evidence that he is addressing the epidemic,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nIf Trump does nothing more than maintain the same amount of effort he put into addressing substance use, it will be a win for the mental health community, she said.\n\nPlus, many of the problems in mental health and substance use must be addressed locally anyway.\n\n\u201cLong-term reductions in substance misuse and related harms require a genuine commitment to addressing the country's epidemics of poverty and social isolation,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the next four years, I hope to see more local and state efforts to tackle these problems.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Hogg Foundation for Mental Health and Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

On Saturday, September 7, 2019 more than 65 HCA Healthcare facilities will partner with local law enforcement agencies to collect unused and expired prescription medications in 15 states.\n\nWith over 38,000 employed and affiliated physicians at its 184 hospitals and approximately 2,000 sites of care, HCA Healthcare is helping to combat the opioid epidemic by ensuring patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment, raising awareness about the dangers of opioid addiction and providing proper disposal of these medications.\n\n\u201cWe are working to create healthier communities by partnering with our colleagues, patients and neighbors and engaging on important healthcare issues such as this one,\u201d said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of The HCA Healthcare Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe abuse of prescription drugs too often starts when family or friends obtain medications from home medicine cabinets,\u201d adds Pulles. \u201cWe urge people to take three simple steps: clean out your medicine cabinet, collect medications that are no longer needed and safely dispose of them at one of our \u2018Crush the Crisis\u2019 take back locations.\u201d\n\nIn addition to \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d events on September 7, more than 20 HCA Healthcare hospitals will host events later this year. In total, approximately 90 HCA Healthcare hospitals will participate. For a complete list of \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d collection sites, click here.\n\nBreaking down the opioid crisis: Every day, more than Every day, more than 130 people in the United States die of opioid overdose. In 2017 alone, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. The numbers are astronomical, enough for the President to declare opioids a public health emergency . The brunt of the epidemic is not just felt by those who succumb to opiates, but also by family, friends and the communities that HCA Healthcare serves.\n\nThe importance of take back events\n\nFacilities across the HCA Healthcare network lie in states heavily impacted by the opioid crisis. Caregivers know the scourge of opioid misuse, addiction and overdose. \u201cEvery day, hospitals across the country treat patients for opioid overdose in emergency rooms,\u201d said Dr. Michael Schlosser, vice president of clinical excellence and surgical services at HCA Healthcare.\n\n\u201cTake back events are vital to helping prevent drug overdose, controlling illicit drug use and curbing our nation\u2019s opioid crisis,\u201d says Schlosser.\n\nMore than half of people who misuse opioid medications report:\n\nObtaining them for free or stealing them from someone they know\n\nGoing to multiple doctors to get additional prescriptions\n\nFilling prescriptions at different pharmacies so that no one will notice how many pills they get each month\n\nTeens hold a common misperception that prescription drugs are less harmful than other drugs; in the past year, two-thirds of teens who misused pain relievers reported that they got them from family, friends and the home medicine cabinet.\n\nEven our littlest patients are affected. Every minute of every day, a poison control center answers a call about a young child who has accidentally ingested a medication.\n\nThe safest and most responsible option to dispose of medication is to take unwanted medications to a drug take back site or event. Unused opioids thrown in the trash can be retrieved and abused or sold illegally. Flushing medications down the toilet pose a potentially health and environmental hazard.\n\nWhat HCA Healthcare is doing\n\n\u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d opioid take back events are just one spot, among many, in HCA Healthcare\u2019s dedication to curbing opioid misuse.\n\nWatch:\n\nHarnessing scale and resources\n\nIn 2018, HCA Healthcare\u2019s TriStar Health Division, headquartered in Nashville, hosted the first \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d event. More than 224 pounds of medication, equivalent to over 100,000 doses, were anonymously collected across eight hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe were excited about the success of our TriStar Health Division\u2019s take back day last year and knew that with HCA Healthcare\u2019s scale, we could make an even greater impact by expanding this program to more of the communities we serve,\u201d said Dr. Schlosser.\n\nIn addition to \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d take back events, approximately 11 HCA Healthcare affiliated hospitals nationwide will launch permanent medication collection boxes.\n\nPartnership is key\n\nHCA Healthcare proudly partners with the National Academy of Medicine (NAM)\u2019s Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic, consisting of more than 50 organizations that share best practices and identify gaps in the safe treatment of opioid addiction.\n\nHCA Healthcare has committed $500,000 to the Collaborative to support development of safer pain management protocols and reversal of the opioid crisis.\n\nNAM president, Dr. Victor Dzau, Assistant HHS Secretary Dr. Brett Giroir, Dr. Ruth Katz and HCA Healthcare\u2019s president of clinical services and chief medical officer, Dr. Jonathan Perlin, serve as co-chairs for the Collaborative to combat over-prescription of opioids, improve provider education, and address under-treatment of opioid use disorders.\n\nDr. Mike Schlosser serves on the NAM \u201cOpioid Prescribing Guidelines and Evidence Standards\u201d committee, which is synthesizing evidence-based practices, establishing a clearinghouse for best practices and identifying gaps in research for safe treatment of opioid addiction.\n\nNew strategies for pain management\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR)\n\nHCA Healthcare developed new strategies to manage pain for the 1.5 million patients that have surgery annually in an HCA Healthcare facility. HCA Healthcare\u2019s Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR) is an innovative surgical approach that uses evidence-based pre, intra, and post-operative interventions to optimize patient outcomes.\n\nESR, which features a multi-modal approach to pain management for patients, has demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and \u2013 importantly \u2013 a drastic reduction in the use for opioids.\n\nMulti-modal pain management, focuses on using two or more different methods or medications to manage pain and reduces the need to use opioids to manage a patient\u2019s pain while recovering from surgery. This approach results in significantly decreased opioid use and opioid prescriptions.\n\nHCA Healthcare data from January 2018 through June 2019, collected from 47,400 major abdominal, joint, gynecologic oncology, spinal and bariatric ESR surgeries revealed an up to 50.4% decrease in opioid use for these patients.\n\nThe data, collected from 114 affiliate hospitals, was compared to a non-ESR protocol patient population undergoing the same surgery procedures in the same time period.\n\nAs of June 2019, ESR is live at 127 HCA Healthcare facilities, with the goal to implement in all facilities for at least one major service line by the end of 2019.\n\nALTernatives to Opioids in the Emergency Room (ALTO in the ER)\n\nWith ALTO in the ER, HCA Healthcare\u2019s goal is to manage painful conditions for emergency department patients and return them to a maximum quality of life, while recognizing and reducing the inherent risks of administering and prescribing highly addictive medications like opioids.\n\nIn 2017, affiliate Swedish Medical Center pioneered the first-of-its-kind strategy to curtail potential opioid misuse related to the use of opioids in the emergency department.\n\nWith the ALTO in the ER program, rather than using opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone or fentanyl, medications like ketamine and lidocaine are employed for frontline pain management.\n\nBecause of this emergency department initiative, patient opioid use at affiliate Swedish Medical Center from June \u2013 November of 2017 was reduced by 36%, compared to data from a non-ALTO patient population over the same time period in 2016.\n\nHCA Healthcare plans to expand the ALTO in the ER protocols enterprise-wide in 2019.\n\nElectronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS)\n\nElectronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS) aims to stem increasing rates of opioid-related addiction, misuse diversion and death by making it more difficult for medication-seekers to doctor-shop and alter prescriptions. Physicians have access to aggregated electronic health record (EHR) data that will help them to prescribe opioids judiciously.\n\nECPS allows clinicians to see patients\u2019 medication histories at the point of care, which helps identify patients who may be exhibiting behaviors associated with drug misuse. ECPS also ensures that prescriptions are securely transmitted from clinician to pharmacy without risk for forgery or alteration. As of June 2019, more than 2,800 physicians across HCA Healthcare have EPCS.\n\nJoin the action by finding a \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d collection take back site near you by visiting HCAhealthcare.com/CrushTheCrisis.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "7d7593de-3fa6-489b-802d-bc27988b3920", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nAs fentanyl overdoses continue to soar in Colorado, a new medication assisted treatment facility in Aurora is hoping to lower barriers to treatment for people struggling with opioid addiction.\n\nCommunity Medical Services opened its intake facility in Aurora Oct. 28, and is the city\u2019s first opioid outpatient center. It will offer medication assisted treatment and counseling, 15 hours a day, seven days a week to people seeking help for addiction.\n\nBased in Arizona, CMS has over 50 facilities in 10 states. This is its first location in Colorado, but it hopes to open about half a dozen more over the next several years, program manager Christina Boudreaux told The Sentinel. The company was drawn to Colorado due to what she described as an overwhelming need for more addiction services.\n\n\u201cWhen we were looking at the overdose rates, Colorado is so incredibly underserved, and so when we saw the opportunity to make an impact we jumped on it,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to data compiled by the clinic using 2020 numbers, Boudreaux said that in Colorado four people die every day from an opioid overdose death, a rate that she believes is an undercount from the current situation.\n\nSimilar to states across the country, Colorado has been grappling for years with a rise in overdose deaths. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported that 1,881 people died from a drug overdose in 2021, and the age-adjusted rate of fatal overdoses was 31.7 per 100,000 residents, up from 1,477 deaths and a rate of 24.9 the previous year.\n\nOutreach Lead, Patrick Sullivan, reflects back on how Community Medical Services was able to help him get past his heroin addiction, Oct. 26, at the new CMS facility in Aurora.\n\nPhoto by PHILIP B. POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nFentanyl, an ultra-powerful synthetic opioid, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, has been driving many of the deaths, according to state and federal health officials.\n\nThe federal government counted more accidental overdose deaths in 2021 alone than it did in the 20-year period from 1979 through 1998. Overdoses in recent years have been many times more frequent than they were during the black tar heroin epidemic that led President Richard Nixon to launch his War on Drugs, or during the cocaine crisis in the 1980s.\n\nAs fentanyl gains attention, mistaken beliefs persist about the drug, how it is trafficked and why so many people are dying.\n\nExperts believe deaths surged not only because the drugs are so powerful, but also because fentanyl is laced into so many other illicit drugs, and not because of changes in how many people are using. In the late 2010s \u2014 the most recent period for which federal data is available \u2014 deaths were skyrocketing even as the number of people using opioids was dropping.\n\nAdvocates warn that some of the alarms being sounded by politicians and officials are wrong and potentially dangerous. Among those ideas: that tightening control of the U.S.-Mexico border would stop the flow of the drugs, though experts say the key to reining in the crisis is reducing drug demand; that fentanyl might turn up in kids\u2019 trick-or-treat baskets this Halloween; and that merely touching the drug briefly can be fatal \u2014 something that researchers found untrue and that advocates worry can make first responders hesitate about giving lifesaving treatment.\n\nAll three ideas were brought up this month in an online video billed as a pre-Halloween public service announcement from a dozen Republican U.S. senators.\n\nA report this year from a bipartisan federal commission found that fentanyl and similar drugs are being made mostly in labs in Mexico from chemicals shipped primarily from China.\n\nWith such a deadly drug flooding the streets, providers at CMS say their mission is more important than ever.\n\nMedication assisted treatment, commonly abbreviated as MAT, involves treating people addicted to opioids with a substance that inhibits their ability to get high off of opioids and that decreases their craving for the drug. The clinic offers both methadone and suboxone, which must be taken every day in liquid form, as well as vivitrol, an injectable drug administered every 28 days.\n\nLocated at 14300 E. Exposition Ave., a short walk from the Aurora Metro Center Station and the Town Center of Aurora, the new facility is specifically designed to be as accessible as possible. It is open from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, operates on a walk-in basis and has a goal of having wait times of no longer than five minutes.\n\nThat makes it unique for MAT facilities, which often are only open in the early morning until around noon and don\u2019t process people for initial intake appointments every day, Boudreaux said. With a medicine that needs to be taken every day to be effective, that can make things difficult for patients, many of whom don\u2019t have their own cars or work irregular hours.\n\n\u201cThe thought is, the second someone\u2019s ready for treatment, they can come in,\u201d she said. There are eight rooms at the new Community Medical Services location in Aurora.\n\nPhoto by PHILIP B. POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nUnlike some other programs, the clinic is also unique in that it will not stop treating patients if they continue to test positive for drugs, and will only kick patients out if they are aggressive or violent. From a public health perspective, Boudreaux said it doesn\u2019t make sense to cut off people\u2019s access to treatment when they are struggling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no treatment if they die,\u201d she said.\n\nThe clinic currently has 13 staff members, and the methadone and suboxone, which are highly regulated, will be administered by licensed nurses at several window kiosks. Past the kiosks are a series of rooms that will be used for one-on-one counseling sessions for patients.\n\nThe rooms are brightly decorated, and the reception area has floor-to-ceiling windows. Michele Ryan, community programs and integrations manager for CMS, said the clinic was designed to look as much like a normal doctor\u2019s office as possible. A big part of CMS\u2019 mission is to reduce the stigma associated with receiving treatment for addiction.\n\n\u201cOur clients are so judged in the rest of the world, when they come here we want that to be a respite from that,\u201d she said.\n\nNoise machines are placed outside of each of the eight therapy rooms that are located at the new Community Medical Services facility in Aurora. The sound machines are there to ensure privacy when meeting with a counselor.\n\nPhoto by PHILIP B. POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nThe counselors will also provide case management services for patients, and will try to connect them with other services they need to try and deal with their addiction.\n\n\u201cWe always try to have an answer to any barrier someone has,\u201d said Patrick Sullivan, CMS\u2019 outreach lead for the new clinic.\n\nSullivan is no stranger to the efficacy of MAT. In college in the late 1990s he started using heroin and illicit prescription opioids and ultimately became an everyday user dependent on the drug to function and not become sick.\n\n\u201cMy normal was I had to have the drugs in my system,\u201d he said.\n\nHe ultimately decided that he needed help, but was living in a rural part of Illinois where resources were scarce. He ended up moving to Tucson and started receiving treatment at a CMS clinic. It took about two months on methadone before he stopped using opioids, he said, but he ultimately quit completely and has been clean ever since.\n\nBeing on treatment that took away his craving for the drug and allowed him to focus on changing other conditions of his life instead of being trapped in a cycle of constantly trying to make enough money to get high so he didn\u2019t become dopesick.\n\nHe was on methadone for a total of three years. After about two years he decided he wanted to start planning to quit, and worked with a doctor to taper off the medication over the course of 10 months.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the life I have without it,\u201d he said of the treatment.\n\nSullivan has now worked with CMS for five and a half years, and said his personal experience with addiction and recovery has been a benefit when working with patients and potential community partners. The company does a lot of outreach to local jails and hospital systems to try to streamline access to treatment for addicts, and he said being able to address people\u2019s questions or concerns about MAT with firsthand knowledge is reassuring.\n\nOver time he said he\u2019s seen an increase in the acceptance of MAT, which was initially met with trepidation from some corners due. He worked for a number of years with patients who were in the criminal justice system, and said that the willingness of sheriffs and judges to allow people to receive MAT has increased over time.\n\n\u201cI would talk to police officers who started telling me, \u2018we can\u2019t arrest our way out of this problem,\u2019 and they\u2019re out there on the front lines arresting people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis undated file photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Los Angeles Field Division, shows some of the seized approximately 1 million fake pills containing fentanyl that were seized when agents served a search warrant, July 5, 2022, at a home in Inglewood, Calif. Heading into key elections, there have been assertions that the drug might be handed out like Halloween candy, something the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s head has said isn\u2019t true. And some candidates for elected office frame the crisis as mostly a border-control issue, though experts say the key to reining in the crisis is reducing demand for the drugs. (Drug Enforcement Administration via AP, File) This undated file photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Los Angeles Field Division, shows some of the seized approximately 1 million fake pills containing fentanyl that were seized when agents served a search warrant, July 5, 2022, at a home in Inglewood, Calif.

(Drug Enforcement Administration via AP, File)\n\nThat sentiment was repeated at a community event organized by Aurora Public Schools over the weekend, where local law enforcement and public health officials raised the red flag about the dangers of fentanyl.\n\nProsecutors in the 17th and 18th Judicial Districts, which encompass Adams and Arapahoe counties, said that fentanyl has completely infected the local drug supply. Fentanyl is easier to manufacture than other drugs and is highly addictive, which incentivizes drug dealers to add it to their supply.\n\n\u201cNo drug is safe right now,\u201d said 17th Judicial District Attorney Brian Mason. \u201cDo not take any pill unless you know where it\u2019s from and it came from a pharmacy.\u201d\n\nThe department has found fentanyl in everything from meth and heroin to cocaine, he said. Darcy Kofol, who prosecutes drug crimes in the 18th Judicial District, said that fentanyl has completely replaced the supply of illicit oxycodone that used to be on the streets.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has warned that fentanyl is being sold in multicolored pills and powders \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201crainbow fentanyl\u201d \u2014 marketed on social media to teens and young adults. However, experts say fears of fentanyl being marketed to young children are unfounded.\n\nJoel Best, an emeritus sociology professor at the University of Delaware, said that idea falls in with a long line of Halloween-related scares. He has examined cases since 1958 and has not found a single instance of a child dying because of something foreign put into Halloween candy \u2014 and few instances of that being done at all.\n\n\u201cIf you give a dose of fentanyl to kids in elementary school, you have an excellent chance of killing them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do addict them, what are you going to do, try to take their lunch money? No one is trying to addict little kids to fentanyl.\u201d\n\n(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nMany times, people overdose because they take a pill that they think is an opioid or another prescription drug but is actually fentanyl, Kofol said. Without people knowing exactly what substances they\u2019re ingesting, it\u2019s incredibly easy to take a fatal dose by accident.\n\n\u201cEach of these pills are essentially Russian roulette with an overdose,\u201d she said.\n\nKofol referenced a 2020 case where a 16-year-old girl died of an overdose after being given fentanyl by an adult man at a party. Kofol said the girl thought she was taking an oxycodone pill. The man was sentenced to 64 years in prison this summer.\n\n\u201cTeens are allowed to make mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem with fentanyl is it doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAt the Aurora Public Schools event, employees from the Tri-County Health Department handed out narcan, a drug that can be used to safely reverse opioid overdoses, as well as fentanyl testing strips that can be used to determine whether fentanyl is present in another substance.\n\nThe best thing people can do to help prevent overdose deaths is to be aware of the dangers of fentanyl and to talk to their children and friends about it, Mason said. He feels better when people who sell deadly drugs are put behind bars, but said that by itself incarceration won\u2019t be enough to solve the problem \u2014 and it can\u2019t bring someone back to life who has already died of an overdose.\n\n\u201cPrevention is better than prosecution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report", "source_domain": "sentinelcolorado.com", "article_id": "e9baf18c-9b4a-485d-a650-0481767869dc", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Every day, on average, 130 Americans die from opioid overdose. In 2017, an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers. To reverse the trajectory of this epidemic, leveraging data collected from more than 31 million annual patient encounters, HCA Healthcare healthcare has:\n\nDeveloped cutting-edge pain treatment protocols\n\nPromoted enhanced surgical recovery programs\n\nLaunched national \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d opioid take back events\n\nDeployed prescription monitoring and reporting programs\n\nLeveraging prescribing data\n\nDr. Christopher Ott, chief medical officer at HCA Healthcare\u2019s Physician Services Group (PSG)\n\n\u201cHCA Healthcare has made tremendous advances in how we use data collected from our network of hospitals and clinics to improve patient care,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Ott, chief medical officer at HCA Healthcare\u2019s Physician Services Group (PSG).\n\nHCA Healthcare has employed our internally developed data, reporting and vendor information technology (IT) platforms to aid us in these efforts. In 2014, a multidisciplinary team began extracting prescribing data from the company\u2019s electronic data warehouse (EDW) and ambulatory electronic health record (EHR) system to report on location, patient and provider specific prescribing data.\n\nDr. Carol White, director of pharmacy services and clinical therapeutics at HCA Healthcare\n\nDr. Carol White, director of pharmacy services and clinical therapeutics at HCA Healthcare, helped lead the initiative.\n\n\u201cIt was a major undertaking,\u201d Dr. White said. \u201cWe had to create an entire medication-specific reporting architecture within our enterprise data warehouse to house the data, develop algorithms for certain medications and calculations, and establish workflows for providers that streamlined their work, while capturing the data in a way that allowed us to utilize it more efficiently.\u201d\n\nUsing HCA Healthcare\u2019s in-house analytics, the team created a reporting dashboard to examine prescribing patterns across the organization. All of this aimed at improving the way opioids are prescribed and how data is shared with providers.\n\n\u201cThis kind of deep insight creates opportunities to empower the provider with their own data,\u201d Dr. White said. \u201cReal trends began emerging in less than one year,\u201d she added.\n\nElectronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances (EPCS)\n\nThe team implemented the dashboard in tandem with the launch of Electronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances (EPCS), which allows providers to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions to a pharmacy. EPCS provides accountability, security, and has been shown to dramatically reduce medication errors and fraud.\n\nPartnering with the National Academy of Medicine (NAM)\n\nHCA Healthcare also established new processes and standardized safeguards to protect providers, patients and communities. In July 2018, HCA Healthcare joined the National Academy of Medicine\u2019s Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic and provided $500,000 to help bolster the fight against the crisis.\n\nUsing data to develop new strategies for pain management\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR)\n\nHCA Healthcare developed new strategies to manage pain for the 1.5 million patients that have surgery annually in an HCA Healthcare facility.

These dollars will improve quality of care and provide access to life-saving treatment.\u201d said Dr. Potter, professor of psychiatry and vice dean for research in the Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be leading this movement to change how opioid use disorder is treated in Texas because we believe all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect as they navigate treatment options,\u201d she added.\n\nTxMOUD builds on the highly successful program, GetWaivered Texas, that Dr. Potter and her team developed to streamline the Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s waiver process for prescribing buprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication used to treat OUD. Prescribing buprenorphine requires a DEA X-waiver. With only 1,500 waivered providers in Texas when GetWaivered Texas started in March 2019, the program trained an additional 700 providers in the past year. Through TxMOUD, these providers are encouraged to join a statewide treatment network. Health care providers will have access to ongoing training and support, and communities will have expanded access to treatment. This addresses an issue that is particularly problematic for rural communities.\n\nResearch has shown that substance use disorders are a leading cause of disease and death in the U.S. and directly cause cancer, overdose death, psychiatric disorders and suicide. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioid overdose is the leading cause of accidental death, exceeding automobile crashes and \ufb01rearm fatalities. And a new study published Feb. 5 in the open access journal JAMA Network Open showed that buprenorphine and methadone to be the most successful treatments for patients with OUD.\n\nClinical trials have shown that buprenorphine can help manage withdrawal symptoms. About 50 percent of people with OUD who take buprenorphine can resume a normal life. The drug reduces opioid craving and relieves withdrawal symptoms, Dr. Potter explained. It also can be prescribed to be used at home, just like an antibiotic. Meanwhile, methadone is a highly regulated medication. To receive methadone, patients must go daily to a specialty clinic. TxMOUD will cover the cost of medication, including buprenorphine and naltrexone (two evidence-based treatments), and other treatment costs for those patients without the ability to pay for care.\n\n\u201cTxMOUD is a critically important initiative, given a recent comparative effectiveness study published in JAMA Network Open, which examined the effectiveness of different treatments for OUD. In this national study, only buprenorphine and methadone reduced overdose and opioid-related symptoms. Importantly, naltrexone inpatient treatment and behavioral interventions did not. This TxMOUD program aligns perfectly with state-of-the-art treatment of opioid use disorder for Texans. We are proud and honored to lead this movement to change how opioid use disorder is treated in Texas,\u201d Dr. Potter said.\n\nFor more information on TxMOUD initiatives, visit www.txmoud.org, email txmoud@uthscsa.edu, or call (210) 450-5370.\n\n###\n\nThe Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio is named for Texas philanthropists Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long.

By equipping pharmacists with the tools and resources they need, the PhARM-OUD Guideline aims to increase the availability of buprenorphine and ultimately improve health outcomes for individuals receiving treatment for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe new practice guideline for pharmacists will allow more life saving drugs like buprenorphine to be dispensed in community pharmacies Tyler Varisco, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health outcomes and policy at UH, spearheaded the project to develop pharmacy guidelines\n\nCurrently, only about half of U.S. pharmacies dispense buprenorphine, despite it being the only medication routinely provided by community pharmacists for OUD treatment.\n\nDeveloped through a collaborative effort with an expert panel that includes psychiatrists, psychiatric pharmacists, and representatives from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Community Pharmacists Association, the guideline reflects a comprehensive approach to pharmacy practice for patients with OUD. The American Society of Addiction Medicine, the American Pharmacists Association, the American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists, the American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists, and Vital Strategies, a leading global public health organization, have all indicated their support for the guidance.\n\nThe PhARM-OUD Guideline is available on the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy website. Varisco, along with Douglas Thornton and Matthew Wanat in the Prescription Drug Misuse Education and Research (PREMIER) Center at the University of Houston College of Pharmacy will work closely with the National Community Pharmacists Association to develop educational materials that facilitate the adoption of these critical recommendations in more than 61,000 community pharmacies across the country.\n\nThe project was funded by a two-year, $572,278 grant from the Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts and is part of a broader $2 million initiative by FORE, which has awarded $33.9 million to combat the opioid crisis since its founding in 2018.", "source_domain": "www.uh.edu", "article_id": "b1177bfd-aaf4-46ff-8e36-4a3ac069e563", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

I am so proud and thankful for the collaborative safety initiatives that our pharmacy teams lead every day.\u201d\n\nOne way that pharmacists continue to improve patient care is through antimicrobial stewardship, a coordinated program to promote appropriate antibiotic use. Pharmacists work closely with nurses, physicians and other colleagues to monitor use and provide recommendations to reduce inappropriate prescribing. This results in shorter hospital stays for our patients and safeguards our community from multidrug resistant organisms.\n\nAs medication experts, pharmacists also play a key role in combating the opioid crisis. HCA Healthcare pharmacists are armed with three types of technology to optimize clinician communication and to minimize opioid overuse and diversion:\n\nElectronic Prescription for Controlled Substances (EPCS) : EPCS allows providers to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions to a pharmacy.\n\n: EPCS allows providers to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions to a pharmacy. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) : PDMP allows providers and pharmacists to quickly perform medication history checks and monitor real-time controlled substance data, improving care and preventing patient harm.\n\n: PDMP allows providers and pharmacists to quickly perform medication history checks and monitor real-time controlled substance data, improving care and preventing patient harm. Medication Adherence and Compliance Index (MACI): Launched in the summer of 2020, MACI is an electronic platform that aggregates data to aid in the prevention of theft of dangerous controlled substances.\n\nAnnually, in coordination with local law enforcement and the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) national drug take back day, HCA Healthcare hosts national \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d opioid take back events. To raise awareness about the dangers of opioid misuse and proper disposal of medications, HCA Healthcare pharmacy professionals and other colleagues invite community members to safely and anonymously dispose of unused or expired medications. Last year, HCA Healthcare facilities collected 13,523 pounds of medication at the \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d events \u2013 an estimated 9.3 million doses.\n\nLearn more about this year\u2019s \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d events on Oct. 23 at hcahealthcare.com/crushthecrisis.\n\nMicheal P. Weishampel, a pharmacy technician at TriStar Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, compounds an IV medication for a patient.\n\nWorking together during COVID-19 and beyond\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, HCA Healthcare pharmacy colleagues worked to overcome logistical obstacles and develop strategies to store, administer and provide monoclonal antibody treatments and vaccinations to patients, care teams and community members. Sharing stories of success across HCA Healthcare facilities and divisions helped pharmacy teams expedite best practices for patients.\n\nWhile the roles of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians continues to evolve, HCA Healthcare remains committed to providing pharmacists with the tools and resources they need to deliver quality care and keep patients safe. Pharmacy residency programs at HCA Healthcare provide teaching and learning opportunities so pharmacists can maximize care delivery. These one- to two-year post-graduate education programs allow pharmacists to expand clinical knowledge, collaborate with healthcare teams and conduct research.\n\nMeet our pharmacy colleagues\n\nHCA Healthcare pharmacists are involved in nearly all aspects of patient care. In addition to medication therapy, pharmacists play a pivotal role in policy compliance, medication diversion, informatics and medication safety. Below, three HCA Healthcare pharmacy leaders share their career paths, day-to-day duties and how they\u2019re working to raise the bar for healthcare everywhere.\n\nDr. Ayoub Chybli, director of pharmacy, The Medical Center of Aurora (Aurora, Colorado)\n\nDr. Ayoub Chybli, director of pharmacy at The Medical Center of Aurora, reviews COVID-19 vaccines before delivery.\n\nDr. Ayoub Chybli manages complex multi-campus clinical operations with current oversight over acute care, behavioral health, rehabilitation and outpatient pharmacies. His interest in healthcare began during his undergraduate years when he realized pharmacy offered him an opportunity to combine his passion for serving the community and helping people get well. This led him to his current position at The Medical Center of Aurora, where he continues to incorporate those ideologies and collaborate across disciplines to build effective safety processes and ensure patients have high-quality outcomes.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, Dr. Chybli took on the historic and massive task of standing up vaccine clinics for colleagues and community members. With thoughtful and effective resourcing, staffing and teamwork, Dr. Chybli brought newfound hope to many through the vaccine clinics.\n\nFor his work in vaccine distribution, Dr. Chybli earned The Medical Center of Aurora\u2019s \u20182020 Leader of the Year Award.\u2019 The award honors those who demonstrate extraordinary leadership, devotion, expertise and support to those around them. For Dr. Chybli, the award \u201cmeans that I am surrounded by amazing leaders and colleagues that work tirelessly at the system, division and facility level. There are countless leaders that are more deserving of this award \u2013 I am happy to serve and honored to be recognized.\u201d\n\nDr. Luu Thuy, computer order entry pharmacist, Gulf Coast Division (Houston and South Texas)\n\nDr. Luu Thuy, computer order entry pharmacist, HCA Healthcare\u2019s Gulf Coast Division\n\nDr. Luu Thuy, PharmD, is a remote computer order entry (COE) pharmacist for HCA Healthcare\u2019s Gulf Coast Division in Texas. In her current role, Dr. Thuy works through a clinical surveillance platform to monitor, evaluate and make recommendations to assure the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals for patient care.\n\nDr. Thuy\u2019s interest in pharmacy began during her time volunteering at a local Buddhist temple, where she met an abbot who happened to be a retired pharmacist. She admired his compassion toward others and respected his use of pharmaceutical knowledge to help relieve physical pain and illnesses for those who did not have access to healthcare. She went on to pursue a career in pharmacy and was among the first clinical pharmacists hired to pioneer a decentralized clinical pharmacy model at the University of Arizona Medical Center.\n\nAfter accumulating clinical experience in Arizona for 13 years, Dr. Thuy relocated to Houston and joined HCA Healthcare\u2019s Gulf Coast Division COE pharmacy department. \u201cMy role allows me to expand my clinical experience while catching and correcting medication errors before reaching our patients, and tailoring drug therapy to meet individual patients\u2019 needs,\u201d Dr. Thuy said. \u201cMedication interventions require me to regularly communicate and collaborate with providers, onsite pharmacists, nurses and patients.

Information displayed for each location includes the type of site \u2014 such as community health clinics, recovery support services or vending machines \u2014 and their hours, phone numbers and websites.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, when Naloxone is administered, it attaches to opioid receptors in the brain and blocks the effects of opioids, allowing users\u2019 breathing to be restored.\n\nJordan Baker, a TODA program manager, worked with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and an initiative led by the University of Texas Health San Antonio called Naloxone Texas to create the map. He said an analysis revealed access to Naloxone was a primary issue across the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe did interviews with local harm-reduction organizations and prevention agencies, a lot of universities and really just subject matter experts and community members and those lived experiences to identify regional challenges,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut across the board, we heard that access and awareness of where the Naloxone was a big issue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2023, TODA received $3.9 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides grant funding to 90 health departments across the country to reduce drug overdoses and the impact of related harms, using data surveillance on drug poisonings. The grant program runs through 2028, with required reapplication each year for continued funding.\n\nTODA recently submitted its application for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, a DSHS spokesperson told StateScoop.\n\nBaker said the tool also highlights resource deserts \u2014 areas where residents have limited access to essential resources such as food, health care, green spaces or other necessities, often due to factors like historical disinvestment or systemic inequalities \u2014 in West Texas, where there are few Naloxone distribution sites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that, as a result of the map, has been brought to TODA\u2019s attention, and we\u2019re working with Naloxone Texas to try to get some more resources in that area,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe\u2019re also working with some of the community paramedicine teams about how we can bring stronger prevention support to the more rural and large land masses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2024 report from Texas DSHS showed a nearly 20% decrease in fentanyl-related poisoning deaths, with at least 430 fewer Texans dying from fentanyl-related poisoning compared with the previous year. The decrease comes after five straight years of increases, which saw fentanyl-related poisoning deaths in Texas rise by more than 600% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nBaker said TODA collects data on fatal and non-fatal drug poisonings from hospitals, emergency medical services, toxicology reports and death investigation reports, to better understand drug poisonings.\n\nShe said the program plans to create a non-fatal drug poisoning data dashboard in the next few months that will display overdose trends by drug type, age group and other demographic information.\n\n\u201cAll of our partners want data,\u201d Baker said. \u201cOur purpose is to utilize that data to inform their local prevention strategies, and then kind of roll all that up to our overall state strategy of supporting the reduction of drug poisonings.\u201d", "source_domain": "statescoop.com", "article_id": "4336f94c-8507-4b52-b646-6895e587c37b", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}
{"url": "https://news.cuanschutz.edu/emergency-medicine/overdose-dashboard-informs-patient-care", "title": "Opioid Overdose Dashboard Enhances Research and Clinical Practices", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Last week, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), in partnership with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), launched a first-of-its-kind national data dashboard of non-fatal opioid overdoses across the country.\n\nIdentifying populations at-risk for a fatal overdose who would benefit from treatment will help clinicians, providers, and first responders identify resources to improve care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 75% of the nearly 92,000 drug overdose deaths in 2020 involved an opioid. The new dashboard will also help providers and first responders serve populations that need help curbing the opioid crisis.\n\nTwo University of Colorado Department of Emergency Medicine faculty see an opportunity to use the data to focus on local patient impact and care through a research, clinical, and educational lens.\n\nData-informed research and practice\n\nThe dashboard uses data from the National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Information System (NEMSIS) maintained by NHTSA. The NEMSIS data includes electronic patient care records completed by nearly 95% of all EMS agencies nationwide. On average, the data submitted to the national NEMSIS database are 99% complete within two weeks.\n\n\u201cGetting close to real-time data every two weeks is revolutionary for research at this scale,\u201d says Jason Hoppe, DO, lead investigator for the Opioid Research Program and associate professor of emergency medicine at the CU School of Medicine.\n\nHoppe\u2019s research looks to improve safety of prescription opioids, improve decision-making for prescribing opioids, and quantify long-term consequences of prescription opioids. It also looks to evaluate the impact of legislative changes and build a collaborative community to initiate treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) in emergency departments and community clinics.\n\nHoppe anticipates the dashboard will play an important role informing interventions to assist clinicians and providers in providing evidence-based treatment for patients following an overdose.\n\n\u201cOne main focus of our research is to track those patients, who have just experienced a life-altering event, after the overdose,\u201d says Hoppe. \u201cWhen the patient has overdosed, the first responder or clinician will often administer naloxone, a medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose, to give patients a second chance at life. As revolutionary as it is, naloxone is only a bandage on the problem at large. Getting patients into treatment is the long-term fix.\u201d\n\nHowever, tracking those who refuse medical care or those left to make their own recovery plan has been a barrier. With the new dashboard, researchers can see the number of patients who overdosed and weren\u2019t taken to a facility. Non-fatal overdoses are an important time to intervene because 7-18% of patients seen in an emergency room, for a non-fatal overdose, die the following year.\n\nIncarcerated individuals with OUD are also at significant risk upon release from the justice system. Hoppe\u2019s Opioid Research Program has partnered with the Bureau of Justice Assistance and community partners to improve access to treatment that will contribute to these individuals\u2019 success, and hopefully save lives.\n\nPrograms aim to maximize local impact\n\n\u201cThe federal strategy behind the dashboard shines a spotlight on the severity of the nationwide issue, but the dashboard itself is unique in that it allows us to identify our local communities at risk,\u201d says Hoppe. \u201cGetting specific data on our populations in the Denver Metro area allows us to have high-level discussions with other health care directors and providers on how to best serve our state.\u201d\n\nHoppe\u2019s research connects directly with first responders, including firefighters, police, and paramedics who serve patients at risk for a second, fatal overdose.\n\nAngela Wright, MD, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the CU School of Medicine and medical director for UCHealth Denver Metro EMS, sees a direct impact of the dashboard for the first responders she oversees.\n\n\u201cThis dashboard allows our first responders to sort by state or region and serve areas that may need more resources than others,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThe types of resources we aim to provide to areas in need can come in the form of grants, protocol changes, new types of therapies, and safely-administered medications.\u201d\n\nSimilar to Hoppe, Wright believes the dashboard\u2019s tailored data will inform local, high-level change.\n\n\u201cI meet frequently with a group of health care directors in the Denver Metro area to review protocols and develop plans based on our system and state needs. Even though we represent different health care systems, our collective goal is to provide the best possible patient care across Colorado. Having data on hand to make local decisions and discuss trends will be a new, positive asset.\u201d\n\nEducation for first responders\n\nWith federal support to focus on preventing drug-related deaths, Wright sees training and education for first responders as the biggest area for growth in emergency medicine.\n\n\u201cWe aim to provide the best education and direction for our first responders, so that when they\u2019re put in the position to serve a patient who\u2019s overdosed, they can feel confident administering each step of care,\u201d says Wright.\n\nWright plans to launch a pre-hospital education program focused on training paramedics in May 2023. The program is a collaboration with UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital and the CU Department of Emergency Medicine.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bigger need each year to train the first responder workforce, so partnering with campus resources seemed like the perfect opportunity to launch the program,\u201d says Wright. \u201cCampus-wide partnership is crucial in the success of this up-and-coming program.\u201d\n\nThe connections between Wright\u2019s training goals and Hoppe\u2019s research will ultimately improve care in treating patients to who overdose.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing mission to treat opioid overdoses is a collaborative effort to find out the patients\u2019 needs and to know about the available resources,\u201d says Hoppe. \u201cEMS happens to work adjacent to hospital systems, and the treatment can be tricky because the patient is not yet connected to a provider. It can put a lot of pressure on EMS clinicians. My goal is to help lessen that work through evidence-based practices and support the educational piece of training first responders. We want to improve how they\u2019re able to administer care, especially to these high-risk populations.\u201d", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu", "article_id": "0bcf9118-a33d-4b97-a23c-1b7917c349c0", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

That\u2019s according to a new analysis from the American Medical Association, the Colorado Medical Society and Manatt Health.\n\nColorado is one of four states the AMA decided to spotlight with a deep-dive look at what it\u2019ll take to stop the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nIn 2013, then-Gov. John Hickenlooper launched a process to develop one of the first statewide comprehensive efforts in the country to address the issue. The efforts included better educating providers about the problem, providing an easier way for people to dispose of their unused opioids and mandating wider use of a prescription drug monitoring program. And in May 2018, Hickenlooper signed a bill to limit how many opioids doctors can prescribe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely leading the country in my opinion,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Clapp, a pain specialist based in Greenwood Village.\n\nClapp, who works with a Colorado Medical Society prescription drug abuse committee, said the state has been \u201cvery thoughtful as far as not ignoring patients who really are in pain,\u201d while at the same time trying to both keep patients safe and find opioid alternatives.\n\nThe report credits the state in several areas: Colorado adopted policies and funding to help more people get access to medication-assisted treatment. It pushed for insurers to cover addiction treatment and non-opioid alternatives for pain management. And, Clapp said, it expanded access to the overdose drug naloxone.\n\n\u201cThis has made a difference,\u201d Clapp said. \u201cI saw a number, an estimate, that already the naloxone has saved thousands of lives in Colorado and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an understatement.\u201d\n\nDespite all that, the grim toll of the epidemic continues. There\u2019s been a 21 percent drop in opioid prescriptions since 2013 \u2014 yet the state\u2019s overdose death rate rose over the last two years. More than a thousand Coloradans died from drug overdoses in 2017, a record.\n\nThe AMA report urges Colorado to expand access to medication-assisted treatment, especially in rural areas. That treatment includes the use of FDA-approved meds like methadone, naltrexone and buprenorphine, along with counseling.\n\nClapp said it starts with eliminating barriers to treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen someone comes in and wants to get medication-assisted treatment, they want off the opioids, they want to get better, there\u2019s still many payers out there that will not cover their treatment.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org", "article_id": "04e30d24-be70-48b0-b990-a6d8a86b6a58", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Technology that alerts physicians of an overdose history. Immediate and affordable access to overdose-reversing medication. Resources that support early intervention.\n\nThese types of tools may seem illusory. But the Texas Medical Association\u2019s Committee on Behavioral Health has a clear vision of these and other solutions needed to empower physicians to combat the opioid crisis without compromising their ability to provide the best care possible to all their patients.\n\n\u201cThe more time a physician has to spend translating data into clinically actionable information ... the less time they have to connect with their patients and deliver better patient care,\u201d said Michael Sprintz, DO, a pain and addiction specialist in Spring and member of the committee.\n\n\u201cWe have a massive population of people that are under-identified and under-treated for a lot of behavioral health issues that increase the probability of developing a substance use problem and or overdose,\u201d he said. At the same time, \u201cwhen we talk about protecting our patients, it\u2019s not just protecting our patients in identifying a substance use disorder in someone. It\u2019s protecting our patients who don\u2019t have a substance use disorder,\u201d so they can still access needed medications.\n\nTexas continues to take steps to address the opioid problem, with TMA weighing in most recently on potential interim study items by the Texas House Public Health Committee. TMA also helped win reinstatement of state funding to make electronic health record (EHR) integration with the state\u2019s prescription monitoring program (PMP) free for all medical professionals, and the passage of a law requiring certain school campuses to have opioid antagonists on hand.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott named the fentanyl crisis an emergency item in early 2023. Later in the year, Texas\u2019 Opioid Abatement Fund Council (OAFC) \u2013 formed to manage money recovered from statewide opioid lawsuit settlements \u2013 announced the first of its responses to the crisis: prevent overdoses with distribution of naloxone, promote drug prevention education in schools and communities, and strengthen the behavioral health workforce.\n\nBut state plans still lack what physicians have long called for: more complete and accessible data that can guide clinical decisions and, equally important, early intervention.\n\n\u201cBeing able to have these sorts of conversations that then begin to address the use disorders in families becomes so important,\u201d said Leslie Secrest, MD, a Dallas psychiatrist and co-chair of the Committee on Behavioral Health. \u201cThat is the area that we\u2019d like to see something begin to change, and processes change, that allow [substance use disorder] to be identified and worked with early on, [as well as] figure out ways to facilitate prevention of those events.\u201d\n\nThe data gap\n\nWhile physicians may not see immediate change, the work and attention on opioids is part of an overall positive trend.\n\nTMA continues to monitor OAFC\u2019s recently proposed rules to guide the distribution of an estimated $166.7 million in opioid settlement funds to more than 150 hospital districts over an estimated 18 years, as directed by state law.\n\nPerhaps acknowledging the data gap, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently gave states, including Texas, a grant aimed at least in part at improving data collection and analysis and expanding and modernizing data systems.\n\nAbout $1.6 million of the five-year Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) grant from CDC will go toward expanding and modernizing data systems. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) will lead the charge on the health information improvements; the Texas Health and Human Services Commission will use the remaining $2.3 million of the grant to implement solutions based on DSHS\u2019 findings.\n\nThe OD2A state program provides support for clinician education and training, as well as for health information technology infrastructure improvements, including enhancements to state prescription drug monitoring programs.\n\nIn Texas, that means the PMP, which, along with emergency medical services (EMS) data collection, falls short, says Dr. Sprintz.\n\nTMA has long advocated for usability and access improvements to the PMP. The Committee on Behavioral Health would like to see the integration of more helpful enhancements that paint a more complete picture of a patient\u2019s history, for example, by creating an alert when a given patient has a history of overdose and integrating better EMS data that may otherwise not make it to an EHR.\n\nPhysicians \u201cneed to be able to look at the information and instantly grasp it in a visually usable way that enables them to go, \u2018Oh, OK, I see what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d Dr. Sprintz said.\n\nHe is clear that having the PMP \u201cis absolutely better than not having it.\u201d Throughout much of its tumultuous implementation, however, the overwhelming amount and inaccessibility of PMP data have rendered it not clinically useful.\n\n\u201cThe data is not yet in an easily actionable format that physicians or providers without much experience are able to use optimally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PMP presents a patient\u2019s prescription history, along with a \u201crisk score\u201d based on the number of prescriptions, prescribers, and overlap. But Dr. Sprintz says that score is dubious at best, and physicians don\u2019t always have the time or resources to sort through patients\u2019 history.\n\nNor are physicians informed on \u201cthe actual algorithm that calculates that risk score. ... It\u2019s never been peer reviewed, yet clinicians sometimes make life-changing clinical decisions based on those risk scores,\u201d he said.\n\nIt does not account for a host of different factors that impact a patient\u2019s risk of a substance use disorder, let alone the risk of an overdose, Dr. Sprintz adds. Additionally, looking at prescription histories from neighboring states requires further legwork by the physician within the PMP. Both factors can obscure the true risk of prescribing to a patient.\n\nBetter collection of EMS data also can bridge gaps. In addition to collecting EMS data on overdose-related home visits and emergency department trips, the Committee on Behavioral Health suggests having emergency medical technicians carry additional naloxone to dispense on site, along with educational materials on low- or no-cost treatment options for substance use disorder.\n\nTexas does track overall numbers for opioid-related deaths or disabling events, Dr. Secrest says. But these data leave out a large swath of patients who may overdose and then still be vulnerable to repeat events, or patients at risk of overdose who could be reached with early intervention.\n\n\u201cA person will talk about how [a loved one] overdosed and was given naloxone, and it got them enough time for EMS to get there,\u201d Dr. Secrest said. \u201cWell, where\u2019s the metric? If you talk to the ER docs, [it\u2019s unclear] how much more they\u2019re seeing people come in or not come in by EMS because of an opioid overdose.\u201d\n\nMoreover, patients experiencing an overdose or otherwise struggling with substance use disorder often don\u2019t feel safe going to a hospital or seeing a physician, Dr. Sprintz says.\n\nAlong with a general mistrust of the health care system, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of fear. We [physicians] know we\u2019re not calling the cops on [patients]. They don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEarly interventions\n\nGovernor Abbott\u2019s emergency declaration also paved the way for greater distribution of naloxone, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March approved the first over-the-counter naloxone nasal spray; the second followed in July.\n\nDr. Sprintz, who serves on the FDA Advisory Committee that made the approval, calls it \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201ca huge step in the right direction\u201d but recognizes its limitations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to create the illusion that just handing out naloxone is going to prevent or decrease the rate of opioid use disorder, the incidence of opioid use disorder, or the prevalence in our communities. We need to do more,\u201d he said.\n\nThat includes making antagonists like naloxone more affordable and accessible, whether to individual patients, their communities, or private treatment centers.\n\nAt press time, a two-pack of naloxone nasal spray retailed at a pharmacy for about $45 without insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not inexpensive,\u201d Dr. Secrest said. \u201cHow do you get it widely available in all communities in all economic settings? That\u2019s where our opportunity is: beginning to try to have conversations of how to get this in a form that is widely available and readily obtainable.\u201d\n\nTMA\u2019s letter to the Texas House Public Health Committee offered suggestions for supporting private treatment funding and improving payment for screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment processes. These suggestions could be reformulated as budget requests or catch the eyes of medicine\u2019s allies in the legislature for future bills.\n\n\u201cBeing able to provide resources to private community groups to help distribute naloxone and educate their community is the smartest thing we could possibly do,\u201d Dr. Sprintz said. \u201cBring it back to the community in which the people live.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org", "article_id": "5458a7f2-2488-45f8-b493-50007739a3ed", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

(Shannon Tyler/Colorado Newsline)\n\nA Colorado legislative committee started looking into next steps for the state to combat the opioid crisis in a hearing Thursday.\u00a0\n\nIt was the first time in four years the Opioid and Other Substance Use Study Committee had convened. The interim committee was formed in 2017 and last convened in 2019. Over that time 14 bills and 86 policies came out of the committee.\u00a0\n\nCommittee members heard presentations from state departments and opioid use researchers on the current state of Colorado\u2019s opioid and substance use epidemic to start their work drafting bills to address the issue. The committee is led by Democratic Rep.\u00a0Chris deGruy Kennedy, the chair, and Democratic Sen. Kevin Priola, the vice chair.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nAbout half of all overdose deaths are attributed to fentanyl, which increased severely since 2013, according to Robert Valuck, the executive director of the University of Colorado Anschutz\u2019s Center for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention.\u00a0\n\nThe current opioid crisis is much different than in years past, he said. Previously, the issue was prescription medication overdoses. Fentanyl is not prescribed but found in almost every drug market, according to Valuck.\n\nHe noted that people are still overdosing on prescription drugs. Although the number of overdoses has tapered, the fentanyl crisis is an added layer to an already existing problem.\u00a0\n\nMany presenters at the meeting focused on how access to harm reduction and prevention is difficult for some residents, such as in rural areas and for communities of color.\u00a0\n\nJose Esquibel, director of CU Anschutz\u2019s Colorado Consortium, discussed Colorado\u2019s initiatives to reach people in rural areas, including mobile efforts and telehealth options.\u00a0\n\nState Sen. Rod Pelton, a Cheyenne Wells Republican, said the state needs to invest in more than just telehealth for rural communities. He said sometimes it\u2019s necessary to meet face-to-face with healthcare providers.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great tool, but I don\u2019t want it to become the norm out in rural areas,\u201d Pelton said.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the center\u2019s data, the counties with the highest rates of opioid overdose deaths from prescription drugs or heroin in 2021 were Las Animas, Moffat and Alamosa counties. The southeastern part of the state had the highest rate of opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl in 2021.\u00a0\n\nEsquibel said access to treatment practices continues to be a challenge for many. According to the center\u2019s data, the Eastern Plains and northwest Colorado have much fewer locations to treat opioid use disorders than the state average. The Front Range has a high concentration of them.\u00a0\n\nCommunities of color also have less access to nearby treatment locations. Esquibel displayed a map of the Denver metro area color-coded to show the percentage of Black residents in relation to dots representing opioid treatment care. In areas in Denver where there is a higher percentage of Black residents, there are far fewer treatment centers.\u00a0\n\n A map presented during a June 29, 2023, meeting of the Colorado Legislature\u2019s Opioid and Other Substance Use Study Committee shows the Denver metro area color-coded to show the percentage of Black residents in relation to dots representing opioid treatment care. (Screenshot)\n\n\u201cWhen I look at this, this shows an injustice. There\u2019s something not right that in those communities there\u2019s not easy access to opioid use disorder treatment,\u201d Esquibel said.\u00a0\n\nAlong with lack of access to treatment centers, there are disparities in the average rate of opioid deaths for Black and Native American beneficiaries, who have much higher rates than their white counterparts.\u00a0\n\nStigma a deterrent\n\nSeveral presenters spoke on the state\u2019s progress. According to Esquibel, Colorado has been recognized for its meaningful responses to substance abuse. But the state needs better outreach for communities of color, he said.\n\nCristen Bates, deputy Medicaid director with the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, said that while there has been progress in the opioid crisis response, that progress has disproportionately benefited white residents.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing Black, Indigenous and people of color with disproportionate increases in overdoses over time,\u201d Bates said.\u00a0\n\nOther areas of improvement the state should consider are workforce development and stigma prevention, according to Bates.\u00a0\n\nBates said stigma around opioid use treatment is \u201cactively stopping people from getting help.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe state attorney general\u2019s deputy director of opioid response, Jamie Feld, presented information on legal settlement funds the state received from several prescription drug manufacturing companies. Colorado will receive more than $700 million over 18 years with much of the funds allocated to specified regions and local municipalities.\u00a0\n\nAccording to Feld, 20% of the funds will go to local governments directly and are allocated to 19 established regions. The remaining 10% will go to statewide infrastructure and 10% directly to the state.\u00a0Funds for Tribal communities will come out of the state share, according to Feld. She said the state is in the process of finalizing a contract for about $2 million of the funds.\u00a0\n\nWith 312 local governments agreeing to the program, Colorado was one of the first states in the nation to get such a level of agreement, according to Feld. She said $33 million has already been released.\u00a0\n\nMore meetings planned\n\nTwo county commissioners working with the settlement funds in their regions spoke to the committee members about their work. Prowers County Commissioner Wendy Buxton-Andrade representing Region 19, which covers southeastern Colorado, \u00a0said the region has received a little over $2.7 million, which has been used in part to educate the community on the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cWe found that many in our communities had different perceptions about what harm reduction actually is,\u201d Buxton-Andrade said.\u00a0\n\nShe said in the region local officials are working on a website with resources and a local marketing campaign that includes QR codes and business cards for law enforcement to distribute information to the public.\u00a0\n\nThe committee will meet six times during the interim session, diving deeper into specific aspects of the opioid crisis to draft legislation addressing overdose deaths in the state before the regular legislative session, which starts in January.\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\n\nSUPPORT\nREPUBLISH\n\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Several states are collectively putting billions into safety-net hospitals with ties to both the civil and justice systems. At the same time, the private sector struggles to convert demand for services into business opportunities.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy-era deinstitutionalization, public and private investment in psychiatric hospitals, which care for those with the most dire and acute behavioral health issues, has fallen well short of patient demand and need. Similarly, investment in community-based behavioral health and social services has not reached a level to either allow for care in lower-acuity settings or prevent them altogether.\n\n\u201cThe pendulum might have swung from a point where we had too many beds and too many people institutionalized in the 1960s to another extreme where the community investment has not been there to keep people out of a fewer number beds,\u201d Nelson Jarrin, senior vice president of state policy at the Texas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, told BHB.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeadows Mental Health Policy Institute is a nonpartisan mental health policy think tank.\n\nThe situation leaves state administrations and legislatures looking for ways to intervene. Most of those actions exclude private-sector partners. Rather, these initiatives compensate for the private sector\u2019s failure to meet the overwhelming demand while making up for decades of underinvestment.\n\nOver the past seven years, Texas\u2019 state legislature has appropriated just over $3.6 billion into state psychiatric hospitals and other community-based psychiatric bed initiatives. This is part of a larger effort to bolster the behavioral health economy in Texas. Earlier in the year, the Texas legislature allocated $11 billion to several behavioral health-related projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second-largest state in the U.S., its roughly 30 million resident population is about the same size as the 19 least populous states in the country, according to 2022 census data.\n\nPublic-private partnerships are included in these funding efforts but are few; most of the funding is dedicated to alleviating a severe shortage of psychiatric beds meant to rehabilitate those with connections to the justice system. These so-called forensic beds are often the exclusive purview of state hospitals and have experienced a dramatic transformation in who they treat.\n\nAbout 30 years ago, roughly 70% of the patients in Texas state psychiatric hospitals were there for civil reasons, with the remainder committed for care while they were awaiting trial or were deemed incompetent to stand trial, Jarrin said. Today, the ratio has reversed, with forensic patients making up the vast majority of state hospital\u2019s rosters.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about private companies and private psychiatric beds, they generally want to stay in the civil space,\u201d Jarrin said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to take anybody who has criminal charges or is found incompetent to stand trial, even though the treatment component is essentially the same for forensic patients.\u201d\n\nThe shortage of forensic psychiatric beds has led to a 2,200-person waitlist within the justice system.\n\nIn instances where private organizations have partnered with state and local governments in Texas, private entities have had to take on beds for low-level forensic patients to alleviate the waitlist.\n\nSome examples of partnerships with private organizations include Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas getting $64 million to add 72 beds to an existing campus and $102 million to complete the Texas Behavioral Health Center in Dallas.\n\nThe latter project includes the involvement of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, which is affiliated with the state university system, as well as the UT Southwestern Medical School. State universities and medical schools offer compelling partners for reinvigorating state hospital systems. Oklahoma officials recently announced initiatives with some similarities to those in Texas.\n\nKeeping state hospital investment in government family\n\nPublic universities and their affiliated medical schools and health systems already have the infrastructure and the know-how to partner with state officials on big-dollar, potentially systemically relevant investments.\n\nThe Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) announced on Sept. 11 that it will partner with Oklahoma State University (OSU) to build a 330-bed psychiatric hospital at the OSU-Oklahoma City campus.\n\nThe facility will cost $147 million and provide 275 adult beds and 55 pediatric beds. Named Donahue Behavioral Health, the facility will replace Griffin Memorial Hospital, based in Norman, Oklahoma, and add 100 net new beds to the state hospital system. Doors are expected to open in 2026.\n\n\u201cLike many states, our state psychiatric hospitals are very old and take a lot of dollars in upkeep,\u201d ODMHSAS Commissioner Carrie Slatton-Hodges told BHB. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wanting to have services and facilities for persons with mental illness that rival the best care that can be received from physical care.\u201d\n\nThe funds for the project come from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021, a Biden administration stimulus funding and policy project meant to propel the country out of the COVID-era economic slump and reform several aspects of American infrastructure. It pumped billions into state and county government coffers. An ARPA-focused legislative committee championed the project.\n\nDonahue Behavioral Health will not be a forensic hospital, Slatton-Hodges said. However, police will be able to get people experiencing a mental health crisis to this or other behavioral health urgent care centers run by the states.\n\n\u201cWe have found over and over that people inadvertently go the criminal route if they don\u2019t have resources readily available,\u201d Slatton-Hodges said. \u201c[Police officers] are much more likely to not move that person down a criminal path if those resources are readily available.\u201d\n\nSlatton-Hodges notes that the demands of patients and the ability of medical professionals to treat behavioral health facilities fundamentally changed what state psychiatric hospitals will look like now and in the future. In short, Slatton-Hodges says the era of warehousing those with disabilities is long over.\n\nThe new facility will include a significant urgent care and outpatient care offering meant to keep people at the right level of care rather than defaulting to warehousing people for all behavioral health issues.\n\nWhile the deinstitutionalization movement may have overshot shrinking psychiatric beds, the need for beds has changed as well; states won\u2019t need to offer as many thousands of beds for patients as they did decades ago.\n\n\u201cThe right number of beds changed,\u201d Slatton-Hodges said. \u201cWhile we no longer need institutions or places for people to live separate from the community, we still need a place for people when they are experiencing acute symptoms, to be able to have those stabilized so that they can continue with their life within the community.\u201d\n\nSlatton-Hodges said that private investment into psychiatric facilities was lacking for adults but tended to appear more robustly for pediatric patients. She noted that while private investment supported broader spectrums of behavioral health, it often could not meet the present need.\n\n\u201cIf you operate in the private setting, you\u2019re not going to build something based on a high uninsured rate that will need that service,\u201d Slatton-Hodges said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road for the private health systems to feel like psychiatric care for an adult population is a business that is viable\u2026 I don\u2019t know that behavioral health will ever be as lucrative as, say, opening a cancer wing or opening a heart wing.\u201d\n\nStepping into the private market void\n\nThe private sector of psychiatric care is somewhat enigmatic.\n\nThese facilities face immense systemic pressures, leading to several for-profit and nonprofit health care organizations shuttering whole facilities or divisions altogether. At the same time, several businesses are trying to crack the code to meet the immense need for psychiatric care in a way that makes financial sense, often through partnerships and joint ventures.\n\nStill, while the private sector struggles with the business case of psychiatric hospitals, state governments often see themselves as the last line of defense for providing care. The issue is even worse for patients whose mental health issues may have led to violent tendencies or run-ins with law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThere is very little bed capacity within the private sector; where else are forensic patients going to go?\u201d Tyler Hemstreet, a Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) representative, told BHB in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s only the state taking care of these people because, if it wasn\u2019t us, they wouldn\u2019t be in a private hospital.\n\n\u201cWe take on the most complex cases, and we\u2019re the end of the line for a lot of these patients.\u201d\n\nDSHS entered the private market to buy a facility that Acadia Healthcare Co. Inc. (Nasdaq: ACHC) shuttered in Tukwila, Washington. In August, DSHS bought the facility for $30 million, according to the Seattle Times.\n\nThe facility will convert to exclusively serving civil patients after they\u2019ve resolved their obligations and care as forensic patients, Hemstreet said. The move adds more beds to the state hospital system. But, because of that, they will no longer be available to private patients. It prevents the hospital from going unused and serving no purpose in the local health care economy.\n\n\u201cWhile they (patients) are still getting some behavioral health care, the key role in the competency restoration evaluation is to send them back to court to face their charges,\u201d Hemstreet said.", "source_domain": "bhbusiness.com", "article_id": "4b6beae2-cc4d-460a-bf93-3a531ca9b486", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Why are they still illegal in Texas?", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Op-Eds Fentanyl test strips save lives. Why are they still illegal in Texas? | Opinion\n\nLast year, a fentanyl-contaminated batch of crack cocaine killed at least 12 people and led to 70 overdose 911 calls in just 72 hours in Austin. Such a tragedy underscores the gravity of Texas\u2019 overdose crisis and should be a wakeup call to state lawmakers. Fortunately, there are tools \u2014 simple test strips that indicate whether a drug is tainted with a dangerous substance like fentanyl \u2014 that help people make safer choices when it comes to substance use and reduce their overdose risk. Unfortunately, those tools are illegal in Texas.\n\nBut a new piece of legislation, introduced by a Republican state representative, could change this and save countless Texans\u2019 lives.\n\nIllicit drug use has never been completely safe \u2014 an unregulated supply means there\u2019s minimal transparency or quality control. But a decade ago, when I was conducting field work with people who used methamphetamine, my participants could assume their supply would be opioid-free. And those using heroin rarely worried that their usual dose would be 50 times stronger than expected.\n\nNow, however, the rise of synthetics has resulted in a market dominated by the highly potent opioid fentanyl, with a roster of novel adulterants \u2014 substances added to the drug supply to enhance experience, add weight or improve delivery efficiency \u2014 waiting in the wings.\n\nIndeed, recent research from many states, including Texas, found that up to 15% of stimulant samples now contain fentanyl, too. And the animal tranquilizer xylazine has made its way into the Texas supply.\n\nThese adulterants in the illicit supply are serious public health threats. People who primarily use stimulants or psychedelics often lack protective tolerance against fentanyl, making them especially vulnerable to an overdose. And, because fentanyl is so potent and fast-acting, even people who have used opioids for decades are at risk. Meanwhile, xylazine complicates overdose because it depresses breathing but does not respond to the overdose reversal medication naloxone.\n\nChecking drugs by using test strips, or more advanced technologies, to test a small amount of a drug for adulterants such as fentanyl or xylazine, can provide people with the information to make safer decisions about their drug use, reducing their overdose risk.\n\nTexas is one of just four holdout states in which possession, free distribution and sale of this life-saving equipment remains a crime.\n\nThat glaring legislative gap is likely part of why the state is seeing a smaller decline (about 10 percent) in overdose deaths relative to its neighbors (between 20 and 28 percent) \u2014 all of which have authorized some form of drug checking equipment \u2014 and the rest of the country.\n\nThis is why Texas State Rep. Tom Oliverson, a Republican and an anesthesiologist, has introduced a single, straightforward piece of legislation that could save a lot of lives. His effort is driving home the idea that the overdose crisis warrants pragmatic, health-based solutions, not partisan battles. The illicit drug market is constantly in flux, so saving lives means letting people check for a wide range of potential adulterants, not just the ones we know about. Rep. Oliverson\u2019s bill includes language permitting the possession and distribution of equipment that tests for xylazine as well as fentanyl.\n\nAllowing people who use drugs to possess and community health organizations to distribute fentanyl and xylazine test strips will save lives. Texans who use drugs will be empowered to make safer choices and will have an opportunity to access much-needed health services. The evidence is clear: states should adopt the broadest drug checking legislation allowed by their political climate, and this bill is a massive step in the right direction.", "source_domain": "www.rstreet.org", "article_id": "43b0cf8d-7e7e-45f5-9213-a32eb1fb06d8", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

A little more than a year after that House vote, in April 2024, at least nine people\u2014that\u2019s the official count, though the Texas Observer found it could have been as many as 12\u2014died in just a few days in and around Austin, victims of a tainted batch of crack cocaine that caused dozens of fentanyl overdoses across the city. As the Observer reported earlier this year, legalized testing strips could have detected the presence of fentanyl in the adulterated crack, saving lives.\n\nNow, this April 23, the House unanimously passed House Bill 1644, a similar measure that would legalize strips that check for fentanyl as well as xylazine, a non-opioid tranquilizer that has been found in the U.S. drug supply. That legislation is now exactly where its predecessor died, the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, chaired by Senator Pete Flores, a Pleasonton Republican. Its supporters on both sides of the aisle are anxiously waiting to see if it fares better this session.\n\nCurrent state law makes it a misdemeanor to possess any materials for drug checking. That can include things like advanced laboratory equipment, but advocates have focused on strips: little pieces of paper that look like take-home COVID tests and alert to the presence of certain drugs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tools. These are testing strips. They\u2019re not expensive. They\u2019re incredibly effective and they\u2019re drastically needed in our community,\u201d said Eli Cortez, an organizer with Vocal-TX, an organization that advocates for reform on a wide range of issues including the war on drugs. \u201cHaving testing equipment so people know what\u2019s in the substance they\u2019re about to use is just so important right now.\u201d\n\nAs the Observer previously reported, Texas has been slow to embrace practices associated with harm reduction, a broadly defined term for helping people who use drugs without stigmatizing or imposing strict parameters while also involving drug users in planning and implementation. The Observer\u2019s investigation of the April 2024 overdoses in Austin found that many of those affected did not know they were consuming fentanyl. Though some Texas harm reduction organizations quietly distribute testing strips, their prohibition here limits what funds can be used to purchase them, and government agencies like Austin-Travis County EMS, which was instrumental in the response to the tainted crack, cannot distribute them. And in an atmosphere in which drug use is highly stigmatized, local officials did not share with the public information that experts said could have prevented additional overdoses. Though Texas has lagged behind other states in facilitating access to naloxone, the overdose reversal drug commonly sold as Narcan, the state government, along with Austin and Travis County, has recently ramped up distribution. Its widespread availability undoubtedly saved lives in Austin.\n\nThe year the testing strip bill failed, 2023, was the deadliest for overdoses in Texas history: More than 5,000 people perished of overdoses from all types of drugs, according to state data. (Researchers say Texas probably undercounts overdose deaths because most counties rely on poorly trained justices of the peace to handle death investigations.) Last year, Texas partly followed the national trend of overdoses decreasing. From July 2023 to July 2024, Centers for Disease Control numbers showed overdoses nationally falling nearly 17 percent, whereas Texas saw a smaller 4 percent decrease.\n\nThe liberal bastions of Oregon and Washington, which have taken less punitive approaches to addressing overdoses, saw slight increases in overdoses. Texas leaders have attributed this to the tough-on-drugs approach they\u2019ve embraced. But researchers and harm reductionists say that when a new drug hits the market in a region, overdoses almost inevitably spike, then recede as health workers and people who use drugs adapt. They say Texas is lagging behind the rest of the country to implement policies, like the testing strip bill, that would save lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 2023 to November 2024 CDC numbers show Texas has made more progress reducing overdoses with a nearly 15 percent decrease, but it still didn\u2019t keep up with the nationwide decrease of 26 percent. Washington and Oregon, meanwhile, showed significant turnarounds with decreases of 12 and 20 percent.\n\nThe prevalence of naloxone and people adjusting how they use drugs are likely part of why overdoses are falling. A darker explanation looms as well: Many people who were most at risk of a fentanyl overdose have passed away.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting better and better over time at safer using practices,\u201d said Claire Zagorski, a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Austin who\u2019s worked in harm reduction for years. \u201cAnd the denominator is changing. People are dying and we have fewer people being exposed to these high-risk drugs.\u201d\n\nThat means the narrowness of Oliverson\u2019s bill may limit its utility. \u201cOver the years, this is going to keep changing,\u201d Zagorski said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be less fentanyl and more something else.\u201d\n\nBut the bill\u2019s supporters say giving people who use drugs and public health workers a better idea of what\u2019s in the supply will still save lives, even if some would like to see all forms of drug checking legalized. Fentanyl remains a huge issue, especially for people who don\u2019t regularly use opioids. And while xylazine is a big problem in other states, researchers in Texas don\u2019t believe it\u2019s widespread here\u2014yet.\n\nWhat the testing strip bill\u2019s chances of passing are this time around is unclear. Lege watchers say that some Republicans in the Senate\u2014generally run as a tight ship by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick\u2014remain opposed to any legislation around drug use that isn\u2019t enforcement-focused.\n\nFlores, the Criminal Justice Committee chairman, hasn\u2019t given a hearing to an identical Senate bill referred to his committee back in February, even though it has bipartisan support. One of that bill\u2019s authors is Senator Bob Hall, an Edgewood Republican who rose out of the Tea Party movement in 2014. Oliverson, an anesthesiologist and the legislation\u2019s House shepherd two sessions in a row, has staked out far-right positions on other issues. But their conservative bona fides haven\u2019t been enough to get their bills a hearing before Flores, who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cObviously people use drugs,\u201d Oliverson said during an April hearing of the House Public Health Committee. \u201cI wish they didn\u2019t. I want to be clear that I\u2019m not somebody who supports the idea of illicit drug use, but we live in a country, we live in a world, where drug addiction is a mental illness, and I want everyone to get treatment for it.

According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas surpassed the rate in urban areas in 2015. Drug overdose deaths also increased 325 percent in rural counties between 1999 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI went to these communities because I needed to see what is going on,\u201d Mangadu, associate professor of public health sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso, said about her two-day fact-finding trip to Hudspeth, Culberson, Presidio, Brewster and Jeff Davis counties with a collaborator from the Texas Department of State Health Services\u2019 Office of Border Public Health (OBPH).\n\nIn Presidio, Mangadu also met with local stakeholders from the border town of Ojinaga, Chihuahua, Mexico, and learned about the health professional shortages and health disparities in the border rural counties.\n\n\u201cThe consensus in these areas is that we need more treatment and prevention services, a bigger health care workforce, more research and more coordinated care,\u201d she said.\n\nMangadu\u2019s fact-finding mission was the basis for a new project funded by a $200,000 grant awarded to Aliviane Inc. from the Health Resources and Services Administration\u2019s (HRSA) Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP). UTEP\u2019s new Minority AIDS Research Center (MARC) is one of the grant\u2019s subrecipients.\n\nThe RCORP is a multi-year opioid-focused initiative supported by HRSA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, aimed at reducing the morbidity and mortality of substance use disorder, including opioid use disorder, in high-risk rural communities.\n\nIn May 2019, HRSA awarded $24 million in RCORP grants to rural organizations across 40 states to combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.\n\nThe Aliviane grant established a multi-sector consortium focused on developing strategies for preventing and treating substance use and opioid use disorder in high-risk rural communities along the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nThe consortium, which involves Aliviane, MARC, OBPH and the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence (CASFV), will develop a plan for opioid use disorder response in Hudspeth, Culberson, Presidio, Brewster and Jeff Davis counties.\n\n\u201cThe proximity of these counties to the Mexico border is a high risk for opioid use,\u201d said Guillermo Valenzuela, Aliviane\u2019s chief corporate officer. \u201cMexico remains the primary source of heroin available in the United States, according to all available sources of intelligence, including law enforcement investigations and scientific data.\u201d\n\nThe consortium is one of six projects underway by UTEP\u2019s MARC. Founded in 2019 by Mangadu and Nate Robinson, UTEP assistant vice president for facility security in the Office of Research and Sponsored Projects, the center aims to advance research and treatment for minority populations relative to HIV/AIDS, with complementary work in substance abuse.\n\nProjects address AIDS-related health disparities such as substance abuse, mental health, and exposure to violence in vulnerable populations locally and worldwide.\n\nIn addition to working with community partners such as Aliviane, a nonprofit drug treatment center in El Paso, MARC also has established international partnerships in Eastern and Southern Africa through its Global Alliance for Healthier Populations (GAHP).\n\n\u201cThe consortium is among UTEP\u2019s many efforts toward improving our border community and the levels of community engagement,\u201d said Robinson, MARC\u2019s deputy director. \u201cThe goal for MARC is to support our partners, like Aliviane, the grant\u2019s lead recipient, in building greater capacity and reach and its formal bringing together of a public private partnership to address disparities.\u201d\n\nOver the course of one year, the consortium will lead the efforts to conduct a regional needs assessment and workforce development plan in Texas Health Service Region 10, which includes the five West Texas rural counties.\n\nAccording to Aliviane, these counties are vulnerable to substance use and opioid use disorder because of low socioeconomic status, lack of access to care, transportation barriers, immigration policy-related barriers, proximity to violence, access to drugs, health professional shortages, and low health literacy.\n\n\u201cThese counties have more availability to high-purity, low-cost heroin, and Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, which are now the most lethal category of opioids used in the U.S.,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cSynthetic opioids are primarily sourced from China and Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe consortium\u2019s researchers will conduct a SWOT analysis \u2013 strength, weakness, opportunity, threat \u2013 to identify opportunities and gaps in OUD prevention, treatment, and/or recovery services within the five counties. Data will be used to develop workforce, service delivery, and sustainability plans that focus on prevention, treatment and recovery.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at many things like social determinants of health, the gaps in treatment services, health professional preparation and workforce development,\u201d Mangadu said. \u201cEach of the community partners in this consortium has a vested interest because this is what we\u2019ve been doing for many years \u2013 substance use disorder and HIV-related action research. This HRSA grant is an opportunity for us to come together to make an impact in opioid use disorder in Texas\u2019 rural areas.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.utep.edu", "article_id": "4da6e6d2-231a-4ff4-a158-c0d7af58ce6e", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

That raised questions about whether deterrence policies did anything to reduce drug use. Then, this century, overdose rates skyrocketed, driven by synthetic opioids including fentanyl. Fentanyl had been around for decades, but in the 2010s it increasingly caused deaths in northeastern states. As it moved west, the nation\u2019s drug supply transformed.\n\nInitially, fentanyl was used alone or to boost the potency of other opioids and depressants like heroin and prescription pain pills. But, in recent years, people killed by fentanyl are increasingly found to have stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamine in their systems. Explanations for this vary. Stimulants may be intentionally adulterated to hook users on fentanyl. A stimulant user might take opioids to come down. An unsophisticated dealer with a small stimulant supply may add fentanyl to stretch it. And failure to clean scales or surfaces can also mix fentanyl with another drug.\n\nIn Texas, overdose rates increased dramatically starting in 2020. From June 2023 to June 2024, more than 5,000 people died of an overdose in the state, with Travis County recording the highest fentanyl-related death rate among Texas\u2019 most populous counties in recent years. Though Texas has one of the lower overdose rates in the nation, deaths in the state declined by less than 3 percent from 2023 to 2024, while the rest of the nation saw a drop of nearly 15 percent, per the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In October, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it recorded a 13-percent drop in the state over the same period\u2014but its figures include only those overdoses deemed accidental, not those labeled intentional, suicide, or of undetermined cause.\n\nExperts also question the general accuracy of Texas\u2019 numbers. In much of the state, underfunded and under-trained justices of the peace are charged with death investigations. Overdoses, which require costly autopsies and toxicology reports, are easy to overlook.\n\nIn response to the overdose increase, HHS in 2017 launched the Texas Targeted Opioid Response (TTOR) initiative. HHS is also part of a state awareness campaign using billboards and social media ads focused on cautionary tales of young Texans who overdosed. At the same time, state leaders have doubled down on criminalization.\n\nIn 2023, the Legislature passed a law allowing prosecutors to bring murder charges in fentanyl overdose cases. Critics say this discourages people from reporting emergencies, and research shows such laws harm public health. Some who overdosed in Austin last April had shared drugs, putting survivors at risk of being charged. In 2021, the Legislature passed a good samaritan law ostensibly meant to protect people who call 911 to report an overdose. The law created a defense for people arrested for low-level possession, but it has so many caveats\u2014you can only use it once in your life, it doesn\u2019t apply if you\u2019ve been convicted of a drug-related felony, you can\u2019t use it if you\u2019ve reported another overdose in the last 18 months\u2014that you\u2019d need a flow chart to understand it. Critics say the statute\u2019s of little use.\n\n\u201cThe fentanyl-induced or the drug-induced homicide laws, that jacks up the consequences and the intensity so much more,\u201d said Alex White, director of services at the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance, an Austin nonprofit that does street outreach, operates a drop-in center, and provides supplies including for hygiene and wound care.\n\nSome states, like Maryland and Vermont, make a point of prioritizing input from people who use or have used drugs while crafting policy. Harm reduction advocates say this is lacking in Texas, though HHS does have a low-profile advisory committee that is required to include members who\u2019ve received mental health or addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking that you know how to serve folks, and you don\u2019t have those folks at the table when you\u2019re trying to serve them, it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d said Stephen Murray, a paramedic and overdose survivor on Massachusetts\u2019 Harm Reduction Advisory Council.\n\nRapid changes in the drug supply can make it difficult to conclusively track policy impacts. Critics blame Texas\u2019 persistent overdose rate at least partly on punitive laws, but a few western states including liberal Oregon\u2014which famously passed a drug decriminalization ballot measure in 2020\u2014actually saw overdoses increase between 2023 and 2024. To this, some experts and at least one study counter that fentanyl\u2019s delayed arrival on the West Coast has distorted the death rates, and that Oregon specifically did not implement sufficient services alongside decriminalization.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\n\u2022\n\nLoretta woke up on the morning of Monday, April 29, in the alley where she often goes to smoke crack and sometimes spends the night. She grew up in East Austin, only blocks away.\n\nLoretta said she lent her pipe that morning to a friend who\u2019d just purchased drugs. Then she heard someone ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d and saw the friend staring up, trance-like.\n\n\u201cHe stayed looking at the sky,\u201d Loretta said, reclining and rolling back her eyes to demonstrate. \u201cThe next thing I know he just went like this,\u201d she said, as she pantomimed slumping limply to the side. \u201cI was shaking him, and I said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 And after that he just didn\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\nDespite fear she\u2019d be held responsible, Loretta yelled to a friend to call 911. Police and paramedics swarmed the area. Loretta watched as someone else collapsed. \u201cShe hurt herself hard on the concrete and I said, \u2018Oh, my God, hell no, this is not happening.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoon, an acquaintance ran up to say Loretta\u2019s boyfriend had also collapsed in a nearby portable toilet. \u201cHe was slurring like a baby, like a little boy,\u201d Loretta said. \u201cHe started to lose consciousness. I slapped him hard. It hurt my hand. And I shook him and I started praying.\u201d\n\nAround the time that Loretta was calling out for help for her boyfriend, and EMTs were trying unsuccessfully to save Gordon, Adam Balboa showed up to work at an Austin-Travis County EMS (ATCEMS) station in south Austin. A case manager for a unit focused on substance use, Balboa heard the overdose reports and symptoms being described and knew what would save the most lives. \u201cWe needed to flood the downtown area with as much Narcan as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nOpioids in the bloodstream bind to receptors in the brain, creating euphoria. But by a quirk of physiology, excessive opioids bound to those receptors interfere with the body\u2019s ability to measure its need for oxygen, slowing breathing\u2014to the point where it can be fatal. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation can keep someone alive. Narcan temporarily blocks the receptors to opioids, essentially short-circuiting an overdose if delivered in time.\n\nThe medics and police officers in downtown Austin were running out of naloxone, but Balboa didn\u2019t just want to get them more. He also wanted to get it in the hands of people who use drugs, along with their friends, family, and neighbors. So he and colleagues began throwing together kits containing Narcan, a CPR mask, and instructions, and he hurried downtown with his SUV loaded up with the blue zippered pouches. \u201cEverybody was super receptive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were clipping it to their belts and \u2026 going about their normal business.\u201d\n\nAs common-sense as that response seems, it\u2019s one strongly associated with harm reduction. By handing out naloxone downtown, Balboa was helping those most vulnerable to the tainted drugs help one another. It\u2019s also a response that would have been impossible a few years ago.\n\nBalboa\u2019s unit is the brainchild of Mike Sasser, a 51-year-old ATCEMS captain who\u2019s been in recovery for 21 years. A longtime paramedic who often worked with Austin\u2019s unhoused population, Sasser became friends in 2018 with Mark Kinzly, a lion of the Texas harm reduction movement. Kinzly, who passed away in 2022, had helped start the Texas Overdose Naloxone Initiative, which was getting grants to distribute the medication. He had a seemingly simple idea for Sasser: ATCEMS could use grant money to buy Narcan, pass it out, and train people how to use it.\n\n\u201cMy mind was blown,\u201d Sasser said. \u201cWhy have I never thought about this? That would save so many lives.\u201d\n\nATCEMS doctors then wrote prescriptions that allowed medics to hand out naloxone (today, it\u2019s available over the counter). Sasser\u2019s unit also began reaching out directly to overdose survivors and administering a maintenance drug that reduces opioid cravings, and it now includes two full-time case managers who run an overdose reversal education program called Breathe Now.\n\nAll of this fits under the philosophy of harm reduction, which can also include teaching people to use drugs more safely and providing supplies like clean glass pipes, which help prevent disease and infection. Providing food, water, hygiene products, or wound care to people who feel stigmatized in doctor\u2019s offices is another tenet.\n\n\u201cWe want to provide people with what they need, so we can build that trust,\u201d said Em Gray, whose NICE Project provides supplies to Austinites, many of them unhoused, and stocks Narcan vending machines. \u201cThat\u2019s how we show that we are there for them; we\u2019re there to improve their quality of life, there to reduce their overdose death rates.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little funding available in Texas for the nonprofits and mutual aid groups that do this work. Across the state, harm reductionists often operate out of backpacks or car trunks.\n\nTo the state\u2019s credit, Texas has taken some steps to increase naloxone distribution. TTOR does this with an annual federal grant of about $5.5 million. In 2019, TTOR, whose Narcan distribution program is administered by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, gave about 40 percent of its naloxone to law enforcement agencies\u2014even as research shows it\u2019s more effective to give the medication to laypeople, who are typically first on the scene and present no threat of arrest\u2014an analysis by Texas Community Health News found. By 2022, TTOR\u2019s emphasis had shifted, with law enforcement making up only about 15 percent of its distribution.\n\nBut police are still prioritized in Texas\u2019 long-term naloxone plan. Under a different state program started in April 2023, the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) began distributing $75 million worth of the medication over 10 years. That naloxone, donated by a pharmaceutical company as part of a court settlement over opioid deaths, is largely earmarked for first responders. Of the more than 150,000 doses that TDEM distributed from April 2023 to September 2024, 118,000 went to law enforcement agencies, mostly sheriff\u2019s offices. Many of these offices cover areas that lack other harm reduction infrastructure, but records provided by TDEM show sheriffs aren\u2019t using the naloxone. Of 13 counties in which agencies reported using doses from TDEM by September, the highest rate of use was 3 percent. Much of that naloxone will expire later this year. In an email, a TDEM spokesperson said the agency had \u201cyet to turn down a request for naloxone\u201d and that \u201cAdministration or disposition of distributed naloxone is up to the receiving entity how they see fit, in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s guidance.\u201d\n\nWhen it set the state\u2019s two-year budget in 2023, the Legislature allocated an additional $18 million in opioid settlement funds to UT Health San Antonio, but it\u2019s not clear the appropriation will be renewed.\n\nIn the meantime, harm reductionists rely on a patchwork of naloxone sources, including local governments.\n\n\u201cHad we not saturated Austin with Narcan leading up to [the April] event, then that event would have been a lot more detrimental than it was,\u201d said Sarah Cheatham, a peer support specialist with The Other Ones Foundation, an Austin nonprofit serving the unhoused. \u201cEven when it was hard to get in our hands, we were out there doing this communication for months before this happened.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nBy late morning on April 29, the Austin Police Department (APD) had some idea what was happening. Crack rocks and pipes had been found at the scene of a number of overdoses in an area known for its use, and officers had interviewed some who\u2019d been revived with naloxone. They began looking for people seen on surveillance cameras and suspected of selling the tainted crack. While responding to an overdose, detectives found one suspect standing in front of a tent, just a block from police headquarters.\n\nWhile cops made arrests, harm reductionists tried frantically to figure out what was going on. A little after noon that Monday, Claire Zagorski, a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Austin who\u2019s worked in harm reduction for years, messaged a group chat: \u201cAustin folks there\u2019s a bad batch downtown as of this AM. Not sure on specifics but it does respond to naloxone.\u201d\n\nGroups started handing out Narcan and warning the communities they serve, but without any official information from local governments. \u201cWe were really just kind of going in blind,\u201d Cheatham said. \u201cWe were all talking to each other about, \u2018Who\u2019s going to these camps? Where is it happening? Is it happening downtown?\u2019 And I was mainly reaching out to the people that I know.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that, given the chance, drug users will reduce their risk of overdose\u2014including by carrying naloxone, not using alone, or taking a small tester dose. But, lacking detailed information, harm reduction workers in Austin were constrained. \u201cIt\u2019s distressing that the thing that got everyone activated was me being notified by a backchannel,\u201d Zagorski said.\n\nWhen local officials finally made public statements hours after the flood of 911 calls, they only addressed some questions. Whatever was killing people was responding to Narcan, officials said, in a news release and press conference. But they were vague about which drug was adulterated, and there was no mention of test strips.\n\n\u201cIt was a very chaotic scene at first,\u201d APD Lieutenant Patrick Eastlick told the Observer. \u201cSomething we can look at in the future is, if this happens again, that we reach out to these different groups where we can spread the word.\u201d\n\nOpen conversations about drugs are difficult in a state where top elected officials are cracking down on services for people who use them. In late November, state Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a headline-grabbing lawsuit to shut down a homeless navigation center at a south Austin church. The suit specifically blames the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance\u2019s needle exchange program for \u201cthe prevalence of drug paraphernalia, including used needles, littering the surrounding area.\u201d Drug use around the church \u201cfuels criminality, and creates an environment where nearby homes and businesses are at constant risk of theft,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nCritics say efforts like Paxton\u2019s just push drug use out of sight, creating greater risk. \u201cIt sends the message to people who use drugs that they should hide it, they should be kept in the dark and in the closet,\u201d said Aaron Ferguson of the Texas Drug User Health Union. \u201cThe closet is a very dangerous place for people who use drugs. It\u2019s where overdoses happen. It\u2019s where stadiums full of people die every year.\u201d\n\nAt least two who died in the Austin overdose outbreak were found alone. Family members of at least two others who perished at home told police they didn\u2019t know their loved one had used drugs that day.\n\nHow state officials talk about drug use, critics note, also suggests that only some lives matter. For example, in a 2023 legislative hearing, GOP state Senator Drew Springer\u2014in a successful attempt to woo conservative support for requiring school districts to stock naloxone in middle and high schools\u2014distinguished between different groups of Texas children. \u201cI think the general public, when they hear \u2018overdosing,\u2019 they think \u2018That\u2019s just a druggie, and that\u2019s a druggie kid\u2019s problem,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s your kid\u2019s [problem], because he may be taking a Xanax or an Adderall\u201d without knowing fentanyl was present.\n\nClaudia Dambra, who runs Street Value, a drug user health organization in Houston, criticized messaging that condemns certain substance users. \u201cAll it\u2019s doing is creating more separation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like this weird, forced social Darwinism. \u2026 It feels like they\u2019re picking us off.\u201d\n\nIn an email, an HHS spokesperson said the agency does not discriminate: \u201c[HHS] substance use programs offer treatment and recovery support for people, regardless of substance use duration.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nAfter the horror of watching her boyfriend taken away in an ambulance, Loretta wandered through downtown Austin. Near APD HQ, in the area where police had arrested their suspect earlier, she was offered crack that her friend insisted came from a reliable source. Stressed and scared, she took a hit.\n\n\u201cI started getting a headache right away, like oh, my God, I\u2019ve got a migraine or something. And I started throwing up,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018Call the police, I\u2019m sick.\u2019\u201d\n\nLoretta didn\u2019t lose consciousness, but she was vomiting as police questioned her. Eventually, she was taken to a hospital. She would be among the survivors.\n\nToday, Loretta says that she gets test strips from harm reduction organizations, which quietly distribute them despite state law, and she gives them to friends. But, at the time, she knew little about them. Organizations that distribute strips generally can\u2019t use grant money for their purchase, and government agencies, like ATCEMS, don\u2019t distribute them.\n\nBack in 2023, it seemed Texas was poised to legalize the strips. Before that year\u2019s legislative session, Abbott said he supported allowing the tests, and legislators in both chambers introduced bills to legalize equipment for checking a range of drugs. One by Houston-area Republican Tom Oliverson, which was limited to fentanyl strips only, sailed through the House.\n\nOliverson, an anesthesiologist who has prescribed fentanyl to patients, said he\u2019d heard from family members of people who purchased black-market pills without knowing they included the powerful opioid.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s literally like stepping on a landmine,\u201d Oliverson told the Observer. \u201cYou heard a click and the next thing you know, you were gone. Nothing you could have done could have saved you. You didn\u2019t know it was there, right? Except for the fact that there are test strips.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org", "article_id": "b841c7f3-4a26-4201-bf64-1cca1a7895a1", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

In 2018, Texas saw 210 deaths associated with fentanyl, but that rose to 1,612 by 2021, according to the Department of State Health Services. In 2021, fentanyl was tied to 95% of all unintentional synthetic opioid deaths in the state, the agency says.\n\nTMA is tracking several measures that could help improve the state\u2019s crisis response by legalizing fentanyl test strips, increasing the state\u2019s supply of the opioid antidote naloxone, and easing physician use of Texas\u2019 prescription monitoring program (PMP). (See \u201cOpioid Bill Watch,\u201d right.)\n\nGovernor Abbott signaled his support for these bills during his Feb. 16 State of the State address, saying Texas must \u201cincrease the supply of lifesaving Narcan\u201d \u2013 a brand name for naloxone \u2013 \u201cso we can save more Texans who are ambushed by fentanyl.\u201d\n\nThe bills could be fast-tracked given Governor Abbott\u2019s declaration of the fentanyl crisis as an emergency item this session.\n\nMeanwhile, developments at the federal level also are paving the way toward solutions by increasing access to opioid disorder treatments and overdose-reversing drugs.\n\nIn addition, Texas\u2019 preliminary budget bills from both the House and the Senate include funding for licensing fees related to the PMP, which physicians are required by state law to consult when prescribing certain opioids and other controlled substances.\n\nPhysicians don\u2019t have to pay to access the PMP, but they do have to pay fees to keep their electronic health record integrated with the program. Michelle Romero, TMA associate vice president of public affairs, says the $7 million budget item could help remove what has amounted to an \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d for physicians over the past few years.\n\nTestifying on TMA\u2019s behalf, Mesquite pain management specialist C.M. Schade, MD, endorsed these interventions, along with other TMA recommendations, during a Sept. 13 interim meeting of the House Committee on Public Health. He is a member of TMA\u2019s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018opioid crisis\u2019 is no longer just about prescription opioids,\u201d he testified, emphasizing that the main driver is illegally manufactured fentanyl. \u201cIt is time for us to reexamine our processes and change course.\u201d\n\nTMA\u2019s other recommendations include:\n\nInvesting in effective data mining software to compare pharmacy purchases with pharmacy PMP sales to spot illegal prescribing and dispensing;\n\nImproving education and prevention programs about opioids;\n\nExpanding mental health and substance use disorder services;\n\nImproving data collection to identify at-risk populations; and\n\nCreating community-based syringe service programs, which can connect people with addiction to the larger health care system for treatment and other services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal progress\n\nRecent federal efforts also could give states a boost in the fight.\n\nThe U.S. government recently ended a major restriction on prescribing buprenorphine, one of the most effective medications for treating opioid use disorder.\n\nPassage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 swept away the need for an \u201cX waiver\u201d for physicians or other health care professionals to be able to prescribe buprenorphine, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nSince 2000, physicians have been required to obtain an X waiver under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. Among other things, the waiver required physicians to take an eight-hour training program before being able to prescribe buprenorphine. Other health care professionals had to take 24 hours of training.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, it gave the DEA authority to visit physician practices unannounced to specifically audit buprenorphine prescribing,\u201d said Carlos Tirado, MD, an Austin addiction psychiatrist and member of TMA\u2019s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health. \u201cIt created an adversarial environment in which physicians experiencing these DEA on-site practice audits often felt that they were being treated like criminals for treating a chronic medical condition.\u201d\n\nA 2021 rule change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services allowed physicians to opt out of the eight-hour training \u2013 though they still had to obtain the waiver and face audits. Also, those who opted out could treat only 30 patients with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act eliminates X waivers entirely, including special audits or restrictions on the number of patients, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\n\u201cAll practitioners who have a current DEA registration that includes Schedule III authority, may now prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder in their practice if permitted by applicable state law and SAMHSA encourages them to do so,\u201d the agency said.\n\nComplex cases of opioid addiction \u2013 like those with underlying problems with mental health or infectious disease \u2013 will still require input from addiction specialists, Dr. Tirado says. But eliminating the X waiver will make it easier for primary care physicians to initiate care or maintain care for patients who are stable on the medication.\n\n\u201cRestricting buprenorphine during the worst opioid crisis of our lifetimes probably contributed to making the opioid epidemic worse,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, as of press time in early March, two panels of medical experts had unanimously recommended to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that Narcan nasal spray, which can reverse an opioid overdose, be made available over the counter \u2013 a move Texas physicians have long championed. A final FDA decision was still pending.\n\nThe goal of the FDA panels\u2019 recommendation is to make the naloxone spray cheaper and more widely available so that more people can prevent opioid overdoses, Dr. Schade says.\n\nAn opioid overdose slows respiration until a person stops breathing, he says.\n\n\u201cAfter that, you have about five minutes before you\u2019re brain dead,\u201d Dr. Schade said. \u201cWhat that means is that you have to have [Narcan] rapidly available.\u201d\n\nPharmacies in most states \u2013 including Texas \u2013 are allowed to use a standing order from a physician to provide the medication to anyone who wants to buy it. But people still must pay whatever copay their insurance requires, and that can drive up the price, he adds.\n\nMaking Narcan available over the counter should lower the cost for consumers and make the medication as common as other over-the-counter medications.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s over the counter, the price will go down, and people will have it,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough education, it will be widely available in first-aid kits and be omnipresent.\u201d\n\nNarcan nasal spray poses no safety risk for the public, even for children, adds Dr. Tirado.\n\n\u201cNaloxone is incredibly safe,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s one of the safest medications out there. There\u2019s really no reason this shouldn\u2019t be over the counter.\u201d\n\nThe recommendation for Narcan\u2019s over-the-counter use came from a joint meeting of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee. The unanimous vote by the committees\u2019 19 members was nonbinding, but FDA typically follows recommendations by its expert medical panels.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org", "article_id": "145c3f13-e333-4468-8308-6773297395f7", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Greg Abbott on Thursday announced a $10 million fentanyl awareness campaign and plan to distribute doses of Narcan to every county in the state.\n\nAbbott said the state\u2019s \u201cOne Pill Kills\u201d multimedia campaign is designed to warn Texans about the unlawful use of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. In addition, the governor said the Texas Division of Emergency Management will be delivering a total of 20,000 doses of the overdose-reversing medication, naloxone, more commonly known as Narcan, to all 254 counties in Texas.\n\n\u201cFentanyl is killing more Texans than ever before,\u201d Abbott said at the \u201cOne Pill Kills\u201d summit on Thursday. \u201cLast year, 2,012 Texans lost their lives because of fentanyl. When you think about it, that is an average of more than five people in Texas losing their lives every day because of fentanyl.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Narcan doses each come as a nasal spray and will be distributed to sheriff offices in each county.\n\nOverdose deaths involving fentanyl in Texas rose nearly 400%, from 333 people dying in fiscal year 2019 to 1,662 dying in fiscal year 2021. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 5,000 people have died of drug overdoses between July 2021 and July 2022.\n\n\u201cEach branch of our administration is informing Texans about this crisis and how they can avoid falling victim to deadly fentanyl,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nThe multimillion-dollar \u201cOne Pill Kills\u201d campaign, led by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, will include public service announcements aired on television and radio stations and published online. The public awareness campaign will be paid for with the help of the federal Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment and Recovery Services Block Grant, according to Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for Texas Health and Human Services. The funding of the Narcan doses will come from the state\u2019s settlement proceeds with opioid manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u201cToday, we wrote the next chapter in our war on fentanyl by arming Texans with the tools to be able to save lives,\u201d said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Nationwide, the CDC reported that more than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2021, the last year with available data. Synthetic opioids were responsible for 71,000 of those deaths, and they were largely from fentanyl.\n\nMakers of illegal drugs often use fentanyl as a booster for other drugs they are selling. A majority of people who die of overdoses are taking illicit drugs but have no idea that those drugs have been laced with fentanyl.\n\nA year ago, Abbott said he wants to change Texas law to classify deaths caused by fentanyl overdose as poisonings, which would allow for stiffer penalties \u2014 potentially including murder charges \u2014 for those who knowingly sell drugs mixed with fentanyl to people who use drugs. He also said he supports decriminalizing fentanyl testing strips, reversing his previous opposition to the idea.\n\nIn this legislative session, state Sen. Nathan Johnson, D-Dallas, and state Sen. Bob Hall, R-Edgewood, filed Senate Bill 86 to decriminalize the use of testing strips and other methods used to detect fentanyl.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Senate has also approved two bills this session that could help achieve some of Abbott\u2019s goals when it comes to fighting the fentanyl crisis. Senate Bill 645 by Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, would open the door for prosecutors to deliver murder charges against people who make, sell and deliver fentanyl.\n\n\u201cI am proud to be here today with so many strong voices leading the fight against the fentanyl crisis in Texas communities,\u201d Abbott said at the Thursday event. \u201cTogether, we will save more innocent lives from being lost to the scourge of fentanyl.\"\n\nJoin The Texas Tribune at 3 p.m. Tuesday, April 11, for a panel discussion on combating opioid overdose deaths, moderated by Tribune politics reporter James Barrag\u00e1n.

Greg Abbott and bipartisan lawmakers, who see it as a way to save lives.\n\nBY JAMES BARRAG\u00c1N AND KAREN BROOKS HARPER\nAPRIL 27, 2023\nUPDATED: APRIL 28, 2023\nSHARE\nREPUBLISH\nAdvocates for a bill to legalize fentanyl test strips blamed state Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston \u2014 shown during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on April 3, 2019 \u2014 for committee delays on the legislation. \nCredit:\n Emree Weaver/The Texas Tribune\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nAdvocates for changing the state\u2019s drug policies took over Sen. Joan Huffman\u2019s Capitol office Thursday morning demanding her support for legislation that would legalize test strips that can detect fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is blamed for a rapidly growing number of overdose deaths.\n\nThe legislation has bipartisan support and the backing of Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who has made combating opioid overdose deaths a key issue this session. But the advocates say Huffman, a Houston Republican, is blocking the consideration of multiple bills to legalize the potentially lifesaving test strips.\n\n\u201cThis bill needs to move,\u201d said Paulette Soltani, director of organizing for the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance, which organized the protest. \u201cWe need everybody to support this basic harm-reduction tool.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nHuffman\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on her position on the bill.\n\nThe protest came as the legislative session, which ends on Memorial Day, hits its home stretch and a House-passed bill to legalize fentanyl test strips languishes in a Senate committee without a hearing. It also came as the House voted on a bill that would increase criminal penalties for people who sell or distribute fentanyl, including opening the door for prosecutors to charge those people with murder.\n\nThat legislation, a key bill for Republicans pursuing a \u201ctough on crime\u201d approach to the opioid epidemic, won final House approval Friday on a 124-21 vote \u2014 putting the legislation on track to become one of the first leadership priorities to reach the governor\u2019s desk.\n\nHuffman\u2019s companion bill, which is nearly identical, passed the Senate unanimously last month.\n\nHouse Bill 6, by Rep. Craig Goldman, R-Fort Worth, advanced on Thursday just a few hours after a small group of chanting protesters crowded the entry to the House gallery overlooking the lawmakers at their desks and yelled \u201cNo more drug war!\u201d at lawmakers. The demonstrators were blocked at the gallery door by a handful of state troopers, and the tension ended after about five minutes.\n\nHB 6 would increase the penalties related to the sale and production of fentanyl by classifying overdoses from the drug as \u201cpoisonings,\u201d triggering murder charges for those convicted of giving someone a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\n\u201cIf you have not had a family member die from fentanyl overdose, if you don\u2019t know anyone who has died from fentanyl overdose, consider yourself lucky. Because you\u2019re in the minority,\u201d Goldman said during the debate. \u201cOn behalf of all our family members who have died innocently by taking medication laced with fentanyl, we\u2019re here today to tell the people who deal that drug \u2026 we\u2019re coming after you.\u201d\n\nProponents say the measure would help address a growing crisis in the state by holding dealers accountable and giving prosecutors more tools to charge those who manufacture and distribute the drug.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBut opponents, who said the policy would prolong a 50-year, trillion-dollar war on drugs, argue that it would not fix the problem and would discourage people from seeking help for someone suffering from an overdose. Drug policy experts say the move to charge people who sell or make fentanyl with murder has backfired in other states, leading to more overdose deaths and criminal charges for family and friends who were present when the victim took the drug.\n\n\u201cNo study has ever shown that increasing penalties for drug usage has ever reduced drug usage in people who have a drug addiction,\u201d said Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably already decided how you\u2019re going to vote, and that\u2019s fine. What I\u2019m here to do today is speak against the continuation of the drug war and the continued incarceration of people for drug addiction instead of providing them the help and care they need to not be addicts.\u201d\n\nThe bill \u2014 supported by Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and House Speaker Dade Phelan \u2014 now goes to the Senate.\n\nThe fentanyl test strip bill, however, is on a more tenuous track.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Senate roadblock on House Bill 362 has baffled supporters, who see the legalization of fentanyl test strips as a smart public health approach in a state that has historically responded to drug epidemics through punitive measures. The bill has the support of top GOP leaders like Abbott, who had previously opposed the policy but said in December that he had developed a \u201cbetter understanding\u201d that the state needs to take more drastic action to save lives.\n\nThe bill would remove fentanyl test strips from the state\u2019s list of drug paraphernalia, letting people avoid a potential misdemeanor charge for possessing one. Currently, possession of drug paraphernalia \u2014 items used to consume illegal substances that can include fentanyl testing strips, used syringes and pipes \u2014 is a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500.\n\nHuffman was not in her office Thursday morning when a group of about 20 protesters entered, chanting \u201cHuffman lies, people die!\u201d and \u201cShame on her!\u201d Huffman has not publicly stated her opposition to the bill, but she is on the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, where the bill has sat idle since early April. Houston Democratic Sen. John Whitmire, who leads the committee, told The Dallas Morning News on Wednesday that he supports the bill but that it does not have the backing of Republicans on the committee, who make up the panel\u2019s majority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received calls that she is lobbying in committee against the bill,\u201d Soltani told Huffman\u2019s staff. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving until we learn her position.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nHuffman has led on other bills related to fentanyl, including a push to make it easier to report overdoses to public health authorities. As the Senate\u2019s lead budget writer, she inserted $18 million over the next two years to help the state provide the public with more medications like naloxone \u2014 which can be administered through the nose with products like Narcan and others, or injected more directly into the bloodstream through muscles \u2014 that help reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\nChanting \u201cGet Huffman on the phone,\u201d the protesters gave Huffman\u2019s staff a petition signed by 700 people who support the bill. After about 15 minutes, DPS troopers escorted them out of Huffman\u2019s office.\n\nThe other three Republican senators on the committee \u2014 Pete Flores of Pleasanton, Phil King of Weatherford and Paul Bettencourt of Houston \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor those who want to change the state\u2019s drug policies, the test strip legislation is seen as a small step in the right direction that falls short of other needed action, such as decriminalizing tools that could test for other emerging drugs, like xylazine, an animal tranquilizer which is being mixed into drugs to make them more potent and can cause wounds of scaly, dead tissue.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe bill\u2019s Republican sponsors, like Rep. Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress, are opposed to using the bill to expand the list of drug paraphernalia that would be legalized. As written, HB 362 has not received major opposition, even from law enforcement groups that usually oppose the decriminalization of drug paraphernalia under the argument that could lead to more permissive drug policies.\n\n\u201cThis is the one thing we could pass in Texas because we have the support of conservatives, and [Huffman\u2019s] holding it up,\u201d said Cate Graziani, executive director of the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance.\n\nOliverson said he remains optimistic that the bill can pass and said his conversations with Senate leaders have been positive.\n\n\u201cThey understand that fentanyl is a different category of drug,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to win minds and hearts. It\u2019s part of what we do here.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nRep. James Talarico, an Austin Democrat and a co-author of the bill, was more forceful.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll sleep at night if we don\u2019t pass this bipartisan bill to save lives,\u201d he said.\n\nTexans seeking help for substance use can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s free help line at 800-662-4357. They can also access services in their region through the Texas Health and Human Services website.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to welcome you Sept. 21-23 to the 2023 Texas Tribune Festival, our multiday celebration of big, bold ideas about politics, public policy and the day\u2019s news \u2014 all taking place just steps away from the Texas Capitol.

The origin of the deadly spike in overdoses and the people responsible still remain a mystery.\n\nHowever, in the back of Brown\u2019s mind, he knew that if he hadn\u2019t spent the past couple of years pushing for overdose reversal drugs like Narcan to be available to the public, specifically in restaurants and bars, the situation might have been much worse.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cThe number of overdoses was extraordinary,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut dozens of people who overdosed didn\u2019t die, and that is the only good I have seen come out of this because if this happened three years ago, the death toll most likely would have been much higher.\u201d\n\nTravis County is in the midst of a drug epidemic, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down anytime soon as fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid often mixed with other substances, is ravaging the state\u2019s capital city.\n\nTexas Department of State Health Services data shows that overdose deaths in Travis County are higher than in other urban Texas counties.\n\nIn 2023, Travis County recorded 440 accidental drug-related deaths, or 33 deaths per 100,000 residents. That\u2019s higher than Dallas County, which reported 25 deaths per 100,000 residents last year, Tarrant and Bexar counties, which saw 23 deaths per 100,000, and Harris County, with 21 deaths per 100,000 people.\n\nThe rise in both the illegal use of fentanyl and now the manufacturing of counterfeit prescription drugs that contain this lab-made drug has made this a particularly deadly problem across the nation.\n\nFrom August 2022 to August 2023, there were an estimated 5,566 drug-related deaths in Texas, and 45% of them involved fentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Texas Health and Human Services reported last year that, on average, five Texans die every day from fentanyl poisoning.\n\nThe state\u2019s drug overdose deaths increased by more than 75% in the past five years. The number of deaths involving fentanyl has steadily climbed since 2014, from 3.7% of 2,111 drug-related deaths to 44% of 4,931 drug-related deaths in 2022, according to a report from the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nThe drug overdose death rate in Texas was at 17 deaths per 100,000 residents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in 2021, the last year with available data. This number is significantly lower when compared to similar states like California, at 27 per 100,000, and Florida, at 38 per 100,000.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is predicting record numbers of drug poisonings across the nation for 2023, with their latest estimate for the 12-month period ending June 2023 at 112,323 lives lost. Nearly 70% of these drug poisonings are from fentanyl.\n\nEarlier this year, Texas launched \u201cOne Pill Kills,\u201d a multimedia campaign designed to warn Texans about the dangers of fentanyl. Lawmakers last year also passed House Bill 6, increasing the penalties related to the sale and production of fentanyl by classifying overdoses from the drug as \u201cpoisonings,\u201d triggering murder charges for those convicted of giving someone a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nLt. Patrick Eastlick, for the Austin Police Department\u2019s organized crime unit, said their department began conducting undercover operations and targeted enforcement to combat fentanyl dealing in downtown, North Austin, and portions of South Austin.\n\nEastlick said these operations uncovered that fentanyl is being mixed into crack cocaine, methamphetamine, and even marijuana by drug dealers to increase the volume of their product and their profit. He said when the synthetic opioid, which is 100 times more potent than morphine, isn\u2019t mixed correctly, it can trigger overdoses.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning to us to see fentanyl not only being mixed with marijuana but all these substances that are being mixed with it,\u201d Eastlick said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a concern that all people should have when consuming narcotics.\u201d\n\nIn its annual report, the Travis County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office said this overdose spike was a growing trend. In 2022, 417 Travis County residents died from drug-related overdoses, or 31 deaths per 100,000 people. It marked the first time that overdoses were the leading cause of accidental death in the county since 2011.\n\nThat year, 27% of the accidental deaths were people in their 30s, and 21% were in their 20s.\n\n\u201cThis problem affects all parts of Travis County. It affects the unhoused and the suburbs,\u201d said Travis County District Attorney spokesperson Ismael Martinez.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nIn 2021, the district attorney\u2019s office created a community-based strategy to raise awareness and provide funding and access to life-saving drugs like Narcan to bars and restaurants where overdoses happen regularly. The effort was eventually taken over by the county, and the City of Austin started to pitch in.\n\nBrown said in his State of the County address in April that the state has failed to expand substance use treatment, leaving counties to tackle the problem. He said Travis County allocated $860,000 last year to provide Narcan kits, methadone \u2014 a medication that reduces opioid craving and withdrawal \u2014 and peer support services. The money comes from the Texas Opioid Abatement Fund Council, formed in 2021 to ensure that money recovered from the statewide opioid settlement agreements is used to tackle the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cWe listened to the community when they came to us a couple of years ago and asked us to do more. And since then, we\u2019ve given out almost 15,000 doses of Narcan around the county,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe city has done the same and more. While the number of overdoses is increasing, so are the number of overdoses that are reversed by Narcan.\u201d\n\nBrown said Travis County officials are focusing on preventing overdose deaths rather than trying to stop the flow of drugs.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cI really want to put our county\u2019s efforts towards continuing to improve education about how every overdose death is preventable if you use Narcan or have Narcan available,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown also believes the best way to stem the opioid epidemic in Travis County is to address the lack of mental health resources in the area.\n\n\u201cOur community has a lot of unmet mental health needs, and unmet mental health needs and substance use disorder go hand in hand,\u201d Brown said.\n\nDisclosure: Emergent, the maker of Narcan, has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

But locating Narcan, which can reverse the effects of an overdose quickly, has been tough for Texans since it was made available without a prescription last year.\n\nBY STEPHEN SIMPSON\nMARCH 7, 2024\nUPDATED: 3 PM CENTRAL\nSHARE\nREPUBLISH\nInconsistent practices from pharmacy to pharmacy and slow resupply times can make Narcan, which can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, hard to find. \nCredit:\n Eddie Gaspar/The Texas Tribune\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nWhen the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone an over-the-counter medication last summer, health care advocates praised the removal of the prescription barrier as an effective tool to prevent fentanyl deaths.\n\nThat is, if you can find it.\n\nA February report from Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy found that of the 156 pharmacies they contacted, 71 percent of the Houston pharmacies kept it behind the pharmacists\u2019 counters or were entirely out of the product.\n\nPharmacies typically stock it in the nasal spray version of the life-saving drug, called Narcan. When used, Narcan can quickly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. It\u2019s not cheap. A box containing two doses of two nasal sprays goes for $43.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBut inconsistent practices from pharmacy to pharmacy and slow resupply times can make Narcan a problematic drug to find.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding Narcan sales,\u201d said Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy. \u201cSome places are sold out of it because of the demand. While others still keep it behind the counter to prevent it from being stolen or don\u2019t carry it at all.\u201d\n\nFrom August 2022 to 2023, there were an estimated 5,566 drug-related deaths in Texas, 45% of which involved the synthetic opioid fentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Texas Health and Human Services reported last year that, on average, five Texans die every day from fentanyl poisoning.\n\nThe rise in both the illegal use of the drug and now the manufacturing of counterfeit prescription drugs that contain fentanyl has made this a particularly deadly problem. But access to the quick-acting Narcan is inconsistent in Texas and nationwide.\n\nStudents at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy called major retail pharmacies in 48 zip codes \u2013 including 22 in high poverty zip codes \u2013 to ask about availability, brand, price, and location within the store. The group contacted a variety of retailers including Walgreens, CVS, H-E-B, Kroger, Walmart, Costco, and Sam\u2019s Club pharmacies over several months in 2023.\n\nThe report found most pharmacies contacted in the Houston area had some version of naloxone, but 71% of them still kept it behind the counter. Of those reported carrying naloxone, 45% said pharmacist assistance is required, 26% said cashier assistance is needed, and three pharmacies even mentioned ID was required for purchase.\n\nNarcan can usually be found on the websites of these pharmacies. The FDA\u2019s decision to make naloxone, or Narcan, available without a prescription was to make this life-saving drug easily available. However, the price point for Narcan, roughly $22.50 per dose, usually means retail pharmacies will lock it up out of fear of it being stolen, reducing the odds someone will buy it because they will have to ask for assistance.\n\n\u201cThis is the opposite of what is supposed to be occurring. When you put something behind the counter, it automatically makes people less likely to ask for it. It makes them think they need a prescription to ask for it,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nA random visit to 15 pharmacies in Austin revealed the confusion surrounding the drug\u2019s location or availability. Pharmacists, often busy with customers, had a few moments to quickly point to the last area where the Narcan might be located or mention they were sold out of the product.\n\nIn northwest Austin\u2019s Allandale neighborhood, the H-E-B has two boxes of Narcan located on the shelf next to pain pills. Meanwhile, the Walgreens across the street has an empty Narcan display in front of their pharmacy counter.\n\nAt the same time, the Tarrytown Pharmacy northwest of downtown Austin offered customers multiple ways to obtain Narcan while in the store, such as picking it up from the aisle or having a pharmacist prescribe one at the desk to allow for insurance to cover the price. A Walgreen\u2019s southwest of downtown, on Riverside Drive had no Narcan in stock.\n\nThe Texas Tribune reached out multiple times for comment from the Texas Pharmacy Association. The group did not immediately comment on the inconsistent availability of Narcan.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTexas is not alone in this problem. Mississippi Today reported more than 40% of the state\u2019s pharmacies do not carry naloxone, despite a 2017 standing order from the state that allows pharmacists to dispense naloxone with or without a prescription.\n\nAccording to a March 2023 report by the Reagan-Udall Foundation, 45% of the 17 million doses of naloxone in the United States in 2021 were distributed outside retail pharmacies and health care facilities. Local health departments, harm reduction organizations, first responders, schools, and other community organizations distribute millions of naloxone doses annually.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t what was envisioned when Narcan was made available to the public,\u201d Harris said.\n\nLast year, President Joe Biden, in partnership with the Ad Council, the nonprofit organization that produces and promotes public service announcements, launched a fentanyl and naloxone awareness campaign following the FDA\u2019s approval of Narcan for over-the-counter sales. The campaign, which includes digital billboards and social media posts from college athletes and content creators, is meant to teach young people how to use and find naloxone in their communities as opioid deaths continue to rise across the country.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTexas Comptroller Glen Hegar announced on Thursday that a $25 million grant was being made available through the Opioid Abatement Fund Council to distribute naloxone. The grant will be awarded to one entity to implement the program statewide. The funding is open to governmental entities, nonprofit organizations, and businesses. The Opioid Abatement Fund Council was formed in 2021 to ensure money recovered from the statewide opioid settlement agreements is allocated toward stopping the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cGiven the tragic trend of fentanyl poisonings occurring across Texas, especially among school-aged youth, wide availability of naloxone can literally save lives,\u201d Hegar said in a statement.\n\nLast year, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, launched the state\u2019s multimedia campaign last year known as \u201cOne Pill Kills\u201d to emphasize the importance of Narcan and the dangers of the synthetic opioid known as fentanyl, a drug 50 times more potent than heroin.\n\nThe CDC also reported that in 2022, an estimated 43% of drug-related deaths nationally occur with a potential bystander present.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Rice University report also noted that 17% of the pharmacies they contacted didn\u2019t carry naloxone of any kind, and four zip codes contained multiple pharmacies without the drug, all having poverty rates of less than 10 percent.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons we heard for not carrying naloxone was the perception their clientele didn\u2019t need it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe are supposed to be encouraging everyone to have Narcan. It\u2019s meant to be as common as a fire extinguisher.\u201d\n\nKristen Clancy, a pharmacist and the director of the Houston Recovery Initiative, a volunteer network of prevention, intervention, treatment and post-treatment services for those with substance abuse problems, said she doesn\u2019t think this is a case of pharmacies being negligent; they just don\u2019t have the time to be educated on the problems in their community. She said that is why she has spent the past couple of years getting Narcan into the hands of independent pharmacies in Galveston County.\n\n\u201cWhen we put Narcan in an independent pharmacy, the pharmacist told us they didn\u2019t want to do it. I told him your county is the second highest per capita for overdose deaths in the state, and your city is the third highest per capita. Why wouldn\u2019t you want this? He had no idea and was completely on board once they learned,\u201d Clancy said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nJennifer Ruffcorn, a Texas Health and Human Services spokesperson, said their agency hasn\u2019t notified pharmacies to tell them they should be selling over the counter. She also said the agency doesn\u2019t have statistics on naloxone availability or what pharmacies currently sell naloxone over the counter.\n\nNaloxone can be a vital piece to solving the opioid crisis in Texas, but Rice\u2019s Harris said for this to happen, there will need to be some changes made by and for pharmacists.\n\n\u201cPharmacies are one of the most accessible points of care. You get flu shots and pick up your medicine there, and other things. If we can put Narcan more in the public eye, then people will start to take more interest in it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut our pharmacists are also facing their own challenges. Pharmacies have the potential to be great community care providers, but we got to support them.\u201d\n\nFor pharmacist Julie Bennett, who works at the independent Tarrytown Pharmacy in Austin. making the opioid-reversal medication known as naloxone widely available is vital.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBennett spends the free days her employer gives to pharmacists to do community outreach to search for available naloxone supplies. She searches online, contacts suppliers, and is always trying to find a new way to get more naloxone products to the public, including giving away some of their stockpile of Narcan to college students for free at events.\n\n\u201cThe key is we have the staff in place to allow me to do this,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWhen I was working at CVS, there was no time. I was alone, the phones were ringing, and people were in the drive-thru. It\u2019s not easy for pharmacists right now, and I think that is holding things back when it comes to access to naloxone.\u201d\n\nTime is something most pharmacies around Texas have in short supply as the industry is dealing with staffing shortages.\n\nCVS, Walgreens, and Walmart announced early last year the need to reduce hours to help manage the workload with fewer available pharmacists. Later that year, workers at some of the nation\u2019s biggest pharmacy chains, Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid, pledged to start a \u201cpharmageddon\u201d by coming together and calling in sick for one day to demand better working conditions. This grassroots movement came after two separate protests by Walgreens employees nationwide and CVS employees in at least a dozen Kansas stores.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nClancy, the Houston pharmacist, said the work environment around pharmacies, especially busy retail ones, is challenging right now, making checking how much Narcan is in stock at the pharmacy a very low priority.\n\n\u201cYou ask pharmacists to dispense 400 to 600 prescriptions daily with limited staff. You might get one lunch break, but you have to spend that time catching up on work,\u201d she said. \u201cThese corporate pharmacies discovered during COVID-19 that you could push these pharmacists to the brink with a limited staff. You could add shots and vaccines on top of filling prescriptions, and now you are asking them to keep track of one more product.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Emergent, Walmart, CVS, H-E-B, Rice University, Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy and Texas Pharmacy Association have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Greg Abbott and state lawmakers have taken a tough-on-drugs approach to the fentanyl crisis, primarily pushing efforts to increase criminal penalties.\n\nBY JAMES BARRAG\u00c1N\nMARCH 15, 2023\n4 PM CENTRAL\nSHARE\nREPUBLISH\nTablets of the opioid-based hydrocodone at a pharmacy in Portsmouth, Ohio, on June 21, 2017. \nCredit:\n REUTERS/Bryan Woolston\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nThe Texas Senate on Wednesday unanimously passed a key bill of the Legislature\u2019s war on opioids that would increase the penalties related to the sale and production of fentanyl, by classifying overdoses from the drug as \u201cpoisonings.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 645 by Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, would achieve one of Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s legislative priorities by opening the door for prosecutors to charge people who make, sell and deliver fentanyl with murder.\n\nThe bill would also increase the penalty for making or delivering less than 1 gram of fentanyl from a state jail felony to a third-degree felony. If a person dies from an overdose as a result of that manufacturing or delivery of the drug, that penalty is escalated to a second-degree felony. In 2021, Huffman authored a law that increased penalties for manufacturing or delivering more than 1 gram of fentanyl.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cWe have tragically learned the extent of how dangerous fentanyl is and how even under 1 gram is so dangerous,\u201d Huffman said on Wednesday, while introducing her \u201cCombating Fentanyl\u201d bill. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that fentanyl is flooding our borders. It is absolutely without a doubt killing our citizens on a daily basis. And it\u2019s time that we take a comprehensive approach to combat this.\u201d\n\nJust 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be a lethal dose depending on a person\u2019s body size, tolerance and past usage, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nAbbott and state lawmakers have taken a tough-on-drugs approach to the fentanyl crisis, primarily pushing efforts to increase criminal penalties. That strategy has been criticized by some drug policy experts who say such policies only criminalize drug users instead of offering them help with addiction.\n\nThe move to charge people who sell or make fentanyl with murder has backfired in other states, leading to more overdose deaths and the charging of family and friends who were present when the victim took the drug.\n\nOverdose deaths involving fentanyl in the state rose nearly 400%, from 333 people dying in fiscal year 2019 to 1,662 in fiscal year 2021. In Texas, the CDC predicts that more than 5,000 people died of drug overdoses between July 2021 and July 2022.\n\nFentanyl overdose deaths in Texas have gained attention as news outlets have covered stories of young teens and adults who die from fentanyl overdoses, sometimes thinking that they were using other drugs like adderall, which is commonly prescribed for people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\nHuffman\u2019s bill would also stiffen penalties for making, delivering or possessing larger quantities of fentanyl. Having between 200 and 400 grams would be a first-degree felony, which could lead to between 10 years and life in prison as well as a fine of up to $100,000. Having more than 400 grams would also be a first-degree felony punishable by at least 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.\n\nBut if approved by lawmakers, charging suspects with murder could still be a difficult outcome for law enforcement officials. Some of the challenges include questions about how prosecutors could prove whether the person selling or distributing the drug knew that they were selling something that included fentanyl. And those who sell or distribute the drug aren\u2019t usually the same people who manufacture the drugs.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cIt may be that they find it\u2019s easier to prosecute under the other statute that I passed that would make it a second-degree felony,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there may be extraordinary cases where it\u2019s clear cut and the prosecutor then could have this tool to file for first-degree felony.\u201d\n\nHuffman made an exception in the law for medical professionals who prescribe fentanyl as treatment. She also changed the law so that death certificates do not classify as \u201cfentanyl poisonings\u201d deaths in which fentanyl is detected in the body but there is another clear cause of death.\n\nSeparately, the Senate also approved Senate Bill 1319 by Huffman, which would make it mandatory for law enforcement, first responders or other people who respond to emergencies to provide overdose information to a governmental entity that maintains a digital overdose mapping system. Many areas use tools like odmap.org to track overdose hot spots and deploy resources to those areas. Supporters of such programs say they are a needed tool to fight overdoses in the state.\n\nUnder current Texas law, some state entities do not have liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to share overdose information in efforts to identify overdose hot spots to deploy resources to those areas. The bill allows emergency responders to provide limited parts of that information without fear of legal retribution.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe bill would allow emergency responders to share the date and time of the overdose incident, the approximate location of the incident, whether an opioid antagonist like naloxone was administered and the outcome of the patient. It does not allow for the sharing of the victim\u2019s personal information.\n\nThe two bills received unanimous support in the Texas Senate, with one senator absent.

Greg Abbott\u2019s support in the past \u2014 have failed in the Senate.\n\nThis year, legislation to legalize these test strips faces similar challenges.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a different stream of thought that feels like if you give an inch, you give a mile, and that any sort of lessening of prohibition stance is sort of giving up and giving over to drug use,\u201d said Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nHouse Bill 1644, by state Rep. Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress, would remove testing strips for fentanyl and xylazine, a veterinary sedative also known as \u201ctranq,\u201d from the list of banned drug paraphernalia.

One line indicates fentanyl is present, and two lines indicate a negative result.\n\nThis is the second legislative session in a row that Oliverson has tried to get his bill passed. Both times, his legislation didn\u2019t get a committee hearing in the Senate. With less than four weeks left in the legislative session, his bill this session hasn\u2019t yet been considered in the Senate Criminal Justice Committee.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nOliverson, in his speech from the House floor, suggested that Senate lawmakers fear that legalizing the strips would mean that people would start \u201cusing drugs to their heart\u2019s content safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want every person in Texas who is struggling with addiction to get the help they need. But I can\u2019t fix that if they are dead,\u201d Oliverson told lawmakers last month when his bill passed.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who oversees the Senate, did not return a request for comment nor did the criminal justice committee chair, Sen. Pete Flores, R-Pleasanton. Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, credited by drug policy advocates last legislative session for blocking fentanyl testing strips from a hearing, didn\u2019t comment on whether she supports legalization.\n\n\u201cThe structural nature of the Senate, where the lieutenant governor has the power to decide whether a bill gets a hearing or not, can be quite a big hurdle,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTravis County Judge Andy Brown said the delay in legalizing fentanyl testing strips is only costing lives with each passing year.\n\n\u201cOur fight against the number one cause of accidental death in Travis County is hampered by the fact that we haven\u2019t legalized fentanyl test strips in Texas,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAdvantages of fentanyl strips\n\nEarly last year, a rash of over 70 overdoses rocked Travis County in a span of three days, killing more than nine people. However, more deaths could have occurred if the county and the state hadn\u2019t made efforts to get overdose reversal drugs like Narcan and naloxone to the general public last legislative session.\n\nTo combat the growing number of fentanyl overdose deaths in Texas, state lawmakers in 2023 launched a $10 million fentanyl awareness campaign and plan to distribute doses of Narcan to every county in the state.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cI also get the sense that publicity campaigns that we have done and that the state has done have helped get the education out there, too,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown said Travis County, despite the harrowing encounter last year, saw a decline in fentanyl related deaths, dropping by 36%, from 279 in 2023 to 179 in 2024.\n\nA Texas Harm Reduction Alliance drop-in center in South Austin on May 5, 2025. \nCredit:\n Leila Saidane for The Texas Tribune\n\nDuring this same period, deaths from fentanyl overdose statewide dropped 14%, to 5,070 in 2024.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if this is a long-term decline. Certainly, it's an encouraging development that we hope to see continue,\u201d Harris said, pointing out that 87,000 deaths are still a lot.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nA dip doesn\u2019t mean a complete decline as the drug market is unpredictable. This is why drug policy advocates and others are clamoring for the legalization of drug testing strips, which are cheaper to stock than Narcan and can keep someone from using fentanyl in the first place.\n\nIn December 2022, Abbott announced his support for fentanyl testing strips as he believed the opioid crisis had gone too far. Attempts to contact Abbott to see if he still supports testing strips were not returned. Abbott did not respond to a request for comment on whether he still supports legalization.\n\n\u201cI think we would reduce the number of deaths that we\u2019re seeing in the state of Texas if we just made test strips legal,\u201d Brown said.\n\nUncertain future\n\nMaggie Luna, executive director of the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance, an Austin-based nonprofit that does outreach and operates a drop-in center for people who might need Narcan, condoms, bandages, and more, has seen firsthand the demand for fentanyl testing strips.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTheir organization can\u2019t legally buy testing strips but accepts tests donated to them from other states.\n\n\u201cPeople are always asking for fentanyl testing strips and xylazine test strips,\u201d Luna said.\n\nThe Texas Harm Reduction Center distributes Narcan and other supplies to clients. \nCredit:\n Leila Saidane for The Texas Tribune\n\nThe Texas Harm Reduction Alliance has been on the front-lines of this fight against drug-related deaths, reversing more than 300 overdoses in 2024 alone with Narcan, Luna said.\n\nIf fentanyl use continues, Luna is concerned about it worsening because of federal funding cuts to substance abuse programs, Texas lawmakers\u2019 attempt to ban intoxicating substances like hemp and kratom, and the economic downturn, which notoriously leads to spikes in drug usage.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors.

As part of the Legislature\u2019s war on opioids, House Bill 6 would classify overdoses from fentanyl as \u201cpoisonings.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the Senate on a 30-1 vote Tuesday. Three days later, the House accepted an amendment that had been added by the Senate, sending HB 6 to the governor.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott made combating opioid overdose deaths a key issue this session. HB 6 and its companion bill, Senate Bill 645, could effectively increase the penalties related to the sale and production of fentanyl.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, the author on the Senate version of the bill, introduced an amendment to the bill to include the term \u201cfentanyl poisoning\u201d as an alternative to \u201cfentanyl toxicity\u201d when medical examiners complete the death certificate.\n\nSen. Drew Springer applauded Huffman\u2019s addition to the bill. The Muenster Republican likened these deaths to poisonings because children who take Adderall laced with the much more potent drug don\u2019t know they\u2019re ingesting fentanyl.\n\nHB 6 passed the House with a 124-21 vote on April 28. The Senate had previously passed Huffman\u2019s version of the legislation in March.\n\nState Rep. Craig Goldman, R-Fort Worth, the author of HB 6, did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday on whether he would accept Huffman\u2019s amendment. If Goldman signals support for the Senate amendment, this legislation would be very close to becoming law.\n\nSupporters of the legislation argue the enhanced penalties give law enforcement more tools to help address a growing crisis in the state by holding dealers accountable.\n\nOver two years, from fiscal year 2019 to 2021, overdose deaths involving fentanyl in the state rose nearly 400%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 5,000 people in Texas died of drug overdoses between July 2021 and July 2022.\n\nThe issue has gained even more attention after the deaths of Texas teens and young adults from fentanyl overdoses, who thought they were taking the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder drug Adderall.\n\nCritics say increasing penalties for sale and production of fentanyl could discourage people from seeking help for someone suffering from an overdose.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors.

John Cornyn has made fentanyl crisis a priority\n\nThe Republican from Texas has combined attention to border issues with efforts to address deadly overdoses, including ideas that are opposed by some in his party, such as decriminalizing test strips.\n\nBY OLIVIA ALAFRIZ\nAUG. 14, 2023\n5 AM CENTRAL\nSHARE\nREPUBLISH\nU.S. Sen.

John Cornyn has made addressing the crisis a priority.\n\nCornyn, R-Texas, has introduced legislation to decriminalize fentanyl test strips and address drug trafficking at the U.S. border with Mexico, where criminal cartels are blamed for producing the vast majority of fentanyl.\n\nHe has led public gatherings to raise awareness about the dangers of fentanyl, which is commonly mixed with other drugs and is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin.\n\nAnd he remains haunted by the stories of parents who lost teenagers to fentanyl.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cI feel like a little boy trying to stick his finger in the dike and stop the flow, and I think we're running out of fingers to stick in the dike,\u201d Cornyn said in an interview.\n\nEarlier this year, Cornyn joined a roundtable discussion at a Hays County high school where six students in the school district have died of fentanyl poisoning since last summer. Several of the student\u2019s parents spoke as well.\n\n\u201cListening to parents who\u2019ve got these young, teenage kids with a lot of potential and full of life \u2014 just lose them to this drug \u2014 is heartbreaking,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cAnd so it's gotten me passionate about trying to do something about it.\u201d\n\nOne of those parents was Janel Rodriguez, whose 15-year-old son Noah Rodriguez died of a fentanyl overdose in August 2022. Rodriguez and her husband, Brandon Dunn, started a nonprofit, the Forever 15 Project, in response and have campaigned to raise awareness about the dangers of fentanyl.\n\nSpeaking with Cornyn, Rodriguez said, let her raise specific concerns about the fentanyl crisis, including barriers to treatment for youths.\n\n\u201cI felt heard for the first time,\u201d Rodriguez said in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just something that went in one ear and out the other,\u201d Rodriguez said, adding that Cornyn\u2019s office followed up on the conversation to get more information and to assure her that the senator was searching for solutions.\n\nCornyn has helped in other ways, Rodriguez said. When the Forever 15 Project sought to open a booth last month at a national conference of county officials in Austin, Rodriguez was discouraged to learn that it would have cost several thousand dollars. After reaching out to Cornyn, who was speaking at the conference, Rodriguez got word that she could have space for a booth at no cost.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cWe just cannot thank him enough for doing that for us. It probably was a small little thing on his end, but to us it was the world,\u201d she said.\n\nRodriguez and Dunn said they want policies that will address fentanyl-related deaths from multiple angles. Their organization focuses on harm reduction and raising awareness by speaking to high school students and handing out naloxone, an emergency overdose treatment, to parents and teenagers. But Dunn said another important step is addressing drug trafficking at the state\u2019s southern border.\n\nCornyn said he is trying to balance harm reduction and border security.\n\nLast month, Cornyn introduced bipartisan legislation to clarify federal law by specifying that fentanyl testing strips are not prohibited as drug paraphernalia. Because fentanyl is odorless and tasteless, its presence in other drugs can be unknown and fatal.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Texas House passed a similar bill in April, but the Senate declined to take action on House Bill 362 despite support for the change from Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nCritics have argued that test strips could encourage drug use. Cornyn disagreed, saying people who die from fentanyl usually don\u2019t know they\u2019ve consumed the drug if it\u2019s hidden in so-called \u201clook-alike pills.\u201d\n\nGrowing Republican support for allowing access to test strips represents a departure from the party\u2019s approach in the past, which focused more on trying to cut off the supply of drugs and less on reducing harm or decreasing risks associated with drug use.\n\nAlthough Cornyn has embraced test strips as one response, he believes the root of the problem remains drug trafficking across the Mexican border.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a multi-pronged approach to dealing with this, and it starts at the border,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cBecause once the fentanyl gets across the border, then we\u2019ve basically lost the battle.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, he introduced a bill with Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, that would allow the Department of Defense to train Mexican military forces to combat cartels and fentanyl trafficking in Mexico. That concept was included as an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that passed the Senate last month and will head to a conference committee to work out differences with the House-passed version.\n\nCornyn also introduced bipartisan legislation in July that would initiate a study of how drug trafficking organizations are financed, with the aim of helping the federal government financially stifle their operations.\n\nDuring an official trip to Mexico in March, Cornyn raised concerns about fentanyl trafficking with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who committed to working with China to stop shipments of fentanyl precursors to Mexico. These precursors are commonly processed by Mexican cartels, which facilitate the smuggling of drugs into the United States. In fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized nearly 22,000 pounds of fentanyl at the southern border.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThese measures are designed to prevent fentanyl from entering the country, but Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy scholar at Rice University, questioned whether such supply-side policies are effective.\n\nNeill Harris said past efforts, such as a crackdown on prescription opioids, showed that targeting supply had limited impact on drug abuse. \u201cSo I just don't really see how trying to crack down on the supply more is going to be different this time,\u201d she said, arguing that such policies also divert resources from preventive programs and treatment.\n\nCornyn dismissed concerns that border-first drug policies could be ineffective, blaming the Biden administration for failing to secure the border and allowing cartels to continue trafficking fentanyl into the United States.\n\n\u201cThe movement of migrants and drugs across the border are connected,\u201d Cornyn said, suggesting that by flooding the border with migrants, cartels enable drugs to get through.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nHowever, most fentanyl brought into the U.S. has been carried by U.S. citizens hired by the cartels. In 2022, 88% of those arrested for fentanyl trafficking were U.S. citizens according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.\n\nUltimately, Cornyn said, policymakers must take a comprehensive approach to the fentanyl crisis.\n\nFrom 2019-22, fentanyl deaths in Texas rose from 317 to 2,161, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\n\u201cYou can save lives.

It was designed to equip elementary and high school students with the skills to avoid drugs by standing up to peer pressure, but the program began to fade out of school districts across the country by the middle of the 2000s due to lack of results. This hasn\u2019t stopped other anti-drug programs from taking its place over the years as the country constantly scrambles to figure out how to solve the problem of youth drug abuse.\n\nNow, Texas is about to launch its latest anti-drug program in schools. Earlier this year, the state launched \u201cOne Pill Kills,\u201d a multimedia campaign designed to warn Texans about the unlawful use of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Reinforcing that message is a new law passed this year \u2014 House Bill 3908 \u2014 which requires fentanyl and drug abuse prevention instruction in Texas public schools for grades six through 12.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe measure \u2014 named Tucker\u2019s Law after Tucker Roe, a 19-year-old from Leander who died after taking a fentanyl-laced pill \u2014 went into effect in June and also requires Gov. Greg Abbott to designate a Fentanyl Poisoning Awareness Week in public schools.\n\nRoe died after he took what he thought was Percocet. The pill he purchased on social media was laced with fentanyl. His mother, Stefanie Turner, has been fighting ever since to have students educated about the dangers of fentanyl.\n\n\u201cHe told me the first time he was offered a pill, and it wasn\u2019t enough to save him. Having a loving family wasn\u2019t enough to save him,\u201d Turner said at the \u201cOne Pill Kills\u201d summit that was held in April. \u201cThis can happen to any family.\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s statement gets to the heart of why previous anti-drug instruction has had such meager results.\n\nStudies on the D.A.R.E. program in the 1990s pointed out that the anti-drug curriculum failed because it didn\u2019t acknowledge that youth drug use is often a symptom of a larger mental health problem.\n\nMany students who have a substance abuse disorder have had a negative experience in their childhood, and being taught healthy ways to manage their emotions could prevent them from turning to drugs.\n\nSome mental health providers in Texas worry the state\u2019s new emphasis on fentanyl education will be a repeat of the D.A.R.E. program mistakes made decades ago.\n\n\u201cKids have to understand why they are buying pills in the first place,\u201d said Kathleen Hassenfratz, a licensed professional counselor and board member for the nonprofit mental health organization the Engage and Heal Foundation, a group that formed in 2019 to raise mental health awareness.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nYouth mental health was declared a national emergency by pediatric experts across the country in 2021 as they warned that stress brought on by COVID-19 was leading to a rise in suspected suicide attempts among young people and an increase in hospital emergency room visits for mental health crises.\n\nSchool counselors across the country have reported an uptick in the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicidality and eating disorders among students.\n\n\u201cStudents who are experiencing thoughts about self-harm are more often advancing those thoughts into action. They now have thoughts, plus a plan, plus action,\u201d Jennifer Akins, a licensed professional counselor and president of the Texas School Counselors Association told Counseling Today in 2022.\n\nOne area of study specifically highlighted nationwide is young people\u2019s lack of emotional regulation. Those key years when kids learn how to \u201cmonitor, evaluate and modify emotions that arise following a stimulus\u201d happened behind computer screens as they stayed at home for online classes during the pandemic.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cA lot of it has been lumped together as an anxiety crisis. I would say we have seen a crisis in social skills, conflict resolution and self management,\u201d Summer Rose, a Dallas-based chief clinical officer for Communities In Schools, an anti-dropout program that works with public and charter schools. \u201cYou forced everybody to only live in a digital world and then put them back in school and told them to do what they were doing but in real life, but they haven\u2019t been taught how to do that in the real world.\u201d\n\nMental health and substance abuse have been linked for many years, but how closely these two correlate has been a topic of research for years.\n\nA 2002 study that looked at two national surveys on drug use concluded that unmet mental health care needs among those with a mental illness will most likely lead to self-medication in the future.\n\n\u201cResults suggest that timely screening and treatment of mental health problems may prevent the development of substance-use disorders among those with mental disorders,\u201d the study states.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nDr. Sarah Martin, division director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, said poor mental health and substance abuse among young people can be considered a two-way street.\n\n\u201cAdolescents with psychiatric disorders use more substances, and those who use more substances have more psychiatric disorders,\u201d she said.\n\nSome young people may think that they can use substances like illicit drugs or alcohol as an easier or cheaper way to find relief instead of seeking professional help, but substance abuse often makes pyschiatric symptoms worse.\n\nMartin said she thinks all public health improvement starts with education, and school is a great place to make sure children and adolescents receive accurate information.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cSubstance use disorder is one type of mental health problem, and when you have one problem of this type, you are more likely to have other problems in the same area,\u201d she said. \u201cSo educating students about mental health and substance abuse makes a lot of sense, and as a psychiatrist, I treat both problems at the same time because they are both so harmful to a child\u2019s future. Good mental health is not possible if a substance use disorder exists, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nHassenfratz of the Engage and Heal Foundation said that\u2019s why the group is looking to gauge lawmakers\u2019 interest in this upcoming special session about attaching a mental health literacy component to Tucker\u2019s Law. The group would like mental health literacy added for all public school students.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re teaching biology, you\u2019re learning about genetics and genes and the way hereditary things are passed down. At the same time, you can talk about how mental health issues are genetically passed down as well,\u201d Hassenfratz said. \u201cThe baseline of mental health literacy is basically helping people understand their feelings and emotions.\u201d\n\nIn whatever form it takes, whether a separate bill or an addition to the fentanyl education program, the group would like the potential addendum to be named for Erik Hanson, a highly accomplished 2017 Lake Travis High School graduate who died by suicide one year into college.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nMartin, who is also an executive committee member for Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine, which provides telemedicine and telehealth programs to schools across the state, said she believes a mental health literacy component would be a great addition to schools.\n\n\u201cWhile I can only speak for Texas Tech El Paso, TCHATT is in a great position to assist in this effort, if needed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe telemedicine program in El Paso serves 34 West Texas school districts, and to date more than 1,550 students have received care from Texas Tech University of Health Sciences Center fellows.\n\nAmelia Floyd, Engage and Heal\u2019s president and co-founder, said if the group can\u2019t get a mental health literacy program in schools then they want to make sure every district\u2019s website has a mental health component to explain emotions, feelings and mental health in general.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cYou can be sad, but depression is a whole different thing,\u201d Hassenfratz said. \u201cOne is a clinical issue and we need to teach the students the difference because a lot of kids are just self-diagnosing.\u201d\n\nA growing number of young people are turning to social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok for guidance, resources and support for their mental health or to find a condition they think matches their feelings. This trend has alarmed therapists and school counselors as mental health diagnoses are being used almost as descriptors instead of an illness.\n\n\u201cIt has become kind of cool to be able to say you have something even though they haven\u2019t been clinically diagnosed. They just say words, like, \u2018I have anxiety,\u2019\u201d Hassenfratz said. She said young people need to learn to recognize when stress becomes unmanageable.\n\nRelying on the internet to self-diagnosis is not a new trend. But mental health providers are concerned that students are now taking any emotion as a sign of mental illness and in turn are now self-medicating their problems away.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nRose, with Communities in Schools in Dallas, said her team has dealt with a lot of mental health questions by students that seemingly spawn from something they viewed on social media.\n\n\u201cA student will say, \u2018I have three or four of the things someone had on a slide on TikTok or Instagram. Does that mean I am suicidal?\u2019\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey are asking more questions, which we love because me and my team are licensed professionals.\u201d\n\nRose said schools have a valuable opportunity to reach students at an early age to teach them about emotional regulation.\n\n\u201cSchools are uniquely positioned to be able to play that critical role in supporting students learning about these conditions in a nonstigmatizing way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors.

The synthetic opioid is rarely taken alone, and health care and law enforcement officials are dealing with multiple deadly drugs at once.\n\nThe illicit use of fentanyl began increasing in Texas around 2015, quickly sparking a crisis. Obtained with a doctor\u2019s prescription, the synthetic opioid can be an effective pain reliever. But there\u2019s been a rise both in the illegal use of the drug and now the manufacture of counterfeit prescription drugs that contain fentanyl but are packaged to look like something else, in an effort to cause addiction and generate repeat buyers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly, at this moment, the drug and the drug supply that is the most dangerous,\u201d said Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nOpioids, including heroin, prescription pills and fentanyl, have caused the most overdose deaths in Texas, according to a Texas Health and Human Services report that studied death certificate data from 2010 to 2019.\n\nAnd because opioids are often mixed with other drugs, there\u2019s been a rise in deaths known as polysubstance overdoses. The most recent state data shows those deaths reaching a rate of four per 100,000 people in 2019.\n\nThe most prevalent drug combinations were commonly prescribed pills, like hydrocodone and oxycodone, mixed with depressants like benzodiazepines and psychostimulants that include amphetamine and methamphetamine.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason I caution very much against focusing on one drug,\u201d Neill Harris said. \u201cFentanyl is certainly a big problem. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the last drug crime crisis that we are going to face.\u201d\n\nThe role of methamphetamine in the illegal drug market has been pushed aside in headlines as images of drug use in the South turned from exploding meth labs to potentially deadly fentanyl pills. But drug experts say meth has made an unwanted comeback as meth manufacturers have begun making a stronger product.\n\n\u201cMeth is eating everybody\u2019s lunch and nobody\u2019s talking about it. Meth is crawling up on everybody,\u201d said Peter Stout, president and chief executive officer of the Houston Forensic Science Center. \u201cMeth fatalities are way up even if you look at the Texas numbers.\u201d\n\nExperts say if Texas wants to solve the overdose problem, officials here must fully realize the state has an overall drug issue that goes beyond fentanyl. Here\u2019s a look at the broader drug situation across Texas.\n\nWhat are the drug trends?\u00a0\n\nWhen the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Addiction Research Institute studied calls made to poison control centers, admissions to drug treatment programs and drug seizures in 2021, researchers found the most common drugs flowing across the state\u2019s southern border from Mexico were methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, marijuana, fentanyl, benzodiazepines like Xanax, and synthetic cannabinoids more commonly known as \u201cspice\u201d or K2.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nWhile marijuana is still popular in Texas, its role in the illegal drug market has diminished greatly as 25 states across the country so far have passed laws to legalize it. When Texas legalized hemp in 2019, the prosecution of low-level pot cases declined due to the costly testing needed to determine if a vape pen liquid or a gummy contains marijuana or hemp because both come from the same plant species.\n\nBut hemp contains less than 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the ingredient in marijuana that gets you high. Anything with less THC is hemp.\n\nSynthetic narcotics like fentanyl, meanwhile, have shot up the ranks of causes of overdose deaths. In the past five years, deaths from synthetics have surpassed deaths from other opioids, heroin and depressants.\n\nWhat is fentanyl?\u00a0\n\nIllegally manufactured fentanyl is a perilous chemical experiment, a stew of synthetic opioids.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nOpium derived from poppies has long been used as a painkiller and recreational drug. Opioids like fentanyl or oxycodone are chemical concoctions that duplicate those effects.\n\nFentanyl was created in 1960 and approved for use in America in 1968. It\u2019s most commonly used as a sedative and pain reliever for patients. Legally obtained fentanyl is usually administered to patients through pills, intravenous therapy, skin patches or nasal spray.\n\nBut it can also be distilled and blended to produce a fine powder that can be easily added to other drugs.\n\nIts potent molecules scurry straight to the brain, where thousands of receptors, similar to tiny satellite dishes, pull in signals from cells in the body. They have different jobs, some gathering information to control organ functions, others emotions or moods.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nFentanyl latches on to the receptors that signal pain and shuts them down. And when those receptors are turned off, the human body reacts in ways that can be fatal, including shutting down lungs and other vital organs.\n\nThe drug is considered 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin.\n\nFentanyl isn\u2019t the only drug mixture that has the federal Drug Enforcement Administration concerned as the growing threat of xylazine is starting to make its way into Texas.\n\nXylazine: A new threat\n\nXylazine is a tranquilizer, as opposed to a painkiller, doing its work by numbing nerves rather than switching off receptors in the brain. It targets the central nervous system, the nerve highways running in and out of the spinal column that carries messages to the rest of the body.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nDeveloped in 1962, it\u2019s used by veterinarians to keep elephants and horses calm enough to be examined or have their teeth cleaned. It mostly comes in liquid form and is sold in vials or preloaded syringes.\n\nWhen tranquilizers are used, the spinal column sends messages to the brain to slow down a bit. This produces a sense of calm and elation, which is why tranquilizers are also used to treat anxiety, panic attacks and sleep disorders.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration reported the first instances of this tranquilizer being used in illegal drug activity in the early 2000s by drug dealers in Puerto Rico when they began mixing it with other substances. The practice has now spread across the United States and has been found recently in Texas mixed with fentanyl.\n\nXylazine has been found in a growing number of overdose deaths across the country and is commonly encountered in combination with fentanyl, cocaine, heroin and a variety of other drugs.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nMeth\u00a0\n\nMethamphetamine is a white, odorless, crystalline powder that was developed early in the 20th century from its parent, amphetamine, and was originally used in nasal decongestants and inhalers. It can come in liquid form, which is easily made into a crystal form by drug traffickers. The highly addictive stimulant outpaced all others in the 2021 UT study of Texas drug trends.\n\nThe drug targets the brain and the spinal cord to create a sense of well-being or euphoria. Symptoms can include talkativeness, decreased appetite and a pleasurable sense of well-being. Meth also speeds up the body\u2019s systems to sometimes lethal levels by increasing blood pressure and heart and respiratory rates.\n\nTexas drug labs have recently started seeing meth being placed in counterfeit Adderall pills, meaning a segment of meth users might be unaware they are even addicted to the drug.\n\nHeroin\n\nHeroin is made from morphine, a natural substance taken from the seed pod of an opium poppy plant typically grown in Asia, Mexico and Colombia. It\u2019s often portrayed in film and television as a needle drug, but the substance can also be snorted or smoked. In the past, heroin was often mixed with crack cocaine, but fentanyl has become the primary substance being added to poppy plant extract. Dealers will often \u201ccut\u201d heroin with other substances to allow them to sell more of it at a higher price.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe 2021 UT study of drug trends showed that Texas has avoided the heroin overdose crisis seen in other states because Mexican black tar heroin is the most common version of the drug found in the state. Black tar heroin tends to have an average purity of 28% and cannot be easily mixed with fentanyl.\n\n\u201cTar\u201d heroin is usually sold in small balloons from which the user extracts the sticky substance from the balloon by mixing it with water over heat.\n\nCocaine/crack\u00a0\n\nCocaine, the highly addictive stimulant made from coca leaves, was used more than a century ago to treat a wide variety of illnesses and was often used by early surgeons to block pain before local anesthetics were developed. Frequent use can alter brain structure and function. Users can inject or snort the powdered version of cocaine. \u201cCrack\u201d is the term often given to cocaine after it has been refined into a smokable substance.\n\nWhat can be done?\u00a0\n\nLawmakers in Texas have recently tried to tackle the state\u2019s overdose problem by aggressively attacking fentanyl distribution and use by means of enforcement and awareness.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nLast week, Gov. Greg Abbott signed four bills to combat the growing fentanyl crisis, including House Bill 6, which classifies overdoses from the synthetic opioid as \u201cpoisonings,\u201d triggering murder charges for those convicted of giving someone a fatal dose of the synthetic opioid.\n\n\u201cThese four laws will forever change Texas through new protections that will help save lives,\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cIn 2022, more than 2,000 people died from fentanyl in Texas \u2014 more than five a day. It is the No. 1 killer of Americans ages 18-45.\u201d\n\nOther measures signed by Abbott will establish a Fentanyl Poisoning Awareness Month in October and require public schools to provide students with staff to assist with fentanyl abuse prevention and drug poisoning awareness. A fourth law will allow the distribution of Narcan or other opioid antagonists to Texas colleges and universities.\n\nHowever, bold substance abuse measures like legalizing test strips were once again rejected by lawmakers.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nNeill Harris, the drug policy fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said to combat fentanyl and the next impending drug crisis, the state must increase access to medical substance abuse treatments over enforcement measures.\n\n\u201cUntil we have policies that address the demand, we\u2019re going to continue to have a problem with drug use,\u201d she said. \u201cLaw enforcement has always had problems with reducing the drug supply. We look back over decades and it has never been effective at slowing down the supply. Because there\u2019s always a demand. It\u2019s just simple economics.\u201d\n\nMichele Steeb, a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, said their organization views addiction as a complex brain disorder disease.\n\n\u201cWell-supported scientific evidence shows that brain disruptions reduce brain function which inhibits the ability to make decisions and regulate one\u2019s actions, emotions, and impulses,\u201d she said. \u201c... Diseases require treatment.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nIf the state can\u2019t control the supply, Neill Harris said, it\u2019s time to focus on reducing the harm of drug use by legalizing testing strips, making substitute drug treatment like methadone more available and giving more substance use options to the uninsured.\n\nGo behind the headlines with newly announced speakers at the 2023 Texas Tribune Festival, in downtown Austin from Sept. 21-23.

The frustration level is palpable across the state.\u201d\n\nThe medication-assisted treatment program, or MAT, launched last year to help jails respond to the opioid crisis by allowing them to offer anticraving medications \u2014 such as injections of the opioid-blocker Vivitrol \u2014 along with counseling to help stem overdose deaths.\n\nThe program also aims to increase community safety by reducing recidivism and can help people with opioid addiction get treatment in jail and after their release, Felix said.\n\nColorado\u2019s Behavioral Health Administration, which works to ensure Coloradans can access to mental health and addiction services, said jails must adjust their budgets or find alternative funding to sustain their medication-assisted treatment programs, leaving many facilities uncertain about the future of their services, especially rural ones. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nSince 2011, the state has required jails to provide mental health and substance use disorder services through a program called Jail Based Behavioral Health Services. In 2023, jails were required to add the medication-assisted treatment program to their existing behavioral health services.\n\nJails recently received money from the state to continue running jail-based behavioral health services but won\u2019t get any more state or federal funding, so far, to help continue running the new medication-assisted treatment portion of the program, Felix said.\n\nThe Delta County Jail received $380,000 from the state this fiscal year for its behavioral health services and $20,000 from federal grants to start the opioid treatment program.\n\nThe Behavioral Health Administration said jails should pull funds from their behavioral health services budgets to help fund the medication-assisted treatment program until a permanent solution can be found.\n\nJails can request opioid settlement money or other funding from their county leaders, the Behavioral Health Administration said.\n\nThe state Medicaid program is exploring other solutions such as one that would allow it to seek a federal waiver to provide medication-assisted treatment for Medicaid-eligible people up to 90 days before their release.\n\n\u201cThis would provide a long-term solution to cover jail based medication-assisted treatment costs, but if enacted, would still be a few years away from adding support,\u201d Busch wrote in the email.\n\nDiverting funds to pay for other substance use services\n\nIf the Delta County Jail is unable to find alternative funding for its opioid treatment, leaders there will have to do what the Behavioral Health Administration suggested and divert funding from other key services, Felix said.\n\n\u201cThe other end of jail-based behavioral health services is going to suffer because we\u2019ll be pulling funds from those essential services to remain legally in compliance with state regulations for medication-assisted treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe jails will suffer but not as much as the inmates will.\u201d\n\nBunk beds at the Delta County Jail are seen March 28, 2024.

Currently, she has about $12,000 left to administer the program before the money is spent by the end of June.\n\nThe Behavioral Health Administration is partnering with state agencies to find funding, and jails can explore grants to help fund the state\u2019s MAT program.\n\n\u201cBHA is committed to working with jails to support identifying other funding streams to keep this vital service afloat,\u201d Busch wrote.\n\nAddressing a lack of funding for medication-assisted treatment in jails across the state is a priority for the attorney general\u2019s office, Lawrence Pacheco, a spokesperson for the AG\u2019s office wrote in an email to The Sun this week.\n\nThe attorney general announced an award program in January that would allow people to nominate jails that could receive one-time $50,000 grants to help the facilities continue running the opioid treatment program.\n\nA women\u2019s pod-style unit is seen at the Delta County Jail March 28, 2024.

Daniel Cano Jr., Delta County Jail administrator.\n\nBut jails have become de facto treatment providers for people with mental illness and substance use disorders because of underfunded and disorganized mental health services in the community, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nState and local governments shut down mental health hospitals during the deinstitutionalization movement from 1955 to 1980 but failed to provide adequate alternatives, according to the advocacy organization.\n\nNow people who are repeatedly arrested are often people of color, others living in poverty, people with low education, those who are unemployed and others who have serious unmet medical and mental health needs, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.\n\nThe Colorado Sun visited the Delta County Jail on March 28.\n\nCameras in the jail\u2019s control room at one point showed one man with mental illness repeatedly pacing from one corner in his small cell to the other.\n\n\u201cHe will do that for hours at a time,\u201d a guard told a Sun reporter.\n\nThe medical facility, where people are seen for medication-assisted treatment and other health concerns, is next to padded cells where people who are a harm to themselves or others are held until medical staff release them.\n\nThe Delta County Jail on March 28, 2024.

Of those participants, just over 20% are enrolled in the medication-assisted treatment program.\n\n\u201cWe want to turn these people back into society knowing that those cravings are taken care of in here, so they don\u2019t go right back out and use, and eventually overdose and die,\u201d Felix said.\n\nChelsea Herrera, 25, who was incarcerated at the Delta County Jail several times last year, said medication-assisted treatment gave her a chance to recover and heal.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re in the drug world, you get stuck there and you lose hope,\u201d Herrera said Tuesday. \u201cBut once you start the medication-assisted treatment program, it gives you hope, so that you don\u2019t need street drugs to continue to get through your life.\u201d\n\nPeople with alcohol addiction can also benefit from the program by receiving a Vivitrol shot once per month, Herrera said.\n\nHerrera also participated in therapy while she was in the program and said she didn\u2019t comply with medication-assisted treatment until she was also able to receive grief counseling inside the jail.\n\nIn 2020, Herrera got into a car wreck and accidentally killed her grandmother. Soon after, she said she began abusing alcohol.\n\nBut grief counseling at the jail helped her find a new desire to address not only her addiction but also the trauma from the deadly crash.\n\nNow, she works at a local bar in Alamosa, goes to counseling and takes medications. She\u2019s out of jail, and has been sober for five months now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing really well,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI\u2019m able to work at a bar without having cravings, which feels really good.

It\u2019s a huge epidemic. Men\u2019s prisons have a lot of gangs set up and many of these facilities will hire former inmates to try to give them a chance. It could be former inmates, their family and corrections officers who bring drugs in.\u201d\n\nA former visiting room is seen at the Delta County Jail. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nConcerns about a reduction in behavioral health services at the Delta jail come after the closure in early February of Integrated Insight Community Care, a Delta-based clinic that provided medical and mental health care to some of the most vulnerable people on the Western Slope.\n\nThe loss of services at Integrated, which cared for about 1,400 patients, is significant because many people who were released from Delta County Jail were linked to medical, mental health and addiction services there.\n\nNow that the clinic is closed, when vulnerable people are released from the jail they will be without their best option for mental health stabilization and substance use disorder recovery, Felix said.\n\n\u201cThe concern is, it takes a long time to build trust between a population that is stigmatized and punished to find a therapist that they can rely on and trust,\u201d Felix said.\n\n\u201cWhen we release these people we want them to follow up with providers and stay on their meds and if we don\u2019t have someone to immediately refer them to, who will hold them accountable for staying on their protocol?\u201d Felix asked.\n\nSince the medication-assisted treatment initiative began at the jail last April, just three out of 22 of the program\u2019s participants have returned to the jail, Felix said. The three people who returned were receiving care at methadone clinics outside the jail.\n\nA common area is seen at the Delta County Jail March 28, 2024. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for methadone users to continue to use other illicit drugs, so their lifestyle doesn\u2019t change much when they are released, which is likely what contributes to the recidivism,\u201d she said. \u201cZero percent recidivism is ideal but the purpose of medication-assisted treatment is harm reduction and zero overdoses is a success as well.\u201d\n\nMany people incarcerated at the Delta jail have a mental health and substance use disorder. But there\u2019s a small population that has both conditions as well as intellectual and developmental disabilities. They will not only need mental health and addiction treatment but other support services, including help with daily living, when they\u2019re released, Felix said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already suffering in the community with a lack of resources and they don\u2019t have the mental fortitude to ask for help or know who their resources are,\u201d Felix said. \u201cI need a bigger community base and team to ensure that, when they\u2019re released from here, they\u2019re getting the support they need because they\u2019re going to need it for the rest of their lives.\u201d", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com", "article_id": "8fb18635-487a-400f-8f9c-c63494286d72", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

The point of this initiative is to try to change that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe selected 15 diverse counties around the country in the hopes of setting up opioid treatment in jails, so that others can look to them as an example.\u201d\n\nCook County Jail has long offered medication-assisted treatment and detoxification programs that allowed individuals who were receiving treatment prior to incarceration to continue that treatment in jail, according to Dr. Stamatia Richardson, divisional chair and lead physician for the substance use disorder program at Cook County Health.\n\nIn 2014, Cook County began offering medication-assisted treatment to individuals who were not receiving treatment prior to incarceration. Two years later, the jail started a program that trained individuals how to use the opioid reversal medication naloxone and armed them with a kit upon discharge. Currently, the jail offers all three FDA-approved drugs for medication-assisted treatment \u2013 methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone \u2013 in conjunction with behavioral health supports.\n\n\u201cCook County is leading the pack. Both in terms of its offerings of medications and its size,\u201d said Williams. (Cook County Jail is the largest single-site jail in the nation.) \u201cWe anticipate some other counties learning from what Cook County has already done.\u201d\n\nEducation is the main focus of the nine-month grant, which will provide recipients with about $700,000 worth of in-kind services to address the issue, including site visits, technical support, webinars and a pair of meetings in Washington, D.C., in August and January 2020.\n\nMennella and Richardson are hoping to learn best practices for treatment, and they\u2019re particularly interested in seeking advice for developing treatment plans.\n\n\u201cJails are unique in that discharge dates are unknown,\u201d said Mennella. \u201cThe length of stay (for a detainee) may be eight hours or eight years. (We\u2019re interested in) looking at opportunities, like, \u2018What does treatment look like if they\u2019re here 48 hours? What can we do in 48 hours, and what\u2019s best to focus on in 48 hours?\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s not as simple as one would think. Because we don\u2019t have outdates, we\u2019d like more expertise on how to best develop that plan because there are some unknowns.\u201d\n\nMennella and Richardson are also seeking guidance on navigating transitions in care, such as when an individual leaves jail and begins electronic monitoring on parole, to ensure continued treatment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still not enough care in the community,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWe have to grow together within the bars and outside. If we don\u2019t grow together, the care will be better in one place than another. We don\u2019t want people to have to be incarcerated to get care.\u201d\n\nEnsuring that continuation of care outside of jails is crucial and will be key for the second phase of the grant, says Williams. \u201cThe first nine months is setting up, finalizing protocols and getting the necessary stakeholders on board and support from the community,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second phase of the grant will involve a subset of the 15 selected counties that are the best prepared to roll out programs, according to Williams.\n\nAll materials generated from the grant will be made publicly available and dissmeminated nationally to law enforcement agencies, public health departments and addiction treatment providers, says Williams.\n\nContact Kristen Thometz:\u00a0@kristenthometz\u00a0|\u00a0kthometz@wttw.com\u00a0| (773) 509-5452\n\nRelated stories:\n\nSheriff Tom Dart Launches Podcast About Opioid Epidemic\n\nIllinois Receives $15 Million to Fight Opioid Crisis\n\nDEA Launches Digital Billboard Campaign Against Opioid Use\n\nOpioid Epidemic Hits Cook County Jail\n\nTAGS\nOPIOIDS COOK COUNTY JAIL COOK COUNTY ADDICTION\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter to get all of our stories delivered to your mailbox each weekday.\n\n\u00a0\nTRENDING\nSIGN UP FOR THE WTTW NEWS NEWSLETTER\n\nCOMMENTS\nThanks to our sponsors:\nView all sponsors\nThanks to our sponsors:\nView all sponsors\nThanks to our sponsors:\nView all sponsors\nRECURRING FEATURES\nA Safer City\nArt Design Chicago\nAsk Geoffrey\nBlack Voices\nChicago Tonight\nFirsthand Series\nHedy Weiss Reviews\nInvestigations\nLatino Voices\nSpotlight Politics\nWeek in Review\nWTTW News Explains\u00a0", "source_domain": "news.wttw.com", "article_id": "fb74049b-ce97-4ab7-8582-36101e6c3f00", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}
{"url": "https://www.uchealth.org/today/geriatric-mental-health-resources-clinic-treats-neurologic-mental-health-disorders/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Often, signs of aging are obvious as time takes its inevitable toll. Shoulders slump forward. Joints groan. Hands tremble. Hair accumulates in brushes and combs.\n\nBut aging also plays out on a far less visible stage: the brain. The consequences may be creeping memory loss and slower cognition. Many people adapt to these neurologic changes on their own or with the help of loved ones. In others, however, changes in the brain progress to serious problems, including dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, all of which may wreak havoc on their lives and loved ones.\n\nThese physical brain battles may, in turn, intertwine with psychiatric problems, like depression, anxiety and psychosis, and emotional demands posed by aging. It\u2019s unwise to treat them separately, said Dr. Samantha Holden, assistant professor of Neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Holden practices at the UCHealth Neurology Clinic \u2013 Central Park, specializing in movement and cognition disorders.\n\n\u201cIt really is a false dichotomy to say, \u2018This is neurologic and this is psychiatric and never the twain shall meet,\u2019\u201d Holden said. \u201cIt\u2019s all your brain.\u201d\n\nHolden noted, for example, that psychiatric issues like depression, apathy and anxiety frequently accompany Parkinson\u2019s disease, a progressive neurologic movement disorder. The clinical line between the two is blurry, at best, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure that we look at the whole person and see how your condition affects you and your well-being,\u201d Holden said.\n\nGeriatric mental health resources\n\nHolden is part of a team that is doing just that. She joined last July with Drs. Karina Drake and Evan Plys to launch the Geriatric Mental Health Clinic, part of the UCHealth Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic \u2013 Anschutz Medical Campus. Holden, along with four other Neurology Clinic colleagues, refer patients they think will benefit from geriatric mental health resources to the clinic.\n\nDrake, an MD who completed a fellowship in geriatric psychiatry, helps patients safely balance their often complicated medication regimens, while also providing psychotherapy and other support. Plys, a PhD geropsychologist, focuses on individual therapy with patients who have mild or no impairment from their neurologic conditions. He also offered group therapy for caregivers last winter and spring and hopes to do so again in the fall.\n\nThe Geriatric Mental Health Clinic aims to help patients and their loved ones regain at least a measure of control over the disruption caused by their neurologic disorders. The challenges may be psycho-social: grief, anger, depression, and apathy over the idea of losing the life they anticipated to an incurable disease. Left untreated, these symptoms \u2013 the most common being depression and anxiety \u2013 can further deteriorate patients\u2019 health, Plys said.\n\nIndividual therapy to restore meaning and purpose\n\n\u201cPatients with these psychological concerns can have low motivation to engage in routine healthy behaviors, like exercise, diet and social engagement,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly as we get older, it\u2019s essential to engage in these behaviors. When we see mood becoming a barrier that is often a good time for people to come in for therapy.\u201d\n\nPlys said he uses cognitive behavioral therapy to help patients identify the thoughts that create barriers to pursuing healthy habits and work on ways to overcome them. He described the sessions as collaborative, with patients developing \u201caction plans\u201d aimed at finding activities that produce a sense of meaning and purpose. Those are unique to each person: spending time with grandchildren, working in the garden, developing new hobbies, and connecting with old friends, for example. The idea is to build \u201cmastery,\u201d as Plys put it, over the mental disorders spurred by disease.\n\nThe process is not open-ended, Plys said. He typically starts patients with six, 50-minute sessions, then \u201crenegotiates,\u201d based on their progress toward meeting their goals.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of therapy is to promote a patient\u2019s function without a therapist,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to help you build skills and apply them to your own life. If I\u2019ve done my job successfully, I\u2019ve essentially made myself obsolete in the life of the patient.\u201d\n\nMedication management for neurologic disorders is crucial\n\nSome patients Holden refers to the clinic suffer from acute changes in the brain that produce not only depression and anxiety but also psychosis, delusions, and hallucinations. In these cases, Drake works to evaluate and manage patients\u2019 medications to safely treat both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. She said she also considers the \u201ccomplex medical histories and cognitive disorders\u201d that increasingly emerge as people age.\n\nDrake said she conducts a full psychiatric evaluation of symptoms, medical issues, the neurological workup, and the progression of the patient\u2019s neurological disorder. She then develops a treatment plan to address each patient\u2019s psychiatric issues, depending on the underlying cause. That may include referring a patient to Plys for individual therapy.\n\nA big part of Drake\u2019s work is evaluating all the medications a patient is taking, because those prescribed for different problems may have dangerous interactions.\n\n\u201cPolypharmacy can be a huge issue in older patients,\u201d Drake said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know a patient\u2019s updated medical issues, not only for prescribing medications, but sometimes deprescribing.\u201d\n\nThe goal: eliminate medications that are redundant and those that produce unwanted side effects. She noted, for example, providers frequently prescribe benzodiazepines, such as Xanax and Valium, to treat anxiety. They produce short-term benefits, but also long-term side effects like changes in cognition and confusion.\n\n\u201cThe long-term risks of these medications increase as people age,\u201d Drake said. \u201cThe question is how do we manage anxiety while working to get patients off these medications? It must be done slowly and cautiously.\u201d\n\nDrake emphasized that her work forms an interdependent triangle of care with neurology and psychology.\n\n\u201cWe are working together to address the far-reaching effects of cognitive disorders,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must approach the problem from multiple angles, given the complexities. Addressing one without the others is a losing battle.\u201d\n\nA \u2018gut punch\u2019 diagnosis\n\nThe experience of Dennis and Sue Stretar of Aurora illustrates both the life-changing challenges presented by neurologic disease and mental health issues and the benefits of the collaborative care and resources provided by the Geriatric Mental Health Clinic.\n\nThe Stretars, now married for 26 years, met in 1994 through a \u201cSunday Night Club\u201d for older singles through Colorado Free University. After marriage in 1995, they co-hosted \u201cColorado Today,\u201d a public affairs program on KEZW-AM radio covering lifestyle and health-related aging issues that ran from 1999 to 2006. In 2002, they expanded the program to public television and print through a Health and Human Services grant. During this period, Sue survived a bout with breast cancer \u2013 chronicled in a documentary Dennis produced for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month \u2013 and made a complete recovery.\n\nDennis, now producer and host for the Aurora-based Our Community Broadcasting Network, noted that he and Sue worked extensively with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association during their days with \u201cColorado Today.\u201d That helped prepare them in 2010, when Sue\u2019s mother, now 94, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cBetween the two of us, we knew a lot about Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia in general,\u201d Dennis said.\n\nThen came another blow. In 2019, Sue, then only 63, began exhibiting signs of mental decline, including frequent rounds of confusion and forgetfulness.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d suddenly be in the fog and very quizzical about what was going on and what she was supposed to be doing,\u201d Dennis said.\n\nHe recalled a key incident that occurred on a morning he needed to pick up their car from a local repair shop. He woke Sue up to remind her to drive him over, then went back to his office to wait for her to get ready. He heard her go down the stairs, then listened to the sound of the garage door going up and the car pulling away. Startled, he waited about 10 minutes for her to return, with the explanation that she thought Dennis was going to make a long, cold-morning walk to the repair shop to meet her.\n\nAfter more instances of forgetfulness that she frequently blamed on Dennis, Sue finally conceded that there was a problem they needed to address. The two met with a neurologist, who verified that she had a memory issue. After a lengthy battery of tests, she received a diagnosis of dementia, which Dennis described as \u201ca gut punch.\u201d\n\nDementia and depression form an explosive combination\n\nThe problem was to worsen, as neurology and psychiatry crossed paths. Sue had also managed clinical depression for 30 years. But in March 2020, she began experiencing violent hallucinations, delusions and bouts of paranoia, Dennis recounted. In one particularly frightening encounter, her neurologist witnessed Sue \u201ccoming apart before her very eyes,\u201d he said. Sue received prescriptions for anti-psychotic medications, but by May 2020, Dennis said, she was close to needing hospitalization.\n\nFortunately, Sue received a referral to Holden for further treatment of her dementia. He and Sue met in December 2020 with her for a complete evaluation, but it was a rocky encounter. Dennis described Sue\u2019s behavior as \u201cvery hostile,\u201d and Holden\u2019s recommendation as blunt.\n\n\u201cDr. Holden told me after that session that unless we can Sue\u2019s mood enhanced, we won\u2019t be effective in treating her [dementia],\u201d Dennis said.\n\nWith that, Holden referred Sue to Drake, who met with the Stretars via Zoom in January 2021. Dennis said the collaboration between the two specialists was crucial.\n\n\u201cDr. Drake came in knowing what Sue was dealing with,\u201d he said. After evaluating Sue, Drake prescribed a combination of medications for anxiety and clinical depression. With that issue handled, Holden prescribed Aricept, a medication to bolster cognition in early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Dennis said Aricept, while not a cure, has helped Sue improve her short-term memory retention and moderate her confusion.\n\n\u201cThe meds are working fine. I would call her very stable,\u201d Dennis said.\n\nNeurologic disorders: Adapting to a new way of life\n\nHe is clear-eyed about the challenges that lie ahead, however. He recognizes that Sue will withdraw at times and enter periods of confusion that he describes as \u201cthe fog rolling in.\u201d He accepts that she will no longer connect with friends of longstanding and that he \u201ccan\u2019t push her to do that.\u201d\n\nDennis strives to find ways to help both adapt to their new reality. They go out to eat, walk the dogs, and stroll through open malls to watch kids play in fountains. Sue loves to garden, so Dennis expanded the flowerbeds around the house to encourage that. He even went a bit against the conventional advice to keep people with dementia away from crowds and high-intensity situations by taking Sue to a Colorado Rockies game. He did so cautiously, purchasing club-level seats that would give them easy escape if she panicked. That went so well that in late July they attended another game, where she mingled with crowds in the rooftop section of Coors Field.\n\nAs important as it is to support loved ones with neurologic and cognitive issues, Dennis added, caregivers must take care of themselves.\n\n\u201cYou have to avoid at all costs giving up your own personality, your likes and your loves,\u201d he said. \u201cFind something that is yours that is away from the caregiving issue.\u201d\n\nIn his case, he finds time to visit old friends himself, usually in the mornings while Sue sleeps. \u201cI need socialization,\u201d Dennis said simply.\n\nHe credits Holden and Drake for helping to stabilize a situation that can be untenable for patients and caregivers who lack resources.\n\n\u201cThe concept of coordinated care is very important, and the time for it is now,\u201d Dennis said. \u201cDr. Holden and Dr. Drake are the best of the best when it comes to [that].\u201d\n\nGeriatric mental health resources: An increasingly important service in an aging world\n\nHolden said the Geriatric Mental Health Clinic fills a vital need for an aging population still wary of admitting the need for counseling and therapy. Fears of mental deterioration loom large in the imaginations of the elderly, she said.\n\n\u201cIf my brain is threatened, that\u2019s existential in a way that no other health condition is,\u201d Holden said.\n\nToo often in the past, she added, treatable mental health issues deteriorated to the point where admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was the final option.\n\n\u201cWe see the clinic having overall benefits for quality of life,\u201d Holden said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing psychiatry more into the fold of the normal standard of care.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.uchealth.org", "article_id": "693593aa-e40e-483a-a0b3-263d8bf809e7", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}
{"url": "https://www.uchealth.org/today/helping-patients-with-opioid-addiction-move-on-to-recovery/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "The central act of Larry Harrison\u2019s day is to tip back a couple of ounces of liquid that tastes like pink cough syrup. On this day in early December, he has ridden a half hour in a white Helping Hands minivan from an apartment halfway across town to do so. He did the same thing yesterday; he will do it again tomorrow.\n\nThe pink liquid contains a precise dose of methadone \u2013 in Harrison\u2019s case, 130 milligrams of it. Methadone binds to the same brain receptors as opioids such as heroin, cutting cravings and quelling withdrawal symptoms that, in Harrison\u2019s case, \u201cget so bad I wish I was dead.\u201d\n\nHarrison, 50, has been sober for two years now. He has been clean thanks to a collaboration between UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital on the Anschutz Medical Campus and the University of Colorado School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry program called ARTS \u2013 Addiction Research and Treatment Services. Since 2018, UCHealth specialists have been identifying inpatients with substance-use disorders and enrolling them; ARTS, which has been helping those with addiction since 1972, takes it from there. While one can\u2019t know what would have happened to Harrison otherwise, he has an idea.\n\n\u201cI had been on an 11-year heroin binge,\u201d he says. \u201cI was killing myself with heroin.\u201d\n\nHarrison, who was homeless for much of those 11 years, has come close before, overdosing a handful of times to the point he stopped breathing and turned blue. Abscesses have left deep scars on his forearms and lower legs and required skin grafts on his shoulders. The infections developed because he resorted to injecting under the skin rather than into veins so destroyed from years of puncturing three to four times a day that, when hospitalized, nurses have had to put IVs in his forehead, he says.\n\nHe has been hospitalized a lot. Asked how much time he\u2019s spent in inpatient beds over the past decade-plus, he estimates: \u201cThree years.\u201d\n\nA thousand days, give or take. Dirty needles brought infection after infection, and most stays involved intravenous antibiotics and observation that went on for a couple of weeks or longer. He has suffered three major and six minor strokes which have long been tied to heroin addiction (often, endocarditis \u2013 another affliction common among intravenous drug users \u2013 is the trigger). The strokes have left his left arm and leg weakened and the left side of his face partially paralyzed. He moves slowly. He tires easily. He walks with a cane.\n\nOpioid addiction: A \u2018Slave to the molecule\u2019\n\nHarrison is far from alone in suffering irreparable damage from what he describes as \u201cchasing the dragon\u201d of opioid addiction. In fiscal 2019-20, ARTS treated about 1,500 outpatients among its three clinics, and ARTS\u2019s Potomac Street clinic that Harrison frequents is one of 28 opioid treatment centers statewide. They\u2019re all working to slow the growing damage the opioid epidemic continues to do. Colorado saw about 1,500 deaths from drug overdoses in 2020 \u2013 up 38% from the previous year. Opioids caused more than half of them, with fentanyl being the prime culprit. Nationally, more than 75,000 people died of opioid overdoses in 2020 \u2013 nearly twice the 42,000 U.S. automotive fatalities that year.\n\nWhile opioid addiction is a vexing problem, the solutions are well understood. Forcing someone who\u2019s addicted to go cold turkey is not one of them. The gold standard is called medication-assisted treatment, and that\u2019s what Larry Harrison is doing through ARTS. MAT recognizes that opioids can change brain chemistry in ways that overwhelm conscious resistance and that pharmaceuticals such as methadone and buprenorphine are often crucial to long-term recovery. But getting off opioids is about more than prescription drugs.\n\nDr. Tyler Coyle, a CU School of Medicine psychiatrist and addiction specialist at ARTS, put it this way: \u201cYour brain just becomes a slave to the molecule, and you are not able to break free. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have children; it doesn\u2019t matter if you have willpower of iron. You can\u2019t do it on your own. You need a whole team.\u201d\n\nIn a 2020 Colorado Health Institute report, opioid experts also cited inpatient, residential, and outpatient treatment as well as \u201crecovery supports\u201d as being vital levers in tackling the opioid crisis. Those recovery supports include access to housing, health care and other resources \u2013 from counseling to reliable rides to methadone clinics \u2013 designed to promote recovery.\n\nRoot cause of UCHealth-ARTS connection for patients with opioid addiction\n\nARTS has been doing all this for years. UCH and has been treating patients for infections and other maladies caused by opioid addiction for years. It wasn\u2019t until Dr. Susan Calcaterra arrived at UCH in 2018 that the UCHealth-ARTS connection happened.\n\nCalcaterra, who directs UCH\u2019s Addiction Medicine Consultation Service, came from Denver Health, where one of those 28 opioid treatment centers happens to be. She saw how the typical cycle of treating the medical maladies of those addicted to opioids and then sending them back out on the street to use drugs again, get infected again, and land in the hospital again could be broken. Infections looked like a health problem, but they were really just symptoms of the deeper disease of opioid addiction.\n\nHer inquiries led her to ARTS Director Angela Bonaguidi, and soon Calcaterra was training as an opioid treatment provider \u2013 a precondition for enrolling patients in methadone programs. State Opioid Response Grant money channeled through ARTS would pay for a slice of her time far thinner than that which she would commit.\n\nThe program works like this. When someone with substance-use disorder gets admitted, Calcaterra visits them, assesses them, and asks if they\u2019re interested in being a part of ARTS\u2019s drug-treatment program.\n\nShe\u2019ll tell them things like, \u201cI\u2019m here to offer you a couple of things. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to take them. My goal is to make you feel a little bit better. And, by the way, you matter,\u201d she explains.\n\nFor many, she says, the chaos and uncertainty of day-to-day survival has been too great a barrier to overcome. They haven\u2019t even considered treatment programs. If they choose to participate \u2013 and often they do, as was the case on a recent Friday, when Calcaterra enrolled three patients \u2013 Calcaterra signs them up and brings in UCHealth nurse Emma Maki-Gianani, a specialist in case management and substance-use counseling. Maki-Gianani spends about four hours with the patient working through the details of their lives, explaining the ARTS program, and dealing with a lot of enrollment paperwork.\n\nThe descent into opioid addiction\n\nWith Larry Harrison, that session and the ones that followed educated him on the path forward as he educated her on what he had been through. Following a childhood in and out of foster care, a telephone-sales job in Oklahoma City turned quickly into a telephone-sales management job. He later worked for years as a property manager. He married, had two kids, and was approaching his 40s in a stable, middle-class life when, in the late-2000s, kidney stones led to an overzealous Percocet prescription, and the sorts of pill mills that have made the Sacklers infamous finished the job. The opioid addiction that roared in unraveled his life.\n\nHe, his then-wife, and two kids \u2013 a 12-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter \u2013 came to Colorado as the weather turned cold in 2011. Robbed of what valuables they had at the bus station, they were forced to beg at intersections. Harrison resorted to selling drugs. Someone called the state Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, and the kids were soon back in Oklahoma with his wife\u2019s sister. He hadn\u2019t seen them since, he told Maki-Gianani. He had been in and out of jail, in and out of hospitals, living in a vacant lot behind a Taco Bell near Interstate 225 and Peoria Street and lots of other places no one imagines themselves ever having to live, and propelled from hour to hour and day to day more or less solely by a primordial drive to feed his insatiable opioid receptors.\n\nCalcaterra emphasizes the importance of empathy and being nonjudgmental. Harrison saw that immediately, he recalls.\n\n\u201cThey actually care \u2013 I was so blown away by it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m at a place where they care about me and won\u2019t just throw me back out on the street. If you treat and then just let them go, they\u2019re right back where they were. It\u2019s kind of hard for anybody to be productive when they\u2019re sleeping under a tree or in a mud puddle.\u201d\n\nOnce enrolled, the patient can start on an effective dose of methadone while in the hospital. That\u2019s important because methadone takes time to settle in, so having a good start prior to discharge boosts the odds of the patient staying with ARTS and away from used needles. UCH becomes a smooth on-ramp into the outpatient program.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s been very rewarding, Calcaterra says. \u201cWe\u2019re actually treating the underlying cause for their hospitalization \u2013 the opioid use disorder which led to their infection or endocarditis. We used to send them on their way without ever addressing the underlying reason they were in the hospital.\u201d\n\nCost, benefit of a partnered opioid treatment program for inpatients\n\nFor Harrison, that program included a year at Christopher House in Wheat Ridge and, since December 2020, \u201crecovery supports\u201d including a furnished apartment in south Denver, counseling, transportation, and the ARTS clinic, among other services.\n\nUltimately, that costs public money, and that gets us into politics. A commenter below a Denver Post article on methadone treatment summed up the instinctive resentment many feel: \u201cTaxpayers must pay for more treatment options for junkies/addicts so they don\u2019t/wont feel bad withdrawing\u2026 taxpayers shouldn\u2019t foot the bill for weak people\u2019s risky behavior!\u201d\n\nDr. Joshua Barocas, a CU School of Medicine and UCHealth infectious-disease specialist and addiction researcher, has heard those arguments. They\u2019re fueled by a belief that, as he puts it, \u201cSubstance-use disorders and addiction are so stigmatized, and we think of it as the fault of the person \u2013 that this is a choice. People in the general population believe that we shouldn\u2019t be willing to pay as much.\u201d His research focuses on health care cost-benefit analyses of addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cWe have evolved so much as a society that we have to make an economic argument,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough these days to say, \u2018It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u2019 We need to pull people into the conversation by saying, \u2018Look, this actually is not only the right thing to do because we\u2019re human beings. If that\u2019s not enough for you, we can show that this is economically cost-effective compared to what we\u2019ve been doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe results of a recent Barocas-led study found addiction treatment programs such as ARTS to be vastly cheaper than, for example, familiar therapies for chronic health problems such as diabetes. Those figures don\u2019t include other societal costs such as those associated with crime reduction.\n\nThe health care savings from getting people who inject drugs into long-term recovery can be astronomical. In addition to the sort of care Harrison needed, HIV is spread through those injections, Barocas reminds.\n\n\u201cIf you prevent one HIV infection, you save $2 million in lifetime medical costs,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cIf I pay your rent for three months or three years, and that intervention gets you stabilized on buprenorphine or methadone, gets you a job and prevents you from getting HIV \u2013 isn\u2019t that investment worth it? Even if you don\u2019t care about the ethical side?\u201d\n\nCoyle added that MAT keeps addiction treatment in the preventive realm, where it can be managed with medications in much the same way that diabetes is managed with insulin or asthma with inhalers.\n\n\u201cThat ends up making a huge difference in the health care costs, and the health care costs trickle down to everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps people be the best versions of themselves. And that\u2019s what we want because it\u2019s going to benefit everybody.\u201d\n\nPatients with opioid addiction get back to life\n\nIt has certainly benefitted Larry Harrison. When he feels like he can handle it, he will start to taper his daily methadone dose down from 130 milligrams to, eventually, zero. But just as Calcaterra gave Harrison the choice to enter the ARTS program two years ago, the ARTS team is leaving that timing up to him.\n\n\u201cHaving a voice has been a pivotal part of my transition,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nHe is grateful to both organizations.\n\n\u201cI was on the street.

The area has been designated a federal Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) for its lack of providers. About 37% of residents are uninsured and 22% live along the poverty line.\n\n\u201cThe rural counties of Hudspeth, Culberson, Presidio, Brewster and Jeff Davis have limited to no access to life-saving substance use disorder (SUD) or opioid use disorder (OUD) prevention and treatment services,\u201d said Ivonne Tapia, Aliviane Inc. chief executive officer. Through the consortium, partners will be able to leverage resources and expand access to SUD/OUD prevention, treatment, recovery support services, a trained workforce and the creation of a sustainability plan aimed at reducing cost of care for individuals living in the targeted rural counties, Tapia said.\n\nAdrian Billings, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Preventative Care Health Services, also known as Presidio County Health Services, said that part of the isolation of practicing in a Health Professional Shortage Area is the absence of resources for patients and physicians. He said he hopes that this collaboration will increase resources for his patients and the physicians who are caring for this vulnerable patient population.\n\n\u201cOur clinic is the only clinic between El Paso, Del Rio and Midland-Odessa offering buprenorhpine treatment for opioid dependent patients,\u201d Billings said. \u201cOur patients do not currently have access to substance abuse counselors or local narcotics anonymous meetings to augment their buprenorphine prescription treatment.\u201d\n\nFunds will be used to implement workforce, service delivery, and sustainability plans that focus on prevention, treatment and recovery with service providers in all five counties.

Dr. Potter is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, executive director of Be Well Texas, and vice president for research at UT Health San Antonio.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our data are consistent with reports using other methods that suggest lack of certified prescribers is a national problem,\u201d Dr. Potter said.\n\nThe Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000 made it possible for health care workers to obtain an \u201cX-waiver\u201d to prescribe buprenorphine. To be eligible, physicians needed to complete eight hours of qualified training before prescribing buprenorphine, and advanced practice providers including physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners needed to complete 24 hours of training.\n\nUT Health San Antonio researchers sent surveys to more than 600 clinicians who attended X-waiver training courses offered statewide between March 2019 and February 2020. The team received responses from 126 clinicians, including 81 physicians, 37 nurse practitioners and eight physician assistants.\n\nAmong the 126 respondents, less than half (61) had received an X-waiver after attending the waiver training. Of those, almost two dozen were prescribing buprenorphine. Only 17% of survey respondents (22 of 126) were prescribing the lifesaving medication after attending the X-waiver training. This study contributes new evidence that X-waiver training is only part of the puzzle when it comes to understanding the barriers that clinicians must overcome to begin prescribing buprenorphine.\n\nPolicy change last year\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published new practice guidelines to reduce the training burden for treating opioid use disorder with buprenorphine. According to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website, the revised guidelines \u201cexempt eligible practitioners from certification requirements related to training and the provision of psychosocial services, which were previously necessary when dispensing or prescribing buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD to 30 or fewer patients.\u201d\n\nMore than relief of training burden is needed\n\nDr. Potter and the team believe more than this exemption is needed to expand access to best practices in OUD care. Obstacles to adoption cited by survey respondents included, \u201cComplexity of the X-waiver process,\u201d \u201cPerceived lack of professional support and referral network,\u201d and \u201cGetting started with prescribing buprenorphine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure to treat OUD is part of the reason that we have the current rate of overdose deaths,\u201d Dr. Potter said. \u201cAt a time of unprecedented opioid-related overdose deaths, there is now relief from the training burden of obtaining the X-waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, a medication that reduces the risk of overdose by 50%.\u201d\n\nA demonstrated need\n\nNearly 1,900 opioid overdose deaths were documented in Texas in 2020, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. In the JAMA Network Open paper, the authors cited sources that stated:\n\nTexas has the highest number of people in the country living outside of a 10-mile radius from a waivered clinician.\n\nTexas is among the top three states with the most individuals with OUD and the lowest number of X-waivered clinicians.\n\nThe GetWaiveredTX Program, a Texas Health and Human Services-funded initiative, trained more than 700 Texas-based clinicians as qualified buprenorphine prescribers.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to address the epidemic levels of overdose from drugs in the United States, we need to implement a comprehensive approach that includes making it easier for clinicians to treat OUD and reduce the burdens on providing this level of care,\u201d Dr. Potter said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just provide relief from the waiver,\u201d she added. \u201cWe must provide support so that clinicians know how to incorporate this into their practices in a way that is feasible for them.\u201d\n\nSurvey of Barriers and Facilitators to Prescribing Buprenorphine and Clinician Perceptions on the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 Waiver\n\nHolly J.

Among other things, the waiver required physicians to take an eight-hour training program before being able to prescribe buprenorphine. Other health care professionals had to take 24 hours of training.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, it gave the DEA authority to visit physician practices unannounced to specifically audit buprenorphine prescribing,\u201d said Carlos Tirado, MD, an Austin addiction psychiatrist and member of TMA\u2019s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health. \u201cIt created an adversarial environment in which physicians experiencing these DEA on-site practice audits often felt that they were being treated like criminals for treating a chronic medical condition.\u201d\n\nA 2021 rule change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services allowed physicians to opt out of the eight-hour training \u2013 though they still had to obtain the waiver and face audits. Also, those who opted out could treat only 30 patients with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act eliminates X waivers entirely, including special audits or restrictions on the number of patients, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\n\u201cAll practitioners who have a current DEA registration that includes Schedule III authority, may now prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder in their practice if permitted by applicable state law and SAMHSA encourages them to do so,\u201d the agency said.\n\nComplex cases of opioid addiction \u2013 like those with underlying problems with mental health or infectious disease \u2013 will still require input from addiction specialists, Dr. Tirado says. But eliminating the X waiver will make it easier for primary care physicians to initiate care or maintain care for patients who are stable on the medication.\n\nBuprenorphine is a partial opioid receptor agonist that partly activates opioid receptors in the brain (compared with full agonists like methadone and heroin, which activate receptors completely). The medication is designed to stop cravings for opioids.\n\nBuprenorphine also is frequently used in anesthesia and to treat pain, and its qualities as a pain treatment have often been overlooked, says Houston pain specialist Larry Driver, MD.\n\n\u201cHopefully now, people will recognize that it can be used effectively in treating pain,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other thing is, it\u2019s not uncommon that we have a chronic pain patient who has the chronic disease of addiction. So, something like buprenorphine is a medication that can address two issues with one drug.\u201d\n\nBuprenorphine was singled out among opioids for the X waiver because of political and law enforcement concerns over providing access to opioid replacement therapy to patients with opioid addiction, Dr. Tirado says.\n\n\u201cThere were unfounded beliefs that providing more access to buprenorphine would lead to pill mills or other forms of inappropriate prescribing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, buprenorphine is a powerful tool for physicians to combat opioid use disorder.\n\n\u201cRestricting buprenorphine during the worst opioid crisis of our lifetimes probably contributed to making the opioid epidemic worse,\u201d he said.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org", "article_id": "a814e771-682f-4df6-82e8-ad2a825bf8b7", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Here, a female patient in her 50s finishes up appointments with Dr. Amelia Vitrosko and Cynthina Conner, a behavior health counselor. She meets with both providers to receive buprenorphine, a type of medication-assisted treatment.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment, or MAT, combines therapy, social services and medications to treat opioid addiction. Experts says it\u2019s the gold-standard of treatment.\n\nVitrosko and Conner work together to address a patient\u2019s physical and social needs.\n\n\u201cDr. Vitrosko and I collaborate extensively,\u201d said Conner. \u201cWe share clinical impressions with each other and then formulate treatment plans based on that.\u201d\n\nThere are three types of MAT, and they are defined by the drugs are the core of their treatment: naltrexone, methadone and buprenorphine. Naltrexone blocks the opioid receptors, so a person can\u2019t get high, while methadone and buprenorphine are long-action opioids that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn the early 1970s methadone maintenance programs became a major public health initiative to treat opioid addiction. The drug is heavily regulated and by law can only be dispensed at an opioid treatment program (OTP) which has been certified by the federal government. In methadone programs, patients typically go to an OTP every day to receive a liquid dose of methadone which must be drunk in front of a nurse. This daily routine can be a deterrent for people who want to treatment.\n\nBuprenorphine was approved by the Federal Drug Agency in 2002 as a less potent and more accessible alternative to methadone. The drug is prescribed by a health care provider and picked up at a pharmacy. Buprenorphine can be administered at several locations including hospitals, correctional facilities or clinics like Salud Family Health Center.\n\nThe health center has 20 MAT patients in their program, which is currently available at only three of its locations \u2013 Fort Collins, Longmont and Commerce City. Salud provides integrated primary care which includes an array of services including dental, pharmacy, behavioral health, medical, care managers, transitions of care staff and onsite digital xray.\n\nYajaira Johnson-Esparza, director of the MAT program, said Salud\u2019s model reduces barriers to treatment because patients are not referred to another program to receive addiction treatment.\n\n\u201cThe approach that we kind of take, instead of sending someone to go somewhere and detox, let\u2019s get them started on this medication,\u201d said Johnson-Esparza. \u201cTry to set them up for some kind of success.\u201d\n\nCredit Colorado Health Institute / Colorado Health Institute Medication-assisted treatment centers in Colorado.\n\nDespite evidence proving the success of MAT programs, it\u2019s not readily accessible in Colorado. According to a report released by the Colorado Health Institute, 31 of the state\u2019s 64 counties do not have a MAT location and an additional 15 counties only have one. This means more than half a million Coloradoans have no or few treatment options for opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cI think the important thing to remember when we\u2019re talking about opioid dependence, is that recovery is possible,\u201d said Teresa Manocchio who authored the report. \u201cAnd to get people into long-term recovery, we do need to get them into treatment.\u201d\n\nThe barriers extend beyond having specific locations. To prescribe buprenorphine, health care providers must complete a training course and receive a waiver from the federal government.\n\nAt Salud, only 12 percent of their providers have the waiver. Across Colorado, less than 400 providers are licensed.\n\nThe state is working to bridge the treatment gap. In September, Colorado received a $2.9 million federal grant to expand opioid addiction treatment to 17 health centers around the state.\n\nA bi-partisan group of state lawmakers are addressing the lack of MAT through a group of bills planned for the 2018 legislative session. One of the bills would create and fund training for MAT programs, while the another improves prior authorization standards for addiction treatment, making it easier for individuals to get care.\n\nDemocratic State Sen. Irene Aguilar said the latter bill will allow an opioid user, who comes to the emergency room, to get buprenorphine for five days without consent from an insurance company.\n\n\u201cPrior authorization in connection with counseling would be set up so that if people came in, say after an overdose, and were ready to quit,\u201d said Aguilar. \u201cThey could be started on treatment immediately.\u201d\n\nMedication-assisted treatment is a long-term treatment, so Conner and Vitrosko don\u2019t rush their Salud patients into the program. Patients need to be aware of the requirements and how the medication works before starting buprenorphine.\n\n\u201c(We) make sure that they\u2019re in that stage of change where they\u2019re ready to commit to a program like this,\u201d said Conner.", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org", "article_id": "00108a38-4691-4113-a3bc-a0d40a545ff6", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

The growth, coupled with Be Well Texas\u2019 telehealth capacity, will ensure the availability of opioid use disorder treatment services in all of the state\u2019s rural counties.\n\nBriseida \u201cBee\u201d Courtois, MSW, LCDC\n\n\u201cDeaths from opioid-related overdose are one of the greatest health failures of our time, and partially attributable to unfairly distributed treatment resources,\u201d said Briseida \u201cBee\u201d Courtois, MSW, LCDC, Be Well Texas provider network program manager and director of this grant project. \u201cThese types of need disparities led UT Health San Antonio to launch the Be Well Texas network.\u201d\n\nA rural disparity\n\nThat disparity appears to be more pronounced in rural than in urban areas. More opioid prescriptions are dispensed to Texas\u2019 rural residents per capita than to urban residents, which likely has become a source of supply for illegal drug markets and a contributor to increasing overdose rates.\n\nFor example, while opioid pills were distributed at a rate of 29.4 per person living in Bexar County each year from 2006 through 2014, the rate was 88.3 in Young County in North Texas, according to a Washington Post analysis of a database maintained by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nOther rural counties had similarly high rates compared to larger counties: Childress (76.2), Wilbarger (75.2), Brown (68.1), Palo Pinto (66.9).\n\nBexar County\u2019s number was comparable to other urban areas: Harris (35.6), Dallas (28.6), Travis (26.0), El Paso (16.3).\n\nOpioid death rates in Texas might be higher than thought since the majority of the state\u2019s rural counties do not report opioid-related mortality. This, coupled with the fact that state data systems do not distinguish between urban and rural overdose deaths, makes it difficult to quantify the number of opioid-related deaths in Texas\u2019 rural counties.\n\nThe new rural consortium will be a subset of the existing statewide Be Well Texas program, currently serving more than 10,000 adults annually and consisting of 76 contracted Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) and/or Office-Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT) providers delivering substance use treatment \u2013 for opioid use, alcohol use, stimulant use and other substance use disorders \u2013 as well as non-severe mental health treatment and peer recovery supports. Commonly used substances include prescription and synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and heroin.\n\nAligning with HRSA goals\n\nThe consortium\u2019s objective aligns with the goals of HRSA\u2019s Rural Communities Opioid Response Program-Behavioral Health Care Support: to build capacity to deliver low-barrier, digital and/or in-person OUD treatment and recovery support services according to participant needs and preferences.\n\nKey strategies are:\n\nOUD treatment, telehealth \u2013 Rural residents with the capacity for and interest in digital communications will receive telehealth care from Be Well Texas, including medication management, individual and family counseling, medication-assisted treatment, case management and peer recovery supports. Medication will be delivered through the mail or administered at a local pharmacy, and compliance will be monitored and support services provided according to a pre-determined schedule of digital contacts.\n\nOUD treatment, in-person \u2013 Rural residents without internet access or those preferring more traditional in-person care will be able to obtain MAT and counseling from 28 rural providers scattered across the state. Since Texas\u2019 rural residents often work outside of their home county, they can also receive services from the network\u2019s 59 additional MAT and OBOT centers in small towns and urban centers.\n\nRecovery Support Services \u2013 This evidence-based practice includes support and assistance from a person with lived experience of a substance use disorder, as well as wrap-around services. The rural consortium will have access to Be Well Texas\u2019 network of 11 RSS programs (expanding to 18 by the end of 2022), either in-person or digitally, offering a minimum of two recovery support peer specialists or recovery coaches and/or reentry peer specialists per case.", "source_domain": "news.uthscsa.edu", "article_id": "e012df35-c96b-42ca-a968-7a5b9684ad0d", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

It\u2019s a buprenorphine drug that comes in a pill as well as a film-like strip patients dissolve under their tongue. It also has naloxone to prevent them from injecting the medication to get high. Moukaddam usually prescribes the strips. She wishes she could easily prescribe other types of treatments, like once-a-month injectables, in case the side effects of Suboxone become too much for her patients.\n\n\u201cIf a big provider like Medicaid would expand options for medication and long-acting injectables, we would be able to customize treatment for people in much different ways,\u201d Moukaddam said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nIt\u2019s why she and other Texas doctors say they\u2019re watching the state\u2019s Drug Utilization Review Board meeting on Friday. The board is taking public comment on whether to expand Medicaid\u2019s preferred drug list to include other kinds of buprenorphine and medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction. Currently, Suboxone, made by Indivior, is the only one on the list.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment is considered by public health officials a solution to helping the growing number of people in the United States addicted to opioids. There were more than 42,000 opioid overdoses in the United States in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prescription painkillers such as hydrocodone; oxycodone; fentanyl, a synthetic drug; and heroin were most prevalent. While there\u2019s been national focus on states like Kentucky, Maine, Ohio and West Virginia for the opioid crisis, 1,375 Texans died from opioids in 2016.\n\nIf a Texas doctor wants to prescribe Medicaid patients with addiction a treatment other than Suboxone, they have to get special permission from the state. A patient has to try Suboxone before the state will allow them to use other types of medication-assisted treatments. After that, their doctor fills out a form saying why they want to use a product not on the preferred drug list such as for allergic reactions, the potential for harm to the patient or if the treatment did not work.\n\nEvery few months Texas Medicaid requires that doctors go through the process of asking for permission again, which can cause delays for patients needing the medication. This can lead to a patient going days or weeks without their medication, putting them at risk of grueling withdrawal symptoms or worse, relapsing to use opioids again.\n\nLimiting medication-assisted treatment to one brand isn\u2019t consistent with how doctors would typically treat chronic health issues like high blood pressure or diabetes, said Dr. Michael Sprintz, founder of the Sprintz Center for Pain and Recovery, a substance abuse treatment clinic in The Woodlands. He said vulnerable patients cannot always make their doctor appointments, making it important for them to have treatments that they can easily comply with.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about addiction, one of the biggest risks for relapses is right after we get sober, right after we get into treatment,\u201d Sprintz said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTexas legislators in the House and Senate have been studying the state\u2019s opioid problems during the interim period ahead of the 2019 legislative session. The House Select Committee on Opioids and Substance Abuse is slated to release its findings in November. Expanding medication-assisted treatment to other parts of the state has come up during the hearings.\n\nState Rep. J.D. Sheffield, R-Gatesville, vice chairman of the Texas House Public Health Committee, said in a letter to the board that he\u2019s requesting buprenorphine drugs like Zubsolv and Bunavail be put on Medicaid\u2019s preferred drug list and to \u201cprevent Suboxone from having preferred status.\u201d He pointed out that the board should also consider how the federal Justice Department and 42 state attorneys general are suing Indivior for allegedly blocking competition and price inflation.\n\n\u201cFailure to provide open access to the best match to the right medication as determined by the patient and their prescriber runs a significant risk of relapse and serious health issues,\u201d said Sheffield, who is co-leading a group of lawmakers studying controlled substances in advance of the legislative session that begins in January.\n\nIndivior is also enduring criticism because of how easily Suboxone can be traded among drug users. The drug has made headlines for its use as a layover drug for people waiting for their next fix of heroin or other opioids or because they don\u2019t have access to formal treatment.\n\nMoukaddam said making sure patients are not selling or misusing the Suboxone is a \u201cvery tedious\u201d process she and other doctors have to follow at the clinic.\n\n\u201cWe ask them to bring back their wrappers and we drug test them at every visit,\u201d Moukaddam said.\n\nIn 2017, there were 334 Texas doctors who could prescribe buprenorphine, according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nThe federal government limits doctors who prescribe buprenorphine to serving up to 275 patients at the same time. The patient cap has increased in recent years but there are still not enough doctors to fill the need. That\u2019s forcing people with addiction to turn to illegally acquiring Suboxone and other treatments without a prescription.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nAsked for comment about the upcoming board meeting, Indivior\u2019s media team said in an email that the company \u201csupports broad access to evidence-based treatment for opioid addiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to medication assisted treatment has been identified by the United States public health authorities as an essential part of tackling America\u2019s current prescription opioid and heroin crisis,\u201d they said.\n\nFor now, Moukaddam said the idea of prescribing drugs besides Suboxone would be a \u201cgame changer.\" It's unclear when the board will vote on whether to add other medications to the preferred drug list.\n\nRegardless, Moukaddam said she sees the positive side of medication-assisted treatment every day among her patients. They may come in with withdrawal symptoms like sweating, goosebumps, yawning, diarrhea and abdominal cramps at first but once they get their medication, they feel better.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you get the person back, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Moukaddam said. \u201cYou get a glimpse into who this person was in a prior life.\u201d\n\nYou've read 1 article this month.

Courtesy De La Cruz Family\n\nDe La Cruz said she and her husband came to the U.S. in 2007 to give their children better opportunities and obtain better medical care for Rosa Maria, who was three months old at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rosa Maria was traveling with her cousin, a U.S. citizen, from Laredo, Texas, to Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi when the vehicle was stopped at an interior border checkpoint, the family said. De La Cruz had not traveled to the hospital with Rosa Maria because of her own immigration status, an attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union said.\n\nWhen Border Patrol agents discovered that Rosa Maria was not in the U.S. legally, they accompanied the ambulance to the hospital and stayed outside of her room while she recovered from surgery, according to an attorney for the family. They then refused to release her to her parents and referred her to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which placed her in a children's shelter, the attorney said.\n\nUndocumented children are held in custody by ORR, which is run by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\n\"As a matter of policy, in order to protect the privacy and security of the unaccompanied alien children (UAC) referred to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), HHS does not identify individual UAC and will not comment on specific cases,\" the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.\n\nBoth the mother and daughter are undocumented, according to the ACLU.\n\nAfter undergoing gallbladder surgery on Oct. 24, 2017, federal agents refused to release Rosa Maria Hernandez back to her parents, sending her instead to a children's shelter in San Antonio, Texas, that her family said is not equipped to care for her, according to the attorney representing her mother.

The Mexican Consulate has been advised of the situation by Laredo Sector Border Patrol,\u201d said a CBP spokesperson in a statement.\n\nIt is not clear whether there is a deportation order against Rosa Maria at this time.\n\nThe family has also expressed concern that the children's shelter where she is being kept is not equipped to care for her medical needs. Leticia Gonzalez, the attorney for Rosa Maria's family, said her hospital discharge papers state she should be cared for by her family. Gonzalez said Dr. Haroon Patel has been able to see Rosa Maria at the shelter, but not her primary care doctor. Patel signed discharge papers saying Rosa Maria should see her primary care physician within three days of her surgery.\n\n\"In the best interest of the patient, it is recommended that she is discharged to a family member familiar with her needs,\" Patel wrote in the discharge papers, according to Gonzalez.\n\nImmigrants' rights advocates and the ACLU are working to reunite Rosa Maria with her family.

How exactly did this child with developmental delays become the Trump administration\u2019s target for deportation? It\u2019s an egregious case of government overreach, and now the subject of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit.\n\nOn Oct. 24, 2017, Rosa Maria was traveling to Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital, which is 150 miles from Laredo, Texas, where she lives with her parents and siblings. She was accompanied by her 34-year old cousin, Aurora Cantu, who is a U.S. citizen. Around 2 a.m., Customs and Border Protection stopped her medical transport vehicle at a checkpoint in Freer, Texas. Border Patrol agents approached the vehicle and asked to see everyone\u2019s \u201cpapers.\u201d After she and the driver provided their identification, Aurora explained that they were on their way to a hospital and that Rosa Maria needed an operation. She showed the agents medical documentation and explained that at 10 years old, Rosa Maria did not carry ID.\n\nNonetheless, the vehicle was forced to pull over. After a half an hour or so, the Border Patrol agents said that Aurora and Rosa Maria could continue onto the hospital, but that they were going to follow them and once the surgery was over, \u201cthe girl\u201d would be \u201cprocessed\u201d for deportation.\n\nTrue to their word, they trailed the vehicle for the remaining 80 miles to Corpus Christi. Once at the hospital, armed male agents followed Rosa Maria\u2019s every move, including staying in the room while nurses checked her weight and vital signs. They stood outside the open door while Rosa Maria waited to be taken into the operating room. After she woke up, technically discharged by the hospital but still resting in her bed, they arrested her.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection then transferred Rosa Maria into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) as an \u201cunaccompanied child.\u201d ORR has detained her in a facility in San Antonio, more than 150 miles away from her family members. ORR is refusing to release Rosa Maria despite public outcry and serious concerns that the facility is unequipped to address her medical and psychological needs.\n\nCall the Office of Refugee Resettlement\n\nBy arresting Rosa Maria and refusing to reunite her with her family, CBP and ORR are not just inflicting cruel and unnecessary trauma on a child -- they are breaking laws on multiple fronts and violating the Constitution.\n\nStrike 1: Border Patrol had no authority to put Rosa Maria into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has no authority to detain her.\n\nThe William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 allows CBP to transfer \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which in turn, derives the authority to detain \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d from the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\n\nThe law defines \u201cunaccompanied\u201d children as children who don\u2019t have a parent or guardian available to care for them in the United States. But Rosa Maria has never been \u201cunaccompanied.\u201d Rosa Maria has always lived in the care and custody of her parents, who are devoted to her well-being. Her cousin Aurora was by her side and her parents were in Laredo, awaiting their daughter\u2019s return, when the arrest was made. The federal government is not authorized to knowingly and forcibly separate parents from a child when they are available to provide that child with care and physical custody.\n\nStrike 2: Border Patrol made an illegal, warrantless arrest.\n\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, CBP can make warrantless arrests only where there is probable cause of removability and the person is \u201clikely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for [her] arrest.\u201d Again, Rosa Maria is a child with a serious disability who was recovering from surgery at the time of her arrest. There was never any risk that she would \u201cescape\u201d before a warrant could be obtained.\n\nStrike 3: Border Patrol \u2019s action discriminate based on disability.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against any \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d by any program or activity conducted by any executive branch agency, which includes both CBP and ORR. Rosa Maria has cerebral palsy, which is a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. By arresting her, failing to make necessary medical accommodations, and depriving her of contact with her family, despite her doctor\u2019s instructions that it was in her best interest to be in the custody of relatives, CBP acted with deliberate indifference to Rosa Maria\u2019s disability. She has suffered and continues to suffer physical injury and emotional distress because of their actions.\n\nStrike 4: ORR is violating federal protections for minors.\n\nORR\u2019s detention of Rosa Maria violates the terms of a 1997 consent decree, known as the Flores decree, which remains in effect to this day. The decree established several procedural protections for children to prevent arbitrary detention, one of which requires that minors are placed in the \u201cleast restrictive setting appropriate to the minor\u2019s age and special needs\u2026\u201d A further stipulation requires that the government release a minor to the child\u2019s parent unless \u201cthe detention of the minor is\u2026required either to secure his or her timely appearance\u201d before the immigration agency or the immigration court, or \u201cto ensure the minor\u2019s safety or that of others.\u201d\n\nStrike 5: Rosa Maria and her family have due process rights and ORR is violating them.\n\nRosa Maria\u2019s ongoing detention violates both her and her parents\u2019 due process rights to family integrity under the Fifth Amendment. This case involves \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by\u201d the Supreme Court\u2014\u201cthe interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that due process entitles a parent to \u201ca hearing on [her] fitness as a parent before [her] children [are] taken from [her].\u201d Rosa Maria has been in the care and custody of her parents since birth \u2014 a fact known to the government before it arrested her and placed her in ORR custody. CBP and ORR have never even suggested that her parents are unfit to care for Rosa Maria; much less provided a hearing to determine their fitness prior to her arrest and detention. Nonetheless, ORR has now put the onus on Rosa Maria\u2019s parents to show that they are adequate custodians for their daughter. But this is precisely backwards; the onus must be on the government to justify its decision to take the child from her parents\u2019 care.\n\nThe Due Process Clause permits civil detention of individuals only where it is reasonably related to the government\u2019s interests in preventing flight risk or protecting the community from danger. Rosa Maria is neither a flight risk nor a danger. She is a 10-year old child with serious medical needs.\n\nTo add insult to Constitutional injury, CBP has asserted that its agents were required to arrest Rosa Maria for deportation. Dan Hetlage, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said, \u201cWe don't have the discretion. It's not a traffic ticket. We follow the letter of the law.\" That is a lie. While President Trump has greatly expanded the definition of who is considered an immigration enforcement \u201cpriority\u201d under his administration, immigration agents retain the ability to exercise \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d when human decency calls for it.\n\nCBP has also made the Orwellian claim that its actions were done for the \u201cwelfare of the child.\u201d Rosa Maria has been taken from the only home that she\u2019s ever known. Because of cerebral palsy, she requires constant, specialized care, which her family is in the best position to provide. Even without developmental delays, most 10-year-olds would be unable to comprehend or process how they went to sleep at a hospital and woke up in the custody of the U.S. government. Rosa Maria has repeatedly asked her mother over the phone, \u201cMom, where are you?\u201d\n\nEvery single day that she remains separated from her family, the nightmare continues.", "source_domain": "www.aclutx.org", "article_id": "14b5116d-f23f-4da6-816e-208514d57b4e", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

They had to pass through one of several Border Patrol checkpoints set up in South Texas, north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nGonzalez said Border Patrol agents allowed the girl and her cousin to pass, but followed the hospital vehicle taking them. At the hospital, agents stood by and refused to let Rosa Maria's relative close the door to their room so they could keep watch over the girl, Gonzalez said. And after the surgery was complete, agents stood ready to escort Rosa Maria to a federal facility for unaccompanied minors in the U.S. illegally, located another 140 miles away in San Antonio.\n\nRosa Maria is being held at the facility indefinitely, the attorney said. Even if she is eventually released to a sponsor approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the girl will undergo processing and could be deported. Gonzalez said it could be several weeks before she is released.\n\n\"They just refused to allow the child to go home,\" Gonzalez said Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed its agents had escorted Rosa Maria from a checkpoint to the hospital. It said Border Patrol agents were \"committed to enforcing the immigration laws of this nation.\" The statement added that \"once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly.\"\n\nHHS, which oversees facilities for unaccompanied minors in the U.S. illegally, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a San Antonio Democrat, blamed the Trump administration for adopting \"callous policies\" toward immigrants.\n\n\"They're treating her like a hardened convict,\" Castro said.\n\nGonzalez said Rosa Maria has \"difficulty understanding exactly what's taking place\" and is closer in development to a child that's 4 or 5 years old. Her parents are both in the United States illegally and came with Rosa Maria to the U.S. in 2007, when the girl was a newborn, in part to seek better medical treatment for her cerebral palsy. They sent Rosa Maria with a cousin to the hospital because the cousin is a U.S. citizen and could pass through the checkpoint.\n\nThe case is reminiscent of a September incident in which a man and woman in the U.S. illegally were followed by Border Patrol to the same Corpus Christi hospital when their newborn child needed surgery.\n\nAstrid Dominguez, immigration policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said people without legal status in Texas' border regions have long had to decide whether to seek medical care and face detention, including during the Obama administration.\n\n\"This isn't an isolated case,\" Dominiguez said. \"This is a risk they have to take to get medical attention for their children.\"\n\nReport a typo to the ABC13 staff", "source_domain": "abc13.com", "article_id": "ba8bdba3-314c-4c96-8ede-8fedce75fab6", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Joaquin Castro said in statements Friday that Rosa Maria Hernandez was allowed to return to her family.\n\nRosa Maria was brought to the U.S. by her parents when she was a toddler in 2007. The ACLU sued the government on Rosa Maria\u2019s behalf on Oct. 31, days after she and an adult cousin were followed by Border Patrol to a children\u2019s hospital. She was taken from the hospital after surgery to a San Antonio facility, where she was in the custody of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTo get to the hospital, the cousin took her through the Texas border city of Laredo to Corpus Christi, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away, because the cousin is an American citizen and could accompany her through an interior checkpoint in South Texas without being detained.\n\nBorder Patrol agents said they had no choice but to detain Rosa Maria, arguing that she was considered an unaccompanied minor under federal law, the same as a child who crosses into the United States alone without legal permission.\n\nThe ACLU argued that the U.S. government violated federal law on unaccompanied minors and were endangering Rosa Maria\u2019s health by not sending her home.\n\nLeticia Gonzalez, an attorney for Rosa Maria\u2019s family, said the 10-year-old had the mental capacity of a child closer to 4 or 5 years old due to her cerebral palsy. Priscila Martinez, an activist at the Workers Defense Action Fund, said the child was showing signs of socially withdrawing while in detention and refusing to eat her favorite kind of bread.\n\nFederal immigration authorities have faced strong criticism from advocates and some Texas Democratic congressmen over their handling of the case.

He was 37.\n\nEubanks was found in his home in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and his death confirmed by a coroner on Saturday.\n\nThough the cause of death was not known ahead of an autopsy on Monday, Eubanks\u2019 family told the local ABC TV station, Denver 7, he had \u201clost the battle with the very disease he fought so hard to help others face.\n\n\u201cHelping to build a community of support is what meant the most to Austin,\u201d they said, \u201cand we plan to continue his work.\u201d\n\nEubanks\u2019 death came less than a month after the 20th anniversary of the Columbine massacre in which 12 pupils and a teacher were killed by two students.\n\nView image in fullscreen On 25 April 1999, Eubanks hugs his girlfriend during a memorial service in Littleton, Colorado. Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP\n\nHe was in the library of the high school on 20 April 1999 when the two shooters entered. Ten students, including Eubanks\u2019 best friend Corey DePooter, died before the gunmen turned their firearms on themselves. One student died later.\n\nEubanks, then 17, was shot in the hand and knee. He once said that though in hindsight his injuries were not that severe he was prescribed prescription medicines to control the pain and within three months had become addicted.\n\nHe said the dependency was not so much physical but emotional. In a 2016 interview with Denver 7 he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know any better. I was 17 years old, and I had been given medication to feel better.\n\n\u201cImmediately I learned that if I took substances, I didn\u2019t have to feel, I didn\u2019t have to feel the emotional pain.\u201d\n\nIt took him 12 years to find a way out of addiction, and after that he used his dramatic personal story to try and help others fight drug dependency. He became a prominent expert on addiction and drug policy, travelling the country to advise those going through trauma that it is better to face emotions than dull them behind painkillers, as he did.\n\nAfter the mass shooting in Parklands, Florida, in February last year, he had a message for his fellow survivors: \u201cWith emotional pain, in order to heal it, you have to feel it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a physical injury that you can medicate and still recover. In order to heal emotional pain, you have to be present and you have to go through the stages of grief.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "article_id": "b606ead1-0e42-4b46-a0dd-1b24b038f879", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

He and his friends had been ready to get lunch when they first heard gunshots outside. They had not recognized the sound and thought the bangs were construction noises. Then a teacher ran into the library and screamed at them to hide.\n\nWhen the shooting stopped, Eubanks ran through the smoke out of the library, and out of the school. He was 17, with gunshot wounds in his hand and knee, and he had just witnessed his best friend killed in front of him.\n\nHours after the latest school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Eubanks, now 36, spoke about the vivid parallels between Wednesday\u2019s school shooting and the Columbine shooting on 20 April 1999.\n\n\u201cThe similarity here, just in the images coming out in the media, with Columbine, is pretty surreal: the students rushing out with their hands above their heads and the armored vehicles and the police cars and the ambulances on the grass,\u201d Eubanks said. \u201cThis one is really close to home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe primary emotion for me these days is anger,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s because I see the aftermath of what happens.\u201d\n\nEubanks, who works at a long-term residential treatment center in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, now speaks publicly on the links between mass shootings and other violence and America\u2019s growing opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a problem of massive proportions with the rise in mass violence, and I think there\u2019s a direct correlation with the rise in addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he was 17, injured and grieving the death of his friend, Eubanks did not know how to process the trauma he experienced. Instead, he tried to hide from the pain.\n\nWithin months of Columbine, Eubanks, who was prescribed opiate medication for his shooting injuries, was addicted to painkillers, and used medication to avoid dealing with his grief. It took him more than 12 years of damaged relationships, and multiple arrests for fights, theft and impulsive behavior, to get sober.\n\nHis advice for the survivors of Wednesday\u2019s school shooting is to lean in to the pain and grief that they are feeling, and not try to escape it.\n\n\u201cYou can heal physical pain while you\u2019re medicating it. You cannot heal emotional pain while you are medicating it,\u201d he said. Survivors look for something in their lives that allows them to detach from the pain \u2013 substance abuse, negative relationships, technology \u2013 but that\u2019s the wrong choice, Eubanks said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Austin Eubanks with his girlfriend during a community wide memorial service in Littleton, Colorado, on 25 April 1999, for the victims of the shooting rampage at Columbine High School. Photograph: Laura Rauch/AP\n\n\u201cIn order to heal emotional pain, you have to feel it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to feel better immediately, [but] you have to have the courage to sit in and feel it, and if you can do that long enough, you will come out on the other side.\u201d\n\nAlong with post-traumatic stress, Eubanks said, there is also the potential for post-traumatic growth. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t imply you will ever be the same person again. After a trauma, you will be changed forever.\u201d\n\nAt Columbine, 12 students and one teacher were murdered, and two dozen injured, before the two perpetrators killed themselves. In Parkland, after two decades of Congressional refusal to pass stricter gun laws, the death toll is even higher, with at least 17 people dead, including a football coach. The Parkland shooting is the deadliest high school shooting in contemporary American history, according to statistics compiled by Mother Jones, which has tracked incidents going back to 1982.\n\n\n\nBut the effect of a shooting like Columbine or Parkland cannot be measured only in the number of those injured or killed, Eubanks said. The students who witnessed the shooting, the ones who lost friends, the first responders, the family members \u2013 all of these people are affected, and the impact of the trauma and grief can be passed along to their partners and their children, particularly when survivors turn to substance abuse to cope.\n\n\u201cThe trauma, it ripples through society,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would initially start as a few hundred directly affected will become thousands, and, in 10 years, tens of thousands just from this one shooting.\n\n\u201cThese are massive, massive traumas, and it\u2019s like an earthquake, it ripples. That\u2019s what I want people to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy fear is that we\u2019re going to be in the same place that we are every time: that everyone is going to fracture in their opinion and nothing is going to change. If we have a government that is not even willing to fund a study into why this is occurring \u2013 there\u2019s no better definition of putting your head int the sand than that.\u201d\n\nEubanks said he would like to see the government invest in research to understand and address violence, rather than bowing to political pressure to cut off funding for public health research on guns at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as the US did in 1996.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common thread through all of this and nobody\u2019s talking about it. The common thread is isolation, loneliness and adverse childhood experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is it always men? It\u2019s not testosterone that\u2019s doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong in our society and we have to figure out what it is.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "article_id": "c8e9cea9-5821-4dd6-96c7-362f925db37e", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

The center, a subpart of Dell Medical School\u2019s clinical practice UT Health Austin, provides mental health services for ACC students.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had mental health challenges, but with the pandemic, I think it has really significantly gotten worse,\u201d said Ruth Reinhart, ACC associate vice chancellor of student support services. \u201cThere\u2019s a big need for this kind of support.\u201d\n\nThe Amplify Center was created to \u201credesign mental health services to make them more accessible, engaging and relevant to young people,\u201d according to the UT Health Austin website. Reinhart said if students have milder mental health needs, ACC\u2019s regular clinical counseling team will assist them instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReinhart said students who show onset symptoms of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia would receive help at the Amplify Center, while students who suffer from anxiety would be serviced at ACC\u2019s regular clinic.\n\nSince its opening less than two weeks ago, Reinhart said operations have been successful and helpful.\n\n\u201c(Staff at the Amplify Center) are busy,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cI think they were a little surprised because our student population is quite different than UT\u2019s student population \u2026 It\u2019s been very important for us to have that to support our students in that space. It\u2019s been great, we\u2019re very grateful for our partnership because we know it\u2019s really going to help our students.\u201d\n\nDell Medical School opened the center as a pilot program with the goal to duplicate and expand throughout Austin, said Deborah Cohen, executive director of the center.\n\nWhile care through the Amplify Center is currently free, the center plans to begin billing insurance while aiming to keep services at a low cost, said Cohen, co-director for Dell Medical School\u2019s Center for Youth Mental Health.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re working on right now is the financial sustainability of the model,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd so that is what will determine if we\u2019re able to extend out to a larger community.\u201d\n\nWhile Dell Medical School funded the clinic through grants and philanthropy such as donations from the Susan and Michael Dell Foundation, Reinhart said ACC provided Dell Medical School with the office space for the Amplify Center.\n\n\u201cMental health used to be a stigma, and I\u2019m very proud of our society that we\u2019re talking more and more about it,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cGiving students the access and letting them know that we care \u2026 is really important.\u201d", "source_domain": "thedailytexan.com", "article_id": "a72ed6c1-204a-405a-8d29-09bbe6e31a00", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}
{"url": "https://coloradosun.com/2022/04/25/ketamine-mental-health/", "title": "", "published_at": "2022-04-25T00:00:00", "full_text": "Eric Novikoff slid a mask over his eyes, covered his ears with headphones, then sunk into a brown leather chair and floated into the void.\n\nAs the ketamine took effect, the room at the Mental Health Center of Denver \u201cdisappeared.\u201d Novikoff\u2019s body disappeared, too. His consciousness existed in a black nothingness, a space that made him feel as if he could start over, like an empty house waiting for new furniture.\n\nAnd afterward, Novikoff felt an emotional \u201cspark\u201d that he hadn\u2019t felt in months.\n\nNovikoff, 60, was \u201cdopey\u201d all day after that first ketamine treatment, but as the hours went by, he felt his depression lifting. The heavy weight that hung over him was a bit lighter. The urge to kill himself slowly subsided.\n\nThe former computer consultant is one of 15 patients undergoing treatment at the Mental Health Center of Denver\u2019s ketamine clinic, the only such clinic in the state at a community mental health center and one of few in the nation for low-income patients.\n\nThe Federal Drug Administration approved the use of esketamine \u2014 a version of the drug ketamine that is twice as potent \u2014 for people with \u201ctreatment-resistant depression\u201d in 2019, the first new medicine for depression in decades. While some private-practice therapists in Colorado offer the treatment, and a host of clinics have opened around the country, it\u2019s still hard to come by for those who can\u2019t afford to pay or lack private insurance.\n\nEric Novikoff, 60, demonstrates self-administered esketamine nasal spray. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America) Esketamine doses range from 56 to 84 milligrams, taken anywhere from twice a week to monthly. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nThe low-profile success of this form of ketamine to treat Colorado patients with severe depression comes as state policymakers scrutinize the use of ketamine outside of hospitals after the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, who was placed in a chokehold by Aurora police and then injected with the tranquilizing drug. It also comes as Denver narrowly voted in 2019 to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and some policymakers want to make mushrooms legal statewide.\n\nAfter getting the go-ahead from the FDA, the community mental health center stepped into esketamine treatment cautiously, beginning with just two patients in late 2020. The first two men came twice a week for about two months before the clinic opened up to more patients. Now, there are 15 patients receiving regular treatments at the mental health center\u2019s east Denver offices and about as many on a waiting list.\n\nNurses who run the clinic are thrilled to see patients who have suffered for years find some relief, and hope the program can expand.\n\nPatients who come in for their weekly or twice-weekly doses of esketamine, delivered as a nasal spray, can choose one of a handful of rooms to ride out the high. Each has comfy chairs and partitions to separate them from other patients, and one has a wall of windows overlooking a parking lot and, farther away, rows of Denver homes and lawns. Some patients prefer no windows and darkness.\n\nEvery treatment begins with a patient filling out a PHQ-9, a nine-part questionnaire that gauges mental health status, and a nurse checking their blood pressure. A patient takes one up-the-nose dose of esketamine, then a second dose about five minutes later. After 40 minutes, a nurse checks their blood pressure again, and returns regularly to assess for nausea and make sure any hallucinations and psychosis are under control. Side effects noted by the FDA include increased blood pressure, vomiting, vertigo and anxiety.\n\nSome patients report superhuman hearing, like to the point of hearing their blood rushing through their veins or a conversation between a staff member and a patient several rooms away. Everyone hallucinates or experiences some disassociation.\n\nWe have some folks, actually, that have very pleasant psychosis. Denise Hosier, nurse practitioner\n\n\u201cWe have some folks, actually, that have very pleasant psychosis,\u201d said Denise Hosier, the mental health center\u2019s clinical director of nurse practitioners. One woman always chooses the room with all the windows. \u201cWe\u2019ll check on her, and I\u2019m like, \u2018How you feeling today?\u2019 and she is watching some bunnies in the trees, just very pleasant.\u201d\n\nOne man listens to Pink Floyd\u2019s The Wall during his treatment. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I think I just had a really great trip,\u2019\u201d Hosier recalled. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re really drunk. Or they say, \u2018I kind of feel high.\u2019\u201d\n\nPatients are required to stay a full two hours and can\u2019t drive themselves home. So far, only two have quit the treatments \u2014 one was a petite woman who got extremely nauseated from the drug, while the other was a large man who reported feeling nothing.\n\nDue to esketamine heightening one\u2019s senses, Novikoff often brings an eye mask, blanket, and noise-cancelling headphones to his 2-hour treatments. \u201cI\u2019ve had some very interesting enhanced sense experiences, like hearing the blood flowing in my body,\u201d Novikoff said. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nNo one has had a frightening psychotic episode that was dangerous to staff, Hosier said. To avoid this, nurses will talk to patients when they arrive and spend extra time helping them decompress if they\u2019ve had an upsetting or anxiety-provoking day. A bit more time to calm down leads to a more pleasant trip.\n\nPatients typically start by coming twice per week, then drop that to weekly and then, eventually, every other week. All of them have reported decreased depression over time, some almost instantly or within a few hours. After three or four days, it wears off and patients are ready for another treatment, Hosier said. Everyone starts at the lowest dose 56 milligrams of Spravato, the brand name for esketamine, and can move up to 84 milligrams as their treatment continues.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stay in their system for long or make them groggy for days after,\u201d she said.\n\nPatients can continue as long as it\u2019s still working. The esketamine treatment costs about $2,500 per person per month, which is reimbursed at about 75% by Medicaid, Medicare or private insurance.\n\nResearchers have studied using ketamine, which was used by hospitals as an anesthetic during surgeries, to treat depression for the past two decades. Scientists at Yale University found that more than half of patients showed a significant decrease in depression 24 hours after a ketamine treatment, and these were patients who had no improvement after multiple antidepressant medications.\n\nKetamine pushes the brain to make new neural connections, giving patients the opportunity to form more positive thoughts and behaviors, according to Yale researchers.\n\nNurse practitioner Denise Hosier poses for a portrait at the Mental Health Center of Denver. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some really great improvements in people that have not had any success. \u2026 They\u2019re more social. They find they had an affect of [being] very flat and didn\u2019t react to things \u2014 now they\u2019re laughing with family, they\u2019re able to laugh at shows and movies. They just find more joy in their lives in general.\u201d (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nFor most patients, it\u2019s a last-ditch attempt to recover after months or years of depression that prescription medications could not cure. Patients are eligible to try esketamine only after at least two failed antidepressant medications, according to the FDA.\n\nNovikoff tried six.\n\nBy the time he confided in his primary care doctor that he was severely depressed, Novikoff already had a plan to kill himself. He\u2019d gone through a breakup, the death of his father, the end of a computer company he jointly operated, and then the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfraid of what he might do, Novikoff told his doctor of his suicide plan, and his doctor called him every three hours on a Friday night to make sure he was OK. He also set him up with an appointment at the mental health center.\n\nFor the next few months, Novikoff tried multiple antidepressants, but none worked. Plus, the side effects, including feeling drugged and not being able to urinate, were unbearable. Then his mental health center psychiatrist suggested the esketamine clinic, which at the time was just about to take on patients. Novikoff got his first treatment in January 2021.\n\nFor him, it was a spiritual experience, one that \u2014 combined with therapy to unpack the meaning of him floating in a vacuum \u2014 helped him improve his mental health.\n\n\u201cDepression feels like a weight. Like there\u2019s an elephant sitting on you; that slows everything down,\u201d Novikoff said. \u201cWhen that weight lifts, all of a sudden, you can just be \u2014 instead of suffering.\u201d (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America) The PHQ-9, or Patient Health Questionnaire 9, assesses a patient\u2019s current degree of depressive symptoms before each esketamine session. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\n\u201cI was able to really look at my life and realize, OK, you know, some things have gone badly, some things have gone really well and I\u2019ve given it a good shot, versus the depressed me with like, \u2018Everything\u2019s ruined. There\u2019s no future,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat void place was like a spring in my consciousness for me. And when I came back, I felt completely changed. I felt I could still feel that depressed feeling in the next few days, but there was like a little spark that was growing.\u201d\n\nIn one session, the question, \u201cWho is here?\u201d appeared in the void, Novikoff said. So he tackled that one during therapy.\n\n\u201cThat gave me the idea of reviewing my life with compassion,\u201d he said. \u201cKetamine can make you feel loved, peaceful. And so it\u2019s easier to be compassionate when you look at your mistakes.\u201d\n\nAnother time, the words in the void were \u201ctrust the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat felt really relaxing, like there is a path and I just need to go down the path,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to fight it. I don\u2019t have to push forward. I just need to go down the path.\u201d\n\nThe treatments have been so life-changing that Novikoff has given up on the tech industry, which never made him happy, and is enrolled in Naropa University graduate program to become a mental health counselor.\n\nDue to esketamine heightening one\u2019s senses during treatment, Novikoff often brings an eye mask, blanket, and noise-cancelling headphones and will assume a meditative position during treatments. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nHe gets esketamine treatments every other week, usually while listening to relaxing music by Liquid Mind. The scores on his PHQ-9 have dropped from a worrisome 18 points to a 3 or 4, and he feels an emotional connection to life that he hadn\u2019t felt in years, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I was depressed, I felt like I was kind of running the clock out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat moment where I decided to kill myself was a low point, and I feel like I\u2019ve been going up ever since. And the ketamine, by taking me out of that box I put myself in \u2026 it was like the box just disappeared, like hey, you still have a chance to be whatever you want to be.\u201d", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com", "article_id": "6884b6e9-a2f6-43d7-a249-441bed011ccb", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

That behavior that can leave younger users vulnerable to misleading and inaccurate information. Because AI platforms often rely on user prompts as another source of training data, either company could also be violating young user's privacy and misusing their data. This is of particular interest in Texas, where the SCOPE Act places specific limits on what companies can do with data harvested from minors, and requires platform's offer tools so parents can manage the privacy settings of their children's accounts.\n\nFor now, the Attorney General has submitted Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to both Meta and Character.AI to see if either company is violating Texas consumer protection laws.

The inquiry highlights concerns that these AI systems, which lack medical credentials, are misleading users\u2014particularly children\u2014into believing they offer legitimate therapeutic support. Paxton emphasized that such interactions could expose vulnerable individuals to generic, algorithmically generated responses masquerading as professional care [1].\n\nThe probe follows reports of inappropriate AI interactions, including instances where Meta\u2019s chatbots engaged in flirting with minors. While Meta asserts that its AI chatbots are not intended for children and includes disclaimers clarifying their non-human nature, critics argue these safeguards are insufficient. Young users, lacking the critical thinking skills to interpret disclaimers, may be especially vulnerable to mistaking AI interactions for genuine emotional support [2].\n\nCharacter.AI faces similar scrutiny for hosting user-created AI personas that mimic professional therapeutic roles, including a popular \"Psychologist\" bot. The platform\u2019s age policy explicitly excludes users under 13, yet its CEO has acknowledged that minors, including his own daughter, use the service. This contradiction raises questions about the effectiveness of age verification measures and the extent to which companies enforce their own policies [3].\n\nBoth investigations underscore broader challenges in regulating AI chatbots. As these systems become more integrated into daily life, the lack of oversight in areas like mental health care and data privacy remains a pressing issue. The Texas AG\u2019s action aligns with a growing push for legislation such as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which seeks to impose a \"duty of care\" on online platforms to protect minors from harmful content and exploitative practices [4].\n\nThe legal probe also touches on data privacy concerns, with both Meta and Character.AI collecting extensive user data\u2014including interactions, demographics, and browsing behavior\u2014for AI training and targeted advertising. This practice raises ethical questions, particularly when it involves the sensitive information of young users who may not fully understand the implications of their online activity [5].\n\nThe outcome of the Texas AG\u2019s investigation could set important precedents for how AI is regulated and developed. It may compel tech companies to adopt more transparent data practices, enhance content moderation, and implement stronger age verification systems. As AI continues to evolve, the balance between innovation and ethical responsibility becomes ever more critical. The case also highlights the urgent need for comprehensive legal frameworks that reflect the realities of AI\u2019s expanding role in sensitive domains [6].\n\nSource: [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n[1] Title: AI Chatbot Regulation: Texas AG Launches Alarming Probe into Meta, Character.AI (https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/68a36d99bdc32e67c8ca9175/)", "source_domain": "www.ainvest.com", "article_id": "16177181-f60c-424f-98ab-43a049637191", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

The probe, detailed in a Reuters report via TradingView, accuses the companies of promoting chatbots and AI tools that falsely present themselves as qualified mental health resources, potentially violating state child protection laws.\n\nPaxton\u2019s office claims that Meta\u2019s AI Studio and Character.AI\u2019s conversational bots have been marketed or designed in ways that entice vulnerable young users into seeking advice on serious issues like anxiety, depression, and self-harm, without adequate disclaimers or safeguards. This comes amid a broader wave of concerns about AI\u2019s unchecked influence on minors, where bots might simulate therapeutic interactions but lack the oversight of licensed professionals.\n\nRising Concerns Over AI\u2019s Ethical Boundaries\n\nIndustry experts point out that these AI systems often employ natural language processing to mimic empathy, drawing kids in with personalized responses. However, as highlighted in a recent Yahoo News article, such tools can deliver inaccurate or harmful advice, exacerbating mental health crises rather than alleviating them. Paxton\u2019s investigation builds on prior actions, including a December 2024 probe into Character.AI over child safety, as reported by TechCrunch.\n\nThe Texas AG\u2019s statement emphasizes that these platforms may be engaging in deceptive trade practices by implying their AI offers legitimate therapy. For instance, Character.AI\u2019s bots have been criticized for normalizing extreme behaviors in interactions with teens, echoing lawsuits in Texas and Florida where parents alleged harm to their children.\n\nHistorical Context and Precedents\n\nThis isn\u2019t Meta\u2019s first brush with Texas regulators; in 2022, Paxton sued the company over facial recognition privacy violations, securing a $1.4 billion settlement, per a TechCrunch piece from that year. Now, the focus shifts to AI ethics, with Paxton drawing parallels to past settlements involving misleading AI claims in healthcare, such as the 2024 agreement with Pieces Technologies, announced on the Texas Attorney General\u2019s website.\n\nThat case involved false accuracy claims about AI tools for clinical notes, resulting in enhanced transparency requirements. Insiders suggest Paxton\u2019s current probe could lead to similar outcomes, forcing Meta and Character.AI to implement age gates, content warnings, or even halt certain features for minors.\n\nImplications for the Tech Industry\n\nThe investigation arrives as AI adoption surges, with companies like Meta integrating generative tools into social platforms to boost engagement. Yet, posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect public sentiment, with users expressing outrage over AI chatbots falsely claiming confidentiality or licensure, as seen in discussions around deceptive \u201ctherapist\u201d characters.\n\nFor industry insiders, this signals a potential regulatory tipping point. If substantiated, the claims could prompt federal oversight, mirroring the 2023 multi-state lawsuit against Meta for worsening youth mental health, covered in TechCrunch. Analysts predict fines, mandated audits, or design changes that prioritize safety over innovation.\n\nPotential Outcomes and Broader Ramifications\n\nPaxton\u2019s office is seeking documents on AI development, marketing strategies, and user data handling, aiming to uncover if these firms knowingly targeted kids. Character.AI, backed by venture capital, has faced prior backlash for bots encouraging self-harm, as noted in a Washington Post report from December 2024.\n\nMeta, meanwhile, defends its AI as supplementary entertainment, but critics argue it blurs lines with real therapy. This case could reshape how tech giants deploy AI, emphasizing ethical guidelines and child protections in an era where digital companions are increasingly lifelike.\n\nLooking Ahead: Regulatory Evolution\n\nAs the probe unfolds, it may inspire other states to act, building on efforts like the Center for Humane Technology\u2019s commendation of Paxton\u2019s earlier investigations, per their website statement. For now, the tech sector watches closely, aware that unchecked AI in mental health could invite sweeping reforms.", "source_domain": "www.webpronews.com", "article_id": "d86016c7-ef66-444c-a2b1-56708efe8f65", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

One of the many characters created by users in Character.AI has been named Psychologist, but the company said it makes it clear all the bots on its website are \u201cfictional\u201d and \u201cintended for entertainment.\u201d A spokesperson explained, \u201cWe have prominent disclaimers in every chat to remind users that a Character is not a real person and that everything a Character says should be treated as fiction.\u201d\n\nMeta also said that it consistently lets users know that chatbot responses are generated by a machine, not a human, while its AI will generally direct \u201cusers to seek qualified medical or safety professionals when appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe news comes after Republican senator Josh Hawley said he was launching an investigation into Meta when it was recently discovered in a Reuters investigation that the company explicitly permitted its chatbots to \u201cengage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.\u201d Hawley said this was \u201cgrounds for an immediate congressional investigation,\u201d later writing on X, \u201cIs there anything \u2013 ANYTHING \u2013 Big Tech won\u2019t do for a quick buck?\u201d\n\nIn response, Meta claimed the internal document Reuters uncovered and the statements within were \u201cerroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Senator Ron Wyden said the document in question was \u201cdeeply disturbing and wrong,\u201d adding that Section 230, a law that shields tech firms from liability, shouldn\u2019t be protecting companies\u2019 generative AI tools. \u201cMeta and Zuckerberg should be held fully responsible for any harm these bots cause,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn believes the recent reports illustrate that children need to be better protected during this surge of chatbot use. Blackburn was one of the senators who introduced the Kids Online Safety Act, KOSA, which passed last year in the Senate but failed in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nPhoto: Gaga Skidmore/Flickr\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\n\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Kennedy, Jr. over the unlawful termination of $11 billion in critical public health funding. Beginning on March 24, 2025, HHS abruptly, with no advance notice or warning, issued termination notices to state and local public health agencies across the country, purporting to end federal funding for grants that provide essential support for a wide range of urgent public health needs, including identifying, tracking, and addressing infectious diseases; ensuring access to immunizations; and modernizing critical public health infrastructure. The federal funding was appropriated by Congress to ensure the United States is better prepared for future public health threats. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, the lawsuit by the attorneys general alleges that the termination notices are unlawful in several ways under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The coalition is also seeking a temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo and immediately restore the public health funding due to the irreparable harm that their respective states and their local health jurisdictions would otherwise suffer. California stands to lose more than $972 million from these cancellations by HHS.\n\n\u201cOver and over, I\u2019ve made clear that my office will only take legal action against the Trump Administration when it breaks the law. Unfortunately, but predictably, that has happened once again,\u201d said Attorney General Bonta. \u201cCongress explicitly authorized funding for the grants at issue to help keep our country healthy and protect us from future pandemics. HHS and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., cannot unilaterally do away with that critical federal funding. My fellow attorneys general and I are committed to defending the rule of law. We know how high the stakes are in our respective states \u2014 thousands of jobs and key public health programs and initiatives could be eliminated.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Trump Administration, funding for the grants is \u201cno longer necessary\u201d because the grants were appropriated through one or more COVID-19 related laws, and the COVID-19 pandemic is over. In the lawsuit, the attorneys general allege:\n\nThe termination notices violate the APA because they are contrary to law. The foreseeable end of the COVID-19 pandemic is not a lawful basis to terminate \u201cfor cause.\u201d Terminations \u201cfor cause\u201d are only permissible based on a grant recipient\u2019s \u201cmaterial failure\u201d to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of the grants and agreements. The Trump Administration has never alleged, much less demonstrated, any failure by the fund recipients to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of the grants and agreements. In addition, federal law requires the HHS Secretary to \u201cprovide to the State involved adequate notice and an opportunity for a hearing\u201d prior to terminating Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) grants, which fund mental health and substance abuse services. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. provided absolutely no notice or opportunity for a hearing before terminating the grants, effective immediately.\n\nThe termination notices further violate the APA because they are arbitrary and capricious. Among other things, they assumed, with no legal or factual support, that all appropriations in COVID-19 related laws were only intended for use during the pandemic. In fact, HHS granted numerous extensions to the performance period of many grants issued to Plaintiff States and their local health jurisdictions, some of which were scheduled to end as late as June 2027. The termination notices are also arbitrary and capricious because they failed to undertake any individualized assessments of the grants or cooperative agreements, including any analysis of the benefits of this public health funding or the dire consequences of termination.\n\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s unlawful withholding of funds has already caused substantial confusion and will result in immediate and devastating harm to their states, their local health jurisdictions, their residents, and public health writ large.\n\nWithout this essential public health funding, vital programs that serve millions of Californians, including children, rural communities, and nursing homes, will be jeopardized. For example, the federal government terminated over $800 million that the California Department of Public Health intended to use, in part, to vaccinate 4.5 million children statewide and assist hospitals in directing injured and ill patients to available health facilities during all types of emergencies, where efficient routing saves lives. The California Department of Health Care Services is set to lose over $119 million, which the state needs to support key programs, including substance use disorder prevention and early intervention services for youth in at least 18 counties. And the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health will lose over $45 million that was slated, in part, to strengthen the County\u2019s efforts to prevent the spread of measles, and seasonal and avian influenza.\n\nAttorney General Bonta is co-leading the litigation with the attorneys general of Colorado, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Washington. They are joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Wisconsin, as well as the Governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.\n\nA copy of the complaint is available here.", "source_domain": "oag.ca.gov", "article_id": "32d7ea35-d010-42a7-8969-dc8dd5d2e12d", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

In its notice to the state, the federal government said that because the COVID crisis was over, it would instead end all funding this month.\n\n\u201cThese grants were issued for a limited purpose: To ameliorate the effects of the pandemic. The end of the pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants are no longer necessary,\u201d states an excerpt of the notification from SAMHSA shared by the Behavioral Health Administration.\n\nState officials greeted the news with dismay.\n\n\u201cIn so many cases, these are life-saving programs and services, and we worry for the wellbeing of those who have come to count on this support,\u201d BHA spokeswoman Allie Eliot, wrote in an email to CPR News.\n\n\u201cThis sudden change impacts 60 programs across the state of Colorado that provide a wide range of services including: crisis resolution teams, services for adults with serious mental illness, peer services for Coloradans in recovery for substance use disorder, and support for young adults who have experienced an early onset of psychotic spectrum illness - just to name a few.\u201d\n\nEliot said the Behavioral Health Administration is actively working with state leaders, the governor's office and the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Office to determine next steps.\n\nThe Department of Public Health and Environment said that the state is still trying to assess the full impact of the funding cuts on its programs, since some of the more than $200 million was intended to support local public health agencies and Tribal Nations. The money was slated to go to areas like addressing COVID-19 health disparities, vaccines for children and lab capacity for prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that this sudden loss of federal funding threatens Colorado\u2019s ability to track COVID-19 trends and other emerging diseases, modernize disease data systems, respond to outbreaks, and provide critical immunization access, outreach, and education\u2014leaving communities more vulnerable to future public health crises,\u201d CDPHE spokeswoman Kristina Lodice said in an email.\n\nColorado lawmakers are already dealing with a $1.2 billion shortfall and are in the process of finalizing the state\u2019s next budget, which must be balanced. It\u2019s unclear how this federal funding cut will impact the state\u2019s overall budget picture.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Emily Sirota, a budget committee member, said she thinks these cuts in federal funding are just the beginning.\n\n\u201cThese are millions of dollars of planned expenditures. They were planned for, contracted for, and are now being pulled back within the public health space, especially around immunization and disease detection work,\u201d said Sirota.\n\nShe said Colorado doesn\u2019t have the money to backfill the lost funding.\n\n\u201cThere will be very real consequences to real people in Colorado. And we are not going to be able to pick up all of the pieces. And so it's frightening.\u201d\n\nAnother budget committee member, Democratic Sen. Judy Amabile worried about the consequences for Coloradans who rely on these programs.\n\n\u201cPeople who are in desperate need of the services that they provide won't be able to get them and that will hurt them,\u201d said Amabile.\n\nRep. Shannon Bird, vice-chair of the budget committee echoed that sentiment, and said without a partnership with the federal government, the state has no capacity to fund these programs in the way it has in the past. And she reiterated that the money comes from federal tax dollars.\n\n\u201cWhat people need to know is that this is Coloradan's money coming back to us to invest in critical behavioral healthcare needs.

Fortunately, there is a well-established, inexpensive medication that is guaranteed to alleviate the symptoms and reduce the risk of death by 50%.\n\nSurely you or your family member can access this medication readily, yes? If the diagnosis is opioid addiction, and that lifesaving medicine is methadone, the answer is unfortunately no.\n\nThis is the situation people with opioid use disorder (i.e. opioid addiction) who struggle with heroin, fentanyl or prescription pain medications and happen to live in many suburban and rural communities in Colorado face as they seek lifesaving treatment. Methadone, a medication developed in the 1940s, is the most effective medication for opioid use disorder.\n\nPatients who have struggled for years with opioid use say that methadone helps them feel normal and provides the stability needed to improve their lives. Despite the ongoing surge of preventable overdose deaths, access to this medication remains restricted due to outdated regulations that prohibit the use of methadone outside of specific clinics.\n\nMethadone\u2019s restrictive regulations date back to the 1970s and the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d People who want access to treatment are typically required to show up several times a week to federally licensed opioid treatment programs (\u201cmethadone clinics\u201d) to be directly observed while taking methadone. There is little a patient can do if they miss doses because of family obligations, snow or illness except prepare for the inevitable and debilitating withdrawal symptoms.\n\nFurthermore, these programs are geographically concentrated in urban areas. Of Colorado\u2019s 34 opioid-treatment programs, only five are located outside of the Front Range, creating a situation where patients would be required to drive hundreds of miles over a single week to access methadone treatment, according to a 2020 study. For many rural and suburban Coloradans, it is simply not feasible to engage in treatment while maintaining a job or caring for children or family members.\n\nFortunately, there is an opportunity to change the outdated laws governing methadone treatment currently in the U.S. Congress. The Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act, or M-OTAA, is bipartisan legislation that proposes to safely increase access to methadone treatment.\n\nWhile increasing flexibility for opioid treatment programs, M-OTAA will also allow addiction medicine specialists to prescribe methadone for patients to pick up at their local pharmacy, just as they do for most medications. The bill has been endorsed by all major addiction medicine societies including the American Society of Addiction Medicine and specifically empowers addiction medicine specialists to treat patients who may have limited access to methadone because of where they live.\n\nColorado Sen. John Hickenlooper serves on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and has supported the legislation. Now is the time for our other representatives to support this important legislation.\n\nDespite broad support for this legislation by national addiction medicine experts and 20-plus years of evidence showing that methadone is effective when given outside of regulated clinics, there remain vocal critics of this legislation. Some believe that the chemical properties of methadone and the intensive services offered in opioid treatment clinics are reasons to keep methadone limited. There is also concern for over-prescribing and repeating the prescription opioid overdose crisis of the early 2000s.\n\nWhile methadone, like many medications, can be dangerous if used inappropriately, highly trained addiction medicine specialists are well-suited to prescribe methadone in a safe and individualized manner. By removing outdated regulations, M-OTAA would help ensure that all Coloradans have access to safe and comprehensive addiction care from doctors, like us, who are experts in treating opioid use disorder.\n\nPeople could receive a prescription from an addiction medicine specialist in a regular office, just like other complex illnesses, and pick up their methadone from their local pharmacy, increasing privacy, reducing stigma, and eliminating the geographic disparities in access to high-quality, effective opioid use disorder treatment.\n\nBy supporting M-OTAA, our elected representatives can help expand access to lifesaving treatment for all Coloradans, regardless of where they live. As the overdose crisis continues to devastate communities throughout our state, maintaining the status quo for methadone treatment is untenable. We urge our elected representatives to support M-OTAA and increase access to high-quality addiction treatment.\n\nPaul Christine, MD, PhD, lives in Denver and is a primary care and addiction medicine physician and researcher.

Less than 30% of opioid use disorder patients receive medication for opioid use disorder, and even fewer older adults.\nMethods\nUsing 20% national Medicare data, beneficiaries aged over 65 years diagnosed with opioid use disorder in 2017\u20132022 were selected to assess the trend and types of medication for opioid use disorder use, including methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone. In the 2022 cohort (n=69,380), a multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to examine the factors associated with use of medication for opioid use disorder. Analyses were performed in 2024.\nResults\nUse of medications for opioid use disorder among older adults increased from 4.8% in 2017 to 7.5% in 2019 and 15.0% in 2022. The larger increase coincided with implementation of a new Medicare payment policy covering methadone for opioid use disorder. About 79% of opioid use disorder patients had chronic pain and arthritis; 50% had anemia, depression, or anxiety. Males, Black patients, Hispanic patients, older patients, and rural residents had lower odds of receiving medication for opioid use disorder. Enrollees with dual coverage from Medicaid had higher odds of receiving medication for opioid use disorder. Patients with alcohol or tobacco use disorders, anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism, or liver disease were more likely to receive medication for opioid use disorder; conversely, those with non-Alzheimer's dementia, cancer, chronic kidney disease, stroke, chronic pain, or arthritis were less likely to receive medication for opioid use disorder.\nConclusions\nThe rate of medication for opioid use disorder use was low in older adults. The disparity in medication for opioid use disorder use underscores the need for improved access to comprehensive opioid treatment programs and increased medication for opioid use disorder coverage. Additional studies of treatment patterns are also warranted.\nGet full text access\n\nLog in, subscribe or purchase for full access.\n\nGet Access\nReferences\n1.\nShoff, C \u2219 Yang, TC \u2219 Shaw, BA.\nTrends in opioid use disorder among older adults: analyzing Medicare data, 2013-2018\nAm J Prev Med. 2021; 60:850-855\nFull Text\nFull Text (PDF)\nScopus (54)\nPubMed\nGoogle Scholar\n2.\nKramarow EA, Tejada-Vera B.

This has led to the creation of specialty clinics for providing medications for OUD, reducing opportunities for psychiatrists to provide safe, effective medical therapy to their patients and hindering access to treatment for those who seek it. In an era of unprecedented mortality and near-death resulting from a flood of illicit synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, it is critical that psychiatrists take part in providing treatment for patients with OUD and ensure that interventions that reduce harm to patients are widely available. Supporting this goal are numerous changes to federal laws governing the provision of OUD treatment and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority approval of new medications for OUD.\nRecent Trends in Opioid-Related Deaths and Near-Deaths\nIn the United States, over 1 million people have died from drug overdose in the last 25 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), annual overdose deaths have more than doubled in the last decade to over 106,000 in 2021. In 2021, opioids were involved in approximately 75% of drug overdose deaths, driven by the wide availability of potent, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Deaths involving heroin have decreased in recent years as fentanyl has displaced heroin in the illicit opioid supply. Many opioid overdose deaths involve co-exposure to stimulants such as methamphetamine. Methamphetamine and other stimulants may now be contaminated with fentanyl. In addition, fentanyl is also sometimes contained within \u201cpressed\u201d pills that appear similar to prescription medications, such as oxycodone or alprazolam. This means that individuals with occasional or exploratory use of illicit substances may be at risk of fentanyl overdoses.\nOpioid overdose deaths vary by demographic. In recent years, approximately 70% of opioid overdose deaths have occurred in males. In 2021, opioid overdose rates were 38.0 among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native individuals and 34.7 among non-Hispanic Black individuals, compared with 26.9 per 100,000 among non-Hispanic White individuals. Although there is some geographic variation, overdose deaths increased in all but three states from 2019 to 2020, and most states had increases of over 30%.\nOpioid use disorder is highly comorbid with other psychiatric illnesses. According to the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among people who reported OUD, 60% also reported having a mental illness. Of those who reported having both OUD and mental illness, one-third reported having a serious mental illness. Roughly 25% of people with OUD have had a major depressive episode in the last year.\nProviding effective psychiatric care to patients with comorbid OUD and psychiatric conditions involves treatment for substance use. Engaging patients in treatment for OUD also provides an opportunity to identify needle-borne illnesses, including HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). Ensuring that all patients have access to care, reducing barriers to treatment, and providing care in ways that are understandable and acceptable to all patients are critical. Every psychiatrist can provide care for patients suffering from OUD. Recent changes to federal laws and the approval of new medications for OUD provide us with new tools in our shared goal of providing comprehensive mental health care to our patients.\nThe X-waiver Has Been Xed\nBuprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid with high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor. Unlike most opioids, buprenorphine exhibits a ceiling effect on both euphoria and respiratory depression reducing the potential for fatal overdose with the medication. It also has a longer half-life than many other opioids, allowing longer periods of time without withdrawal symptoms. These properties make it an excellent medication for treating opioid dependence, and various buprenorphine formulations are FDA approved for treating pain or OUD.\nThe Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 placed restrictions on the prescription of buprenorphine for OUD, requiring those who wish to prescribe it to take an eight-hour training course, register for a unique Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) number known as an \u201cX-waiver,\u201d and report the number of patients they treat each year. The law also capped the number of patients that each waivered prescriber could manage.\nTo reduce barriers to buprenorphine for OUD treatment, Congress eliminated the X-waiver requirement as of December 29, 2022. The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act removed the previously mandated training, registration, patient cap, and reporting requirements. Now, from a federal perspective, any health professional (except veterinarians) who holds a DEA registration with Schedule III authority can prescribe buprenorphine for OUD where state law allows. There may be additional requirements at the state level, but the federal X-waiver is no longer required.\nIn lieu of the X-waiver, as of June 27, 2023, all health professionals renewing or applying for a Schedule II-V DEA license are required to attest to completing eight hours of treatment and management of patients with opioid or other substance use disorders. This may help address gaps in medical education about OUD treatments. For example, only a minority of psychiatry residency programs provide dedicated training in office-based OUD treatment with buprenorphine, despite a near-universal perspective of residency directors that this is an important training direction. Widening the available pool of health professionals who may prescribe buprenorphine should increase the office-based identification and management of patients using buprenorphine and reduce the stigma of receiving treatment for OUD.\nIncreasing the provider pool is a critical step in the widespread availability of buprenorphine for OUD, but additional barriers to universal access remain. Higher out-of-pocket costs are associated with buprenorphine discontinuation, and although Medicare has eliminated prior authorization requirements for buprenorphine products, most state Medicaid programs restrict the free prescription of buprenorphine, either through prior authorization, adjunct treatment requirements, or maximum daily limits. Beyond sublingual formulations of buprenorphine, long-acting injectables are not consistently covered by Medicaid formularies or private insurance.\nTelehealth Buprenorphine and Prescribed Methadone\nTelepsychiatry has the potential to further reduce barriers to treatment access and expand treatment opportunities to patients in rural locations or with limited transportation. The Ryan Haight Online Consumer Protection Act of 2008 has governed the prescription of opioids, including buprenorphine, by telehealth. In an effort to combat online \u201cpill mills\u201d that prescribe opioids outside of the course of regular care, the act requires \u201cat least one in-person medical evaluation of a patient\u201d before the initiation of an opioid, including buprenorphine treatment for OUD. On March 16, 2020, the DEA announced that it was suspending the requirement for an in-person evaluation of patients with OUD in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Patients could be started on buprenorphine after only a telehealth encounter. This exception was intended to sunset at the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, but it is now under consideration as a rule change by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the DEA. The full set of telehealth exceptions enabling remote buprenorphine prescriptions for both new telehealth patient-health professional relationships and existing ones has now been extended through December 31, 2024. This second extension collapses into a single date the separate rules for new and established patients that had been set out in the first rule extension.\nIn parallel, early efforts are underway in Congress to change prescribing rules for methadone, a full opioid receptor agonist that is FDA approved and widely used for treating OUD. Its long but variable half-life requires careful management during the titration phase of treatment. Federal law and regulations require that methadone for OUD to generally be dispensed only from federally regulated Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs). This requirement creates a highly controlled environment for methadone dispensing and reduces patient access. According to a study in JAMA Psychiatry in 2020, the estimated average travel time to a methadone clinic in the United States was more than 20 minutes one way, and 5% of the U.S. population had a drive time of greater than 60 minutes to the nearest OTP. Rural areas of the country had more limited access to these clinics, and certain areas had very limited access. For example, there were no OTPs in the entire state of Wyoming.\nSAMHSA loosened rules for methadone prescribing during the COVID-19 public health emergency. On March 16, 2020, OTPs were informed that individual states were able to request blanket exceptions so that stable patients could receive a 28-day take-home supply of methadone and less stable patients could receive a 14-day take-home supply. Since then, SAMHSA has concluded that the benefit of liberalized methadone take-home dosing outweighs the increased potential for diversion and misuse. In states that concur, SAMHSA has extended the exemptions to federal regulation allowing increased take-home dosing flexibility. This new exemption allows patients to receive up to a seven-day take-home supply within their first two weeks in an OTP, up to a 14-day take-home supply in their next 15 days in the clinic, and up to a 28-day take-home supply at a time thereafter. This exemption will remain in place until whichever occurs sooner between (1) one year and the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency or (2) the publication of a new federal rule revising the federal methadone regulations.\nFinally, a bipartisan effort by Congress, the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act, is now under consideration. If passed, this legislation would enable pharmacy dispensing of methadone for the treatment of OUD as prescribed by board-certified addiction specialists, rather than limiting dispensing to OTPs. As currently proposed, this legislation would require a provider registration process and would enable telehealth methadone maintenance for some patients.\nOpioid Overdose Reversal Agents\nMost opioid overdoses occur outside of a medical setting and immediate intervention can be the difference between life and death. Community-based, immediate response by civilian bystanders is therefore critical to reducing overdose mortality. Intranasal naloxone, typically available as a single-use, 4 mg dose, represents the mainstay of treatment. As nearly half of opioid overdose deaths have potential bystanders present, improving access to naloxone for patients, family, friends, and first responders can save lives.\nIn March 2023, the FDA approved naloxone nasal spray for over-the-counter (OTC) sale without a prescription, and the first OTC naloxone sprays became available at pharmacies in August. However, OTC naloxone carries a price tag of around $45 for a package of two nasal sprays. (Sometimes both sprays are needed to reverse an opioid overdose.) It is critical to share with patients that they are unlikely to be able to give themselves naloxone. Patients should involve individuals who would likely be bystanders in case the patient has an overdose, such as family, friends, roommates, and neighbors. These individuals should be taught how to administer naloxone, be able to provide CPR to the patient if necessary, and be willing to call 911 after administering naloxone.\nWith the increasing prevalence and use of illicit synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, additional medication options for the treatment of opioid overdose are needed. The FDA recently approved nalmefene nasal spray as a prescription medication for opioid overdose reversal. Nalmefene is a molecule closely related to naloxone, but with a substantially longer half-life.\nHarm Reduction Tools and Financing\nA core tenant of treatment for any substance use disorder is reducing the harms experienced by patients in the course of substance use. Harm reduction is an evidence-based approach that is effective in reducing substance-related morbidity and mortality and a key pillar in the Federal Overdose Prevention Strategy. Needle exchanges to reduce the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, HCV, and other diseases transmitted by shared needles among those who use intravenous drugs is an example of an effective, low-cost harm reduction approach.\nIn addition to these more established harm reduction strategies, there has recently been increasing interest in the use of fentanyl test strips (single-use lateral flow immunoassays similar to home COVID and pregnancy tests) to reduce accidental exposure to fentanyl. The individual puts some of the substance in water and dips the test strip in the water, and the test strip will reveal whether\u2014but not how much\u2014fentanyl is in a substance. It is critical to note that fentanyl may not be evenly distributed throughout a substance (such as a pressed pill) and so the absence of a positive fentanyl testing strip result does not guarantee safety.\nAs of April 7, 2021, federal grants from SAMHSA and the CDC for relevant programs can be used to purchase fentanyl test strips for community distribution. Despite the support of the federal government and the critical need to provide point-of-use information to people who use substances, many states still classify test strips and needle supplies as drug paraphernalia, a holdover from the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d This makes the possession of these items illegal and impedes organized efforts to distribute them.\nAlthough fentanyl test strips provide information to people who use substances and to law enforcement officers regarding the presence of fentanyl in a substance, there remains a diagnostic gap in screening individuals for substance use. There is now a single point-of-care, FDA-approved test product for urine fentanyl testing, but it requires a stand-alone device that is not CLIA waived. There is no FDA-approved point-of-care stand-alone test for fentanyl approved for home use and standard\u00a0drug screening\u00a0panels may not detect widely used synthetic and semisynthetic opioids such as tramadol, methadone, and fentanyl. This limits the majority of health professionals to sending out a laboratory test for mass spectrometry urine analysis, which has a multiday turnaround time.\nBeyond fentanyl, the recent trend of mixing xylazine (\u201ctranq\u201d) into illicit opioids has created a new challenge for both individuals who use opioids and health professionals who treat OUD. The same manufacturers that produce fentanyl testing strips now have xylazine testing strips.\nYou Can\u2014And Should\u2014Help Patients with OUD\nThe opioid crisis has taken a number of forms over the last few decades: prescription opioids, heroin, and now fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Opioid use disorder and the tragedy of overdose have cut across all demographics, and many psychiatrists will have an opportunity to provide potentially lifesaving interventions for patients who have OUD. The good news is that there are more options than ever to provide this care. A changing federal perspective on OUD treatment has permitted more health professionals to prescribe buprenorphine, methadone take-home flexibilities have made this medication a viable option for more patients, and naloxone is available over the counter. Telehealth enables health professionals to treat patients who live far with limited mobility or who live in rural areas. Harm-reduction options enable patients to reduce the potential harm of opioid use.\nThe opioid crisis has been devastating to our patients, and it is important that psychiatrists learn about the interventions that can help patients who have OUD. All health care providers\u2014not just addiction psychiatrists\u2014can learn to use the effective tools that are available for the management of OUD and make a difference in their patients\u2019 lives. \u25a0\nThis information is provided as general background and should not be construed as legal or clinical advice. Clinicians should consult with their jurisdiction\u2019s laws, regulations, and clinical practice guidelines when providing OUD related treatment.\nResources for Psychiatrists\nAPA Resources\n\u2022\t\nIn-depth information on opioid use disorder\n\u2022\t\nResource Document on the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in the General Hospital\nAPA Blogs\n\u2022\t\nHow to Help Those with Opioid Use Disorder in Jails & Prisons\n\u2022\t\nClinicians Resources Roundup: Opioid Use Disorder\nAnimated Explainer Video\n\u2022\t\nEnglish: What is Opioid Use Disorder?\n\u2022\t\nSpanish: \u00bfQu\u00e9 es el trastorno por consumo de opioides?\nOther Resources\n\u2022\t\nDEA list of questions for health professionals who wish to prescribe buprenorphine\n\u2022\t\nResources from SAMHSA for health professionals interested in prescribing buprenorphine for their patients\n\u25e6\t\nhttps://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/quick-start-guide.pdf\n\u25e6\t\nhttps://www.samhsa.gov/medications-substance-use-disorders/ waiver-elimination-mat-act\nReport References\n\u2022\t\nDrug Overdose Death Rates\n\u2022\t\nSUDORS Dashboard: Fatal Overdose Data\n\u2022\t\n2021 NSDUH Annual National Report\n\u2022\t\nMonthly Patient Volumes of Buprenorphine-Waivered Clinicians in the U.S.\n\u2022\t\nTraining in Office-Based Opioid Treatment with Buprenorphine in US Residency Programs: A National Survey of Residency Program Directors\n\u2022\t\nBuprenorphine Out-of-Pocket Costs and Discontinuation in Privately Insured Adults With Opioid Use Disorder\n\u2022\t\nThematic Analysis of State Medicaid Buprenorphine Prior Authorization Requirements\n\u2022\t\nComparison of Driving Times to Opioid Treatment Programs and Pharmacies in the U.S.\n\u2022\t\nHarm Reduction\n\u2022\t\nToxicosurveillance of Novel Opioids: Just Screening Tests May Not Be Enough\nBiographies\nLief Fenno, M.D., Ph.D., is a member of APA\u2019s Council on Addiction Psychiatry and an assistant professor jointly appointed in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Texas Austin and the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas Austin Dell Medical School.\nRobert Kleinman, M.D., is a member of APA\u2019s Council on Addiction Psychiatry and a clinician-scientist and addiction psychiatrist at the University of Toronto.\nVolume 58, Issue 11\nNovember 2023\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nView full text\nNow Reading:\nShare\nPREVIOUS ARTICLE\nAPA Virtual Program to Explore Impact of Opioids on Communities of Color\nNEXT ARTICLE\nToo Little, Too Late: LAIs Remain Underused", "source_domain": "psychiatryonline.org", "article_id": "85d27282-9744-4b5d-8925-996d7d280c57", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Born with a form of cerebral palsy, he wore leg braces until the first grade, but now the 18-year-old is American Ninja Warrior\u2019s third-ever million-dollar prize winner.\n\n\"When I started watching the show, I never would've thought that I would've been able to win the whole thing, especially with having to wear those leg braces and struggling to work on things like flexibility and all that,\" he tells PEOPLE. \"But if you put your mind to stuff like that, you can do pretty much whatever you want.\"\n\nWalker's win on the long-running NBC competition series, which dares contestants to complete extreme obstacle courses, also coincided with new challenges for this season, such as head-to-head racing to the \"Mega Wall,\" which at 18 and a half feet was taller than ever before.\n\nThe Texas-born competitor known as \"Walker Texas Ninja\" discusses how he's trained for ninja while coping with his disability, spastic diplegia \u2014 a form of cerebral palsy that mainly causes \"muscle stiffness\" in the legs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe winner says that although his spastic diplegia keeps his legs \"very tight and twitchy,\" it \"hasn't really affected his gameplay\" because he has \"done so much work outside of competing to compensate.\"\n\n\n\nVance Walker. Elizabeth Morris/NBC\n\nWalker dominated two seasons of American Ninja Warrior Junior, a children's version of the popular show in which he won every race in his age group, before competing in seasons 13\u201315 of ANW.\n\n\n\nThis year, he won the top prize after conquering all four stages at the National Finals in Las Vegas, beating ANW veteran and friend Daniel Gil by just over a second on Mount Midoriyama, an 80-foot tower with a 75-foot rope climb.\n\nWalker says he was an active kid and found an outlet with ninja.\n\n\"I always wanted to do sports, but I was never any good at a lot of them,\" he adds. \"I tried playing baseball and I tried playing soccer, but a lot of sports where you had to be on your legs the entire time, I wasn't very good at.\"\n\n\"The second I found ninja, I knew that that's what I wanted to do,\" he continues. \"I knew that that's what I wanted to fully focus on.\"\n\nHis journey to TV victory began in 2018 after he\u2019d been practicing ninja for about three to four years, and he'd already won a national championship outside of the show. Once Walker heard that ANWJ was happening, he says he \"immediately\" applied with friends.\n\n\"Luckily, I think five of us from my gym that first season were able to make it on,\" he says. \"So my whole entire training squad was able to go on there together.\"\n\nHe adds, \"I had been training for a couple years at that point and doing well at the local competitions. I just decided to take it on the big show and see what I had.\"\n\nVance Walker. Elizabeth Morris/NBC\n\nWalker went on to impress during his rookie season on ANW in 2021, making it all the way to stage 3 of the finals. After nearly seven years in Atlanta, he moved to Houston, where he trained with Gil ahead of season 14. But several stunning defeats \u2014 leaving that season without hitting a single buzzer \u2014 pushed him to work even harder.\n\nAt 18, he decided to graduate high school early and move to Tampa, Florida, by himself ahead of season 15 to train with show veterans like R.J. Roman and Caleb Bergstrom.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\n\n\"I just came down here to test out a new environment to see if this would be the right fit for me to fully prepare for the show,\" Walker adds.\n\nNow reflecting on his historic victory, Walker shares that it was a \"little sad\" that he beat Gil because they \"both worked super hard.\"\n\nHe says, \"I know Daniel was happy for me, and I was definitely happy when he was able to get up there too.\"\n\nAccording to the champion, ANW is not about the cash prize but rather \"being out there with the community,\" and it\u2019s \"a communal effort\" to get someone to win.\n\n\"The entire community [is] trying to get someone on top of that mountain, trying to get somebody to beat Mount Midoriyama and all the stages in Vegas, because not many people have done it before,\" Walker says.\n\nThough Walker has the crown, he reveals he\u2019s not giving up on the competition.\n\nVance Walker. Elizabeth Morris/NBC\n\n\"No matter how many times I win, I'm still going to stick around. [I'm] still going to compete,\" he says, adding, \"I'm sticking around as long as I can.\"\n\nHis cerebral palsy community is also on the 18-year-old's mind. He hopes his win shows that they too can \"achieve their dreams.\"\n\n\"If you just work hard and focus on just being the best version of yourself,\" he says, \"you can achieve things that you would never think possible.\"\n\n", "source_domain": "people.com", "article_id": "99850f8d-d7d0-4a74-800f-bab80989ff7c", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

A manual will be created as a guide for including patients with CP and their families in research,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThis particular project is focused on patients with cerebral palsy and their families and early detection of CP,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt will bring them together along with physicians, healthcare professionals and Early Childhood Intervention policy makers to plan a one-day hybrid conference in the fall of 2024 at Scottish Rite for Children.\n\nRoberts, an associate professor in the School of Occupational Therapy at Texas Woman\u2019s who\u2019s been researching cerebral palsy in children for nearly 20 years, received the award from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) , along with Angela Shierk, PhD, OTR from Scottish Rite for Children.\n\nFeb. 1, 2024 \u2014 DENTON \u2014Seasoned researcher Heather Roberts is hoping a $100,000 award will significantly move the needle on early detection of cerebral palsy, and lead to better outcomes for patients and their families.\n\nHeather Roberts and Angela Shierk\n\n\u201cWhat we continue to struggle with is how to get this research-based intervention into the hands of all the children who need it,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt is not being implemented as a standard of care, and insurance is not covering the cost of it.\u201d\n\nRoberts ran into similar issues with Therapy Together, a caregiver-led intervention for young children that have unilateral cerebral palsy or are at risk for developing unilateral cerebral palsy.\n\nIt was intended to be delivered within a standard of care model with the collaboration of the State of Texas Early Childhood Intervention.\n\n\u201cWorking with the State of Texas Early Childhood Intervention, we found that the children lack a diagnosis of cerebral palsy,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cNot having a diagnosis prevents them from receiving evidenced-based treatment, like CIMT. Early-detection guidelines exist and can diagnose CP as early as 3 months of age. But most of the time, children are not diagnosed until 3 or 4. An early diagnosis is key for optimal recovery. With all of that, we need to start at the ground level and gather all of the stakeholders: MD's, therapists, policy makers, educators, students and, most importantly, the patients and their families.\u201d\n\nThat is why the PCORI award is instrumental. The award funds projects that are geared at bringing together all of the stakeholders, including patients, families, clinicians and policy makers, to participate in the entire research process.\n\n\u201cThis award will provide the resources that prevent many patients and their families with CP from participating in research,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe funds will pay them for their time as consultants, gas, babysitting services or the internet to allow them to be able to be a voice at the table.\u201d\n\nRoberts is planning on OT students being involved either as stakeholders or volunteers at the conference.

The 14-page lawsuit was filed last week in Douglas County Court, accuses officers of lying about the events surrounding the arrest and seeks a jury trial, compensation for Graham and for the officers to be held liable for excessive force.\n\nThe arrest in question occurred on Dec. 7, 2022 near Prairie Hawk Drive. The lawsuit says that officers Coyle and Longuevan frequently interacted with Graham on their patrols. The suit also says those officers knew Graham had cerebral palsy, which impacts his speech and physical abilities.\n\nThe officers say they believed Graham's motorhome's registration was expired and stopped him. During the approximately 30-minute interaction, the officers didn't appear to fear for their own safety, the lawsuit reads.\n\nDue to his cerebral palsy, the 34-year-old has difficulty placing his hands behind his back, which the officers didn't ask him to do in the first place, the lawsuit alleges, yet Graham \"never moved and never engaged in any action which any person could believe was dangerous or assaultive.\"\n\nThe officers accused Graham of being combative in their reports, with Longuevan saying Graham was \"squaring off\" with officers and Coyle writing that Graham \"took a fighting stance.\"\n\nA screenshot of dashcam footage shows three Castle Rock police officers taking Hayden Graham do the ground on Dec. 8, 2022. The arrest and tasing of Graham is the subject of a civil rights lawsuit against the officers filed on May 1, 2024. Courtesy / Castle Rock Police Department via Ascend Counsel\n\nThey took him to the ground while shouting \"stop resisting,\" and then shocked him with a taser.\n\nHe was arrested and charged with obstructing a police officer, resisting arrest and several charges related to the insurance and registration on his RV. He pled guilty to driving under restraint and the other charges were dismissed and he was ordered to pay $154 in fines.\n\nGraham's cerebral palsy stems from his mother dying while giving birth to him, he says: \"I wore leg braces, hand braces, my speech is kinda screwed up.\" At the time, oxygen wasn't going to his brain for three to four minutes. Born in 1990 to a 16-year-old runaway, he moved to Castle Rock in 2007 and has experienced homelessness over the last few years, he says.\n\nThe tasing and arrest, according to Graham, has worsened his condition.\n\n\"My seizures have increased, my mobility has gone down,\" he said. \"It definitely hurt. In my mind was like, 'oh, they're trying to kill me' (...) it was definitely a life-changing experience.\"\n\nGraham's attorney Milo Schwab told CBS News Colorado that the level of force was over the top and that the officers lied about Graham's behavior afterward.\n\n\"Taking him to the ground was unnecessary, tasing him was unnecessary,\" he said. \"They trumped up and really just made up facts to try to cover up what they did.\"\n\n\"This case is about what happens when the police fail to communicate and instead jump to force,\" Schwab said. \"They knew Hayden was disabled and that he posed no risk to them. But they took him to the ground and tased him instead.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Castle Rock Police Department spokesperson said the department doesn't comment on pending litigation. For days, the department wouldn't even tell CBS News Colorado the officer's employment or disciplinary status, but Schwab says the three are still employed by the department.\n\nWhile Graham has had several run-ins with the law for minor traffic violations and a 2022 guilty plea to trespassing, he has no violent criminal history.\n\nLast year, the department was sued by a man who alleged excessive force when a police K9 bit him while he was handcuffed. That case was also brought against the department by Schwab.\n\nEditorial note: The initial airing of the story reported that the officers involved were part of the Douglas County HEART team. While the Castle Rock Police Department partners with the HEART team, the department established its own homeless outreach navigator position in 2022.\n\nPaul Longuevan was serving as Castle Rock Police Department's homeless outreach navigator.

It can be republished for free.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer \u201csilo\u201d services and would instead \u201cfocus on serving all help seekers.\u201d That meant the elimination of the \u201cPress 3\u201d option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.\n\nNow, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois, and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees, and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration\u2019s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as \u201ctoxic poison.\u201d And the administration omitted \u201cT\u201d for transgender and \u201cQ\u201d for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.\n\n\u201cSince the election, we\u2019ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,\u201d said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nNordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.\n\nThe use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts, or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.\n\nCall-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don\u2019t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.\n\n\u201cIf a counselor doesn\u2019t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,\u201d said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project\u2019s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical \u201cbridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.\u201d\n\nEmail Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up\n\nThe White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department\u2019s budget would not \u201cgrant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by \u2018counselors\u2019 without consent or knowledge of their parents.\u201d\n\nEmily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: \u201cContinued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.\u201d\n\nWhen someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses \u201cgeorouting\u201d \u2014 a process that routes calls based on approximate areas \u2014 unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans\u2019 services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.\n\nCalifornia is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.\n\nThe Trevor Project\u2019s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California\u2019s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization\u2019s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization\u2019s capacity significantly, according to Henson.\n\nGordon Coombes, director of Colorado\u2019s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn\u2019t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events, and Rockies baseball games.\n\nCoombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.\n\nThe state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.\n\nNevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada\u2019s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state\u2019s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option\u2019s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.\n\nKelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina\u2019s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state\u2019s 988 call center and other programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,\u201d Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina\u2019s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.\n\nHannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a \u201cPress 4\u201d option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.\n\nFederal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.\n\n\u201cWhat we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis \u2014 when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide \u2014 they need access to help right away,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cRegardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by KFF Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.", "source_domain": "kffhealthnews.org", "article_id": "c3680839-a0b8-4dc5-9be8-b8d097a9817e", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Since 2003, Jack Westfall, MD, MPH, a family medicine doctor and founder of HPRN, had convened quarterly meetings with the Community Advisory Council (C.A.C.) comprising local farmers, ranchers, teachers, students, small business owners, and retirees. Together, they built a track record of academic community partnerships and projects, beginning with colon cancer prevention in 2004 and followed by a series of initiatives that included diabetes and mental health\u2014all driven by\n\ncommunity priorities. Dr. Westfall highlights that this prior work was key to setting the stage for IT MATTTRs. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in and run a study like IT MATTTRs cold.\u201d\n\nSupported participatory grant writing. Working with community members, HPRN spent six to nine months co-constructing the grant proposal, ensuring its goals aligned with community and provider priorities. Dr. Westfall notes: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do it without the people in the network. And they really needed our support and expertise as well.\u201d\n\nDeveloped multi-disciplinary, multi-sector translation teams. Once funded, the HPRN engaged community members from different geographic regions, including the San Luis Valley and its local community advisory group. Together they translated OUD treatment guidelines and messages from jargon-filled medical language into locally relevant concepts and terms. They used the Boot Camp Translation process, a community-based participatory research method developed by HPRN for the explicit purpose of making complex medical terms and concepts easier and more relevant to local groups. The resulting concepts and terms were integrated into the next phase of work\u2014translating national MAT guidelines into a training curriculum and ensuring that messages for the clinics were parallel to messages for the community. While MAT curriculum and materials were developed by an HPRN-convened group of specialists (including behavioral health, pharmacy, a physician assistant, and a primary care buprenorphine specialist), community perspectives were solicited at multiple points during the development process. \u201cThey would go through the curriculum with us and remind us: make sure there\u2019s some piece about how this relates to the patients who are coming from Limon and Sterling and Hugo and Yuma,\u201d recalls Dr. Westfall.\n\nLeveraged a community-driven dissemination strategy. To build awareness and demand for MAT, the C.A.C.s worked with a local graphic designer to develop locally tailored community intervention materials. The HPRN C.A.C. designed the \u201cHave you Met MAT\u201d communication materials; the San Luis Valley C.A.C. developed its \u201cMAT for OUD in the SLV\u201d communication materials. Language and concepts from the Boot Camp Translation effort informed the content. An explicit design goal was to promote conversation about treatment and reduce the stigma of addiction. Local community members distributed the resulting posters, drink coasters, and other materials to local restaurants, bars, churches, community organizations, pharmacies, and schools. Community members also designed a movie trailer for local theaters to play in advance of movies.

(KKTV) - A suspected attempted drugging involving fentanyl forced the cancellation of a Burning Man event in southern Colorado.\n\nApogaea is a Burning Man-sanctioned event held every June in Colorado, according to their website. Over the weekend, they were set to hold their event in Las Animas County near Trinidad. As the weekend kicked off, though the Apogaea Board of Directors instructed everyone to leave the event, and asked anyone on the way to turn around, for safety reasons.\n\nOn Sunday, they confirmed the reason for the cancellation was suspected non-consensual drugging involving fentanyl. They said, luckily, no one was dosed or physically harmed at the event, and no one needed medical attention.\n\nAccording to a post on Facebook, the ordeal began on Thursday when two participants went to a tent to report they had been gifted a substance that tested positive for fentanyl. After the report, Apogaea organizers said a volunteer notified their Incident Command System, which alerted the county emergency coordinator. Organizers clarified they never had custody of the substance and didn\u2019t test it themselves.\n\nOn Friday morning, organizers said a participant noted an undissolved gelcap in their clear water bottle, which tested positive for fentanyl via two strip tests. Organizers of the event said this was found on volunteer premises, prompting concern someone might have been targeting volunteers.\n\nApogaea organizers said they ran multiple more tests and found the gelcap tested positive for several substances, but didn\u2019t specify what those substances were.\n\n\u201cWith the presence of the gelcap reagent tests and the multiple positive fentanyl results, our teams had a high confidence that this was a situation of non-consensual drugging,\u201d organizers said on Facebook.\n\nThey said they dumped the community water in the nearby Center Camp Cafe and Ranger Station as a precaution. Working with the county, organizers said they activated their Emergency Response at 3:45 p.m. on Friday and decided to close the event.\n\nYou can read their full rundown of the weekend\u2019s events below:\n\nAs we clear participants from the property and make progress against our event strike, we want to urgently clarify more...

In 2000, 351 people died of drug overdoses in Colorado, and the state has seen a steady increase in those deaths each year since, with some occasional dips.

It really works,\u201d said Rica Rodriguez, the founder and executive director of Promotores de Esperanza, a community group that distributes the kits.\n\nSpeaking at the announcement made at Denver Health, she said it saved her from overdose three times. \u201cNaloxone saves lives, but access must be equitable. Culturally competent harm reduction is not a luxury, but a necessity\u2026Today I stand before you alive because someone believed I was worth saving.\u201d\n\nMichael Miller, opioid initiative coordinator with Jefferson County Public Health, also spoke of the benefits of the medication. He too is a three-time overdose survivor thanks to naloxone.\n\n\u201cPublic and vocal support for this fund has already saved lives. It saved my life,\u201d Miller said. \u201cPeople like me shouldn't be sentenced to a coffin or to permanent disability. Seconds matter.\u201d\n\nNaloxone saves lives by reversing an overdose from opioids when given in time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioid medication.\n\nOne of its primary benefits is that naloxone is easy to use and small to carry. It comes in two types usable even without medical training or special authorization: prefilled nasal spray and injectable.\n\nThe funds come at a critical moment, Weiser told a crowd at Denver Health\u2019s Center for Addiction Medicine in downtown Denver.\n\nColorado is facing the loss of federal public health funding, thanks to cuts announced by the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Nationally, it chopped a massive sum, $11 billion, that was slated to go to states. Colorado was set to receive nearly $230 million of that.\n\nWeiser and attorneys general from other states sued, winning a preliminary reprieve, but he said with Colorado potentially losing the funding, all bets are off for funding many public health priorities.\n\n\u201cThat's now gone,\u201d said Weiser, a Democrat now running for governor. \u201cIt is so wrong that the federal government isn't continuing to support, across America, naloxone as one of the most, if not the best proven strategies to fight this epidemic and save lives.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s Naloxone Bulk Purchase Fund was previously supported by one-time federal money, he said. The program supplies it to all 64 counties, at no cost to schools, harm reduction groups, law enforcement and other groups.\n\nBut he said a settlement just last week with pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma and its owners the Sackler family, will bring $7.5 billion to states.\n\nIncluding this new settlement, Colorado has obtained agreements committing nearly $870 million from companies that fueled the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic, according to a press release from the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nThe Purdue settlement in principle is \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest settlement to date with individuals responsible for the opioid crisis.\u201d the release said. Colorado will receive an estimated $75,670,000 from it over the next 15 years.\n\nWeiser said with the administration cutting back on funding research into health disparities, which hit African-American, Hispanic, American Indian and other diverse populations harder, it was important naloxone be fairly distributed.\n\n\u201cI want to acknowledge and lift up that Black and Hispanic communities haven't seen the exact same level of reduction we're talking about today, underscoring the work that we have to do and its connection to addressing inequities,\u201d Weiser said.\n\nThe Attorney General and other speakers stood in front of a chart showing annual fentanyl deaths in Colorado, rising to above a thousand in 2023, then falling well below that last year. Deaths fell nationwide last year.\n\nMore than 1,600 people died from overdoses of all kinds last year in Colorado. But public health officials say wide distribution of naloxone is preventing the number from being much higher.\n\n\u201cWhile that\u2019s still far too many people, it is encouraging to see that deaths from overdoses decreased 14 percent compared to the previous year,\u201d said Donna Lynne, Denver Health\u2019s CEO.\n\nThe $3 million from the AG's office won't meet the full statewide need for naloxone but it ensures that high priority groups are funded through 2026, according to a spokesman.\n\nBrooke Bender, administrative director with Denver Health\u2019s Center for Addiction Medicine, said the hospital offers naloxone across its entire system. And it recently opened a new vending machine, called VENDY.\n\n\u201cWe aim to de-stigmatize addiction treatment and harm reduction tools to make them accessible and to keep people alive and help them thrive,\u201d Bender said.\n\n'It's a nightmare. Everybody in our community is on edge.'\n\nJohn Daley/CPR Rica Rodriguez is the founder and executive director of Promotores de Esperanza, a community group that distributes kits of naloxone, which also goes by the name Narcan\n\nRodiguez, with Promotores de Esperanza, said the funding comes just in time. Her group had seen a $115,000 cut to funding from the city of Denver specifically for Narcan distribution. \u201cSo we won't be able to pay our contractors, to be able to do the work,\u201d she said.\n\nWith that grant, her group distributed 5,900 doses of naloxone last year.\n\n\u201cBut thankfully with the bulk fund supply, we will still have access to the Narcan and we will make it happen and we'll find funding to make it happen,\u201d she said.\n\nThe sudden loss of a lot of federal funds is hitting the community hard, she said.\n\n\u201cIt's a nightmare. Everybody in our community is on edge. Everybody is wondering what's going to happen when I don't have access to Narcan and my son overdoses or my grandson overdoses, or even my grandmother,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nShe said knew a grandmother who overdosed because she forgot that she took her pain medicine, then took another one and overdosed, not realizing that she forgot.\n\n\u201cThankfully, her grandson had been there and had Narcan on board and saved her life,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cSo everybody's just in total chaos right now. Just wondering what's going to happen, especially with Medicaid funding and all the other cuts that are happening.\u201d\n\nRodriguez said she\u2019s been sober for 19 years, after using heroin and opioids. Three times she overdosed on prescription pills but had the overdose reversed, thanks to naloxone, which was only available on the black market then.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely an enabler of breathing. That's all it enables,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople like to say that it enables drug usage, but it absolutely does not. It just keeps people alive so that we can find a pathway to recovery. And if we're not breathing, then we can't find recovery.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org", "article_id": "deec7c1f-b55a-43f1-a908-ee001701b857", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

(Faith Miller/Colorado Newsline)\n\nDespite extensive budget cuts necessitated by COVID-19, Colorado legislators managed to avoid what one lawmaker said would have been a major setback for the state\u2019s opioid response.\n\n\u201cWhat we were looking at initially was going back 10 years on this issue and completely decimating any progress that we\u2019ve made,\u201d says Sen. Brittany Pettersen (D-Lakewood). \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t believe how much we were able to save.\u201d\n\n Sen. Brittany Pettersen represents the 22nd District in the Colorado Senate. (leg.colorado.gov)\n\nInitial cuts proposed by the Joint Budget Committee would have removed $43 million in funding for substance use disorder prevention and treatment, according to figures provided by the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention.\n\nTreatment advocates salvaged more than half of that \u2014 $22 million \u2014 in the final budget, with some help from federal grants and COVID-19 relief funds.\n\nMuch of the legislation that originally included help for the opioid crisis had been developed in previous years by the Opioid and Other Substance Use Disorders Study Committee, which heard from stakeholders such as treatment providers, insurers and people in recovery from substance use.\n\n\u201cWe are now expecting 75,000 additional deaths because of drug misuse and overdoses and suicide. \u2026 It was always urgent, and now it\u2019s even more urgent, that we step up and address this at every level,\u201d Pettersen, who chairs the committee, said at a virtual bill signing in July for some of the new legislation.\n\nWhile Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bill that would have required insurers to cover alternatives to opioids for pain management and extended prescribing limits on the highly addictive drugs, he signed major legislation that removed barriers for syringe access programs, improves coverage for substance use disorders, and ensures Medicaid enrollment for people released from jail or prison.\n\nThe legislation is especially important, advocates say, because the pandemic and associated economic downturn could lead many to turn to abusing prescriptions, alcohol or street drugs \u2014 burdening the already-overwhelmed treatment system and leading to a surge in overdose deaths, which hit an all-time high of nearly 71,000 in 2019 after a brief decline the previous year.\n\nRead on for a summary of COVID-19-era victories and losses for legislators working to improve the state\u2019s response to the national opioid crisis.\n\nGreater access to clean syringes\n\nOne major win for advocates of harm reduction \u2014 a term that connotes reducing health risks associated with addiction, rather than implementing zero-tolerance policies \u2014 came with House Bill 20-1065.\n\nSponsored by Democratic Reps. Chris Kennedy of Lakewood and Leslie Herod of Denver, the bill requires insurers that cover the opioid reversal drug naloxone to reimburse hospitals when it\u2019s provided to patients upon their release from an emergency department. The bill also contains explicit authorization for pharmacists to sell clean syringes.\n\nA more controversial provision of the bill creates a new process through which the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment can approve syringe access programs without the consent of local health departments.\n\nSuch programs provide people who inject drugs with clean syringes while providing them free naloxone, fentanyl test strips, education on how to inject safely, and resources for getting into treatment when they\u2019re ready. Previously, such programs needed approval from local health departments \u2014 which sometimes reject them despite the fact that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides funding to help pay for the programs.\n\n\u201cPeople end up with fewer infections, they go to the hospital less \u2014 people do a lot better if there are syringe access programs in their location,\u201d says Dr. Robert Valuck, executive director of the Colorado Consortium for Drug Abuse Prevention. \u201cMany parts of the country are really expanding them, other parts of the country are not. It\u2019s a controversial topic.\u201d\n\nThe El Paso County Board of Health, which has stood firm against allowing syringe access, voted unanimously in March to oppose the bill on the grounds that it \u201cunnecessarily removes local control over issues of local public health concern.\u201d\n\nCDPHE will need to promulgate rules governing a new approval process for syringe access programs, Valuck says, so it could be months before any proposals are heard by the state.\n\nCoverage for inpatient treatment and detox\n\nWhen Pettersen\u2019s mother was struggling with an opioid use disorder that nearly killed her, she said she discovered that Medicaid doesn\u2019t pay for inpatient substance use treatment.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that that wasn\u2019t covered \u2026 and so we brought the (Medicaid) waiver process, which took two years before it would actually be implemented,\u201d Pettersen said.\n\nIn 2018, legislators passed a bill that would have provided Medicaid coverage, pending federal approval of a new waiver, for substance use and detox treatment starting in the fiscal year that began July 1, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt had to be kicked back six months just because of the enormous pressure that Medicaid\u2019s under right now with all of the people who are new enrollees,\u201d Pettersen said.\n\nBut the delay could have been much longer. The legislation would have cost $17.5 million for the fiscal year, and since it hadn\u2019t been implemented by the time budget cuts were being considered in the spring, it was one of the first programs on the chopping block.\n\nThe Joint Budget Committee proposed delaying the program for an entire year, which, Pettersen said, probably would have meant additional years of delays. Now, it\u2019ll be implemented in January, saving the state $9 million for the fiscal year.\n\nAnother bill takes a similar step for insurance plans under Colorado\u2019s oversight, which cover about 30% of the population, Pettersen said.\n\nCurrently, though the Affordable Care Act mandates coverage for substance use treatment, it doesn\u2019t specify what that means. The result is that many health plans only cover five days of inpatient treatment, which is \u201ccompletely insufficient,\u201d Pettersen said.\n\nSenate Bill 20-7, sponsored by Pettersen and Sen. Faith Winter (D-Westminster) will change that.\n\nIt requires insurers to follow the American Society of Addiction Medicine criteria, which Pettersen has called the \u201cgold standard\u201d for substance use treatment.\n\nAfter the Medicaid waiver takes effect in January and SB-7 mandates those new standards starting the following year, more than half of the state\u2019s population \u201cwill no longer be told, \u2018I\u2019m sorry we have nowhere to send you,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re struggling, but no, we don\u2019t cover that\u2019\u201d when they seek treatment for substance use disorders, she said.\n\nSB-7 also streamlines the process for having someone involuntarily committed for substance use treatment, aligning state statutes for alcohol and drug use, and defines patient rights.\n\nBesides that, the Consortium \u201cfought like heck\u201d against budget committee staff\u2019s proposal to cut a $2.5 million medication-assisted treatment pilot program created through 2019 legislation, Valuck said.\n\nThe program \u2014 which was preserved with full funding \u2014 serves people in rural areas of the state with limited access to treatment that involves using medication, such as buprenorphine or methadone, to treat substance use disorders.\n\n\u201c(The bill) expanded treatment in the San Luis Valley and Pueblo and Routt counties, and then we brought in a few other areas, like Gunnison and Montrose,\u201d Valuck said. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019re getting hundreds of new patients treated in those areas because of this funding.\u201d\n\nSubstance use treatment in the criminal justice system\n\nAnother victory came with Polis\u2019 July 13 signing of House Bill 20-1017, sponsored by Reps. Herod and Kennedy.\n\n State Rep. Leslie Herod, from Colorado\u2019s 8th District.\n\nThe bill \u201cmakes sure that people in our jails, community corrections and prisons have access to better treatment, so when they get out, they\u2019re clean, and they can regain their dignity and their lives,\u201d Polis said at the time.\n\nOriginally, HB-1017 would have required jails and prisons to provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder to inmates. The final version merely encourages the practice, but it also requires jails to provide people with Medicaid re-enrollment paperwork and file that paperwork with the county health department upon their release.\n\n\u201cRight now, in Colorado, our largest treatment facilities are our jails and our prisons. That should not stand,\u201d Herod said at the bill signing.\n\nWhile HB-1017 wouldn\u2019t change that dynamic, \u201cwhat it will do is put Coloradans on the right path to recovery, and ensure that there\u2019s a continuity of care for those who need it,\u201d she said.\n\nFinally, the state Office of Behavioral Health designated some federal COVID-19 relief funding to a program for co-responder teams, a criminal justice diversion practice that pairs law enforcement officers with behavioral health workers to help de-escalate situations that stem from mental health concerns or substance use disorders.\n\nAdditional funding for medication-assisted treatment in jails, which would have been cut under budget staff\u2019s proposal, is expected to be replaced by a State Opioid Response grant that OBH applied for from the federal government.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that when \u2026 we have those people in custody, that we are getting them the care that they need, is critical for saving lives,\u201d Pettersen said.\n\nREPUBLISH\n\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Company officials say another $2 billion and three years will extend service to Orlando International Airport.\n\nWes Edens, co-founder, principal and co-chief executive officer of Brightline owner Fortress Investment Group, says that his firm has a vision \u201cwell beyond the state of Florida\u201d for corridors that share the same characteristics of the cities Brightline connects in Florida -- \u201ctoo far to drive, too short to fly.\u201d\n\nBrightline president and chief operating officer Patrick Goddard, in an interview with Florida Trend, made clear that Brightline hopes to be the one to implement privately owned intercity service in new corridors nationally to address the nation\u2019s traffic congestion problems. Such service disappeared in America in the last century. \u201cWe absolutely think that we now have the blueprint, we\u2019ve got the playbook,\u201d Goddard said. \u201cThis is the proof of concept that we can actually get this done with private capital.\u201d\n\nGoddard said adding service in new regions would require working through a host of issues.

We believe we\u2019ve got the playbook to do it again.\u201d\n\nDallas-Houston is the \u201cmost obvious\u201d place for private passenger service, he said, but he also cited Charlotte-Atlanta and Chicago-St. Louis. \u201cThere are others that we\u2019re evaluating,\u201d Goddard said.\n\nA question mark around Brightline has been whether the service will prove commercially viable. To date, Brightline hasn\u2019t revealed ridership numbers for its West Palm Beach-Fort Lauderdale leg, which has been open since January, but company officials have said they\u2019re pleased with the response to the service. A desire to expand to new corridors provides an indication the service will work financially.\n\n\u201cThis is a model that is commercially viable,\u201d Edens says.", "source_domain": "www.floridatrend.com", "article_id": "b5d07448-60f4-48c2-9861-785d03cf5187", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Phil Henning of Sacred Heart Catholic Church denied Kevin his first reception of the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, Henning said the boy had \"the mental capacity of a 6-month old\" and didn't have \"sufficient knowledge of Christ\" to participate in the religious rite, even though Catholic doctrine doesn't specify what level of knowledge is adequate.\n\nKevin's grandmother, Irma Castro, said Kevin had prepared for months for the \"religious milestone\" only to be offered a ritual for those who are sick.\n\n\"That is the anointing they give you before death,\" his grandmother told ABC's affiliate KSAT. \"That was very offensive.\"\n\nKevin's family cried \"discrimination.\"\n\nCerebral palsy can include any number of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination but don't worsen over time, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIt is the most common motor disorder in children and is second only to autism as the most common disability in children, according to United Cerebral Palsy, an organization that provides education and support for people with a spectrum of disabilities. Each year about 10,000 babies born in the United States will develop cerebral palsy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It affects boys more frequently than girls.\n\nCerebral palsy, though, is not always associated with intellectual disability. \"It's not the same as intellectual disability, and it does not cause intellectual disability,\" said Chris Thomson, general counsel for UCP. \"Individuals who have cerebral palsy can also have intellectual disability. But one does not cause the other and they are separate conditions.\"\n\nIt can, however, come with its share of misunderstanding and discrimination, like the kind Kevin Castro experienced in his church.\n\n\"Faith is an important part of people's lives, and we hope that his church and family can find a solution that allows Kevin to be an active and full participant of his faith community,\" said Stephen Bennett, president and CEO of UCP. \"UCP is committed to full citizenship for people with disabilities, regardless of the severity and expression.\"\n\n\"Without knowing [Kevin's] medical diagnosis, it is impossible to know what he may be experiencing,\" said Thomson. \"But people often mistakenly confuse cerebral palsy for an intellectual disability because of the symptoms they witness, such a slurred speech, drooling or spasticity.\"\n\nIrma Castro said that she had been helping to prepare Kevin for months for his communion, and the priest's decision had shaken her faith. \"I hurt for my grandson and my family,\" she said.\n\nFirst Communion Is Important Rite\n\nThe important ceremony means the child has been embraced by the church community. and it is accompanied by traditional family celebrations and gifts.\n\nDeacon Pat Rodgers, from the Archdiocese of San Antonio, told ABCNews.com that the decision whether to give the sacrament lies with the local priest, but emphasized, \"It's never our desire, hope or wish to withhold a sacrament from someone who wants or needs it.\"\n\nHenning's church offices were closed Tuesday, and he did not return messages left by ABCNews.com.", "source_domain": "abcnews.go.com", "article_id": "71e45a92-428b-4fb6-99ec-c0fc769cb690", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Unmotivated, increasingly cynical, or detached from coworkers? If so, you may be on the road to burnout.\n\nYes, burnout is real and is now a legitimate medical diagnosis according to the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) handbook, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), that guides medical providers in diagnosing diseases.\n\nDr. Frank Drummond, chief medical officer of behavioral health services at HCA Healthcare, explained that burnout has been since 2003 classified as a symptom \u2013 a problem related to life management \u2013 but was recently updated as a syndrome.\n\nWHO has now re-labeled the designation from a \u201cstate\u201d of exhaustion to a \u201csyndrome\u201d resulting from \u201cchronic workplace stress.\u201d\n\nAppearing in the new version of the ICD-11, which will go into effect in January 2022, the official definition of burnout states:\n\n\u201cBurnout is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic\n\nworkplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is\n\ncharacterized by three dimensions: 1) feelings of energy depletion\n\nor exhaustion; 2) increased mental distance from one\u2019s job, or\n\nfeelings of negativism or cynicism related to one\u2019s job; and 3) reduced\n\nprofessional efficacy.\u201d\n\nThe Genesis of Burnout\n\nIn 1974, psychologist Herbert Freudenberger became the first to coin \u2018burnout\u2019 in a medical journal, after studying the lasting impact of excessive stress and workplace demands on individuals, resulting in symptoms like depression.\n\nIn other words, burnout isn\u2019t a new phenomenon, nor does it appear overnight. A recent Gallup poll found that \u201c23% of employees reported feeling burned out at work very often or always, while an additional 44% reported feeling burned out sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that burnout is an \u2018official\u2019 diagnosis will hopefully translate to greater education and awareness around quality of life for those in the workforce,\u201d said Dr. Drummond. \u201cAnd, for professionals working in behavioral health, and others in the medical community, we hope this new designation and conversation around burnout will encourage people to seek treatment and reach out for help.\u201d\n\nDr. Drummond and Cordett McCall, a licensed mental health counselor and clinical manager of behavioral health at HCA Healthcare affiliate Largo Medical Center, tag team to help us dive deeper into this \u201coccupational phenomenon\u201d and provide tools to deal with burnout before hitting rock bottom.\n\nCordett McCall serves as a licensed counselor and certified addiction specialist in the HCA Healthcare West Florida Division.\n\nWhat is the difference between stress and burnout?\n\nEveryone deals with stress at some point in their lives. It\u2019s a normal physical and psychological response to sudden dangers and long-lasting challenges, Dr. Drummond said in the HCA Healthcare Today article \u201cStress, the health epidemic of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nBurnout, on the other hand, is the result of unrelenting stress. People experiencing burnout often feel mentally exhausted, disconnected, unproductive \u2013 doesn\u2019t care about one\u2019s work \u2013 and inefficient at tasks, Dr. Drummond explained.\n\nWhen does burnout occur?\n\nBurnout happens when passion is replaced by repetition, quality with quantity, and empathy with hopelessness, says McCall. When that desire to do the thing a person most loves professionally becomes a daunting task and they no longer find it rewarding, that\u2019s a sign of burnout.\n\nHow can a medical professional diagnose someone with burnout?\n\nSymptoms that manifest clearly in employees who are burned out include:\n\nemotional exhaustion\n\npessimism or negativity towards everything, particularly at work,\n\nlack of empathy\n\ndetachment from co-workers\n\npowerlessness or feeling as if nothing you do makes a difference; being \u201cchecked out\u201d\n\na perception of being worse at your job than you were before\n\nThese are especially easy to detect when these behaviors are not characteristic of how the employees used to behave or present, says McCall.\n\nDr. Drummond also noted other symptoms that are physical in nature including, recurrent illnesses, such as colds or a lowered immune system, frequent headaches or muscle pains, and changes in appetite.\n\nWhat are the causes of burnout?\n\nMcCall explained that knowing limitations are important. Attempting to meet everyone\u2019s demands all the time is unrealistic and can lead to burnout. Examples that could cause burnout include:\n\nsaying \u201cyes\u201d to everyone\n\nsacrificing personal time, breaks or even taking a lunch\n\nshifting personal priorities to meet work demands (work-life imbalance)\n\ninability to have stress relief as part of everyday life\n\nExcessive levels of stress can also lead to burnout, Dr. Drummond added, as well as undefined job descriptions and feelings of inadequacy or an ability to perform at a level that one is accustomed to.\n\nAccording to this CNBC article, unfair treatment at work, unreasonable deadlines, unmanageable workload and lack of support from managers also cause burnout. The writer also added that the stress that comes with 24/7 access to work, through emails and texts, and expectations to respond at off-hours compounds burnout.\n\nConsequences of job burnout?\n\nBurnout can produce a myriad of consequences. Depression, anxiety, decreased immune system from stress which leads to more sick days, impaired judgment (burnout individuals just don\u2019t care), which can cause critical errors at work, sleep disturbances, decreased efficacy\u2026the list goes on.\n\nIs burnout limited to professional work?\n\nAnytime someone has a passion for something, coupled with a loss of control to express that passion independently, burnout is inevitable, says McCall. Other contributing burnout factors include expectations to produce repetitious results, receiving minimal recognition and a focus on quantity versus quality. Stay-at-home moms, religious leaders or volunteers can be susceptible to burnout if these variables are present.\n\nRisk factors?\n\nAn individual might be more likely to experience burnout if they:\n\ndon\u2019t work well under pressure\n\nstruggle with anxiety, depression\n\nhave a perfectionist viewpoint\n\nWork life balance is important to managing burnout.\n\nHow to manage burnout?\n\nThere are so many things that can be done to manage burnout but first, the individual has to be aware that it can happen to them.\n\nMcCall suggests individuals start to cope by:\n\ngetting a hobby or exercising\n\ntalking to a therapist\n\ndeveloping a support network\n\nsetting up self-care and life goals\n\nmaintaining balance\n\nPeople can also deal with the road to burnout, according to Dr. Drummond, by:\n\nreevaluating their life or career choices and looking at the things that are causing burnout\n\nimproving the amount of interpersonal or personally gratifying activities they\u2019re involved in to balance the amount of time spent at work\n\ntaking time off of work\n\n\u201cIt can be difficult to differentiate everyday stress to a full point of burnout,\u201d Dr. Drummond noted. \u201cBut if you\u2019re feeling stressed and out of balance, don\u2019t wait. It\u2019s still useful to reach out for help either through a therapist or through your company\u2019s Employee Assistance Program (EAP).\u201d\n\nMcCall hopes this new classification and conversation will allow people to identify burnout, help prevent it for others, and provide resources to recover from this emotionally draining experience called burnout.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "5ab9cd3b-3fa9-462d-8fd0-b33606a77422", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

If ibogaine demonstrates both safety and efficacy, it could facilitate treatment access to millions of Americans suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD) and other mental health conditions. We believe that Senate Bill 2308 provides a sensible regulatory pathway for the advancement of ibogaine as a potential treatment for OUD, co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD), and other relevant neurological or mental health conditions.\n\nTexas can lead the nation in innovative mental health and addiction care solutions with this bill. Senate Bill 2308 prioritizes patient safety and scientific rigor. There are strict requirements for all applicants wishing to conduct trials. To be eligible for the grant, applicants must be private corporation entities with enough capacity and financial resources to conduct FDA trials, seek FDA approval, and conduct future trials. Applicants must also provide detailed plans on trial design, participant recruitment, safety protocols, post-treatment aftercare, and strategy for FDA-approval.\n\nSenate Bill 2308 does not attempt to legalize ibogaine or ibogaine treatment, nor does it try to bypass existing federal regulations. It would retain current prohibitions on possession, use, manufacture, and sale of psychedelic compounds, as well as provide a framework consistent with the FDA drug-approval process, as ibogaine treatment administration will only apply if FDA approval is granted, requiring licensed physicians to supervise its administration in healthcare facilities.\n\nOver the past decade, the medical community has increasingly recognized the potential of psychedelic therapies for the treatment of mental health conditions and addiction. However, despite promising research, access to innovative psychedelic therapies is limited by the FDA\u2019s designation of psychedelics as Schedule I substances. Ibogaine appears to have a unique ability to rapidly reduce withdrawal and craving symptoms associated with opioid addiction, often after just a single dose.\n\nThe grant program under SB 3208 offers an opportunity to collect comprehensive safety and efficacy data on ibogaine for treating OUD, SUD, and other mental health disorders, while ensuring alignment with existing federal regulations and FDA drug approval standards.\n\nWhile not necessarily a major point of concern, we\u2019d like to note that Senate Bill 3208 contains slightly different language regarding funding sources than its companion bill, House Bill 3717. The House Bill allows for funding from both appropriated money and gifts, grants, or donations, while the Senate Bill only allows for funding from gifts, grants, or donations. The House language may provide additional flexibility for the funding of ibogaine studies, potentially allowing for the use of resources such as opioid settlement funds. This broader funding approach could enhance the program\u2019s impact and success.\n\nOverall, SB 3208 would allow Texas to administer grants to conduct potentially life-saving research into ibogaine, which has shown tremendous promise in the therapeutic treatment of OUD, with minimal risk to both public safety and public health.

Texas recently approved $50 million for trials of ibogaine\u2019s effectiveness as a treatment for opioid use disorder. (Getty Images)\n\nKentucky shot itself in the foot by passing up a chance to pioneer a promising opioid treatment \u2014 an opportunity that Texas recently seized.\n\nBut it\u2019s not too late for the General Assembly to make Kentucky part of an effort to study and legalize ibogaine.\n\nHere is the context: In the late 1990s, Kentucky became ground zero in an emerging opioid epidemic initially fueled by prescription drug fraud and doctor/pharmacy shopping, with much of it paid for by government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare as well as private insurance.\u00a0\n\nAs an early response in 1999, Kentucky created KASPER, a monitoring system designed to track controlled-substance prescriptions. KASPER is used by both health care providers and as an investigative tool for law enforcement to combat the fraud which had crept into the prescribing of pain-killing medications.\n\nEven with this useful tool, opioid consumption swelled, particularly preying on poorer counties and populations, as well as veterans returning from the new combat zones. Eastern and Southeastern Kentucky were particularly overwhelmed.\u00a0\n\nNew research and treatment options emerged, including medication-assisted treatments such as Suboxone, and began to be widely used. Drug rehabilitation facilities seemed to be everywhere, advertised on every type of media.\u00a0\n\nBut nothing seemed to be having an effect, and the epidemic continues to this day. The consequences have been disastrous for Kentucky \u2014 from overcrowded prisons and county detention centers to increased unemployment and disability rolls to the serious toll on the state budget and economy.\n\nIn a positive turn, state attorneys general banded together to file lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies like Purdue Pharma and chain stores with pharmacies like Kroger. This began under then Attorney General Jack Conway with major settlements under his successors Attorneys General Andy Beshear, Daniel Cameron and Russell Coleman.\u00a0\n\nWoodford County partnered with other Kentucky municipalities to join the wave of litigation. This soon led to hundreds of millions of dollars funneled into state, county and city coffers to be used to fight the epidemic.\n\nThe Woodford County Agency for Substance Abuse Policy (ASAP) Opioid Task Force was created to receive and administer the local share of funds by developing local programs.\n\n Bryan Hubbard announces plans to explore ibogaine as a treatment for opioid-use disorder during a May 31 event hosted by his then-boss, Attorney General Daniel Cameron. (Photo by Melissa Patrick for Kentucky Health News)\n\nHowever, the state\u2019s biggest government player is the Kentucky Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission, created by the legislature in 2021 and tasked with making grants from the state\u2019s portion of the $900 million in settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors, with half of the money going to the state and half going to local governments\n\nThe commission has nine voting and two non-voting members, and is housed in the attorney general\u2019s office.\u00a0\n\nCameron was the attorney general who oversaw the first commission and appointed Bryan Hubbard as its executive director.\u00a0\n\nHubbard developed a plan he described as a \u201cmoon shot\u201d focused on an emerging treatment protocol using the plant-based hallucinogenic drug ibogaine.\u00a0\n\nIbogaine was successfully being used in two physician-controlled clinics in Mexico and being studied by researchers at Stanford University and top European medical research institutions.\u00a0\n\nAfter months of investigation, consultations with experts as well as meetings with various veteran groups that were focusing on opioid addiction in combat vets, Hubbard met with Cameron and his deputies in the fall of 2023 to present his proposal.\n\nResearch and clinical experience demonstrated that administering ibogaine to someone who has addiction eliminates that person\u2019s mental and physical \u201cswitch\u201d for the drug and, significantly, eliminates the horrific withdrawal period, which is, more often than not, the formidable barrier to recovery.\n\nIbogaine alone does not ensure long-term recovery; the person with the addiction still needs the mental health and spiritual support of the recovery process post-withdrawal, but it turns a heretofore rare road to recovery into a wide door of success.\n\nFor a state as crippled as Kentucky is by the opioid epidemic, the ibogaine option presented real hope.\u00a0\n\nCameron was persuaded by Hubbard, and $45 million of the initial tranche of opioid settlement funds were dedicated. After months of public hearings across the state, presentations and testimonials from veterans\u2019 groups and science researchers, Hubbard\u2019s proposal was ready to be presented to and approved by the commission. Hubbard, and other supporters expected it to be passed given the makeup of the commission.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSuccess would mean funding research, analyzing and working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Congress, partnering with research universities \u2014 though the University of Kentucky, via its representative on the commission and lobbying the Beshear administration, fought the initiative \u2014 developing trials, and particularly valuable to the state\u2019s treasury, ensuring ownership of patents and other intellectual property.\u00a0\n\nAfter several meetings and scientific presentations, Hubbard gained the support of the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, the preeminent Kentucky health policy foundation, and its then-CEO Ben Chandler, a former state attorney general, who testified and lobbied in support of the ibogaine initiative. (Chandler also is publisher of The Woodford Sun.)\n\nHubbard spoke to Woodford County\u2019s ASAP opioid commission last year. Nancy Blackford, a board member who lost a son to opioid addiction, told me how impressed she was with Hubbard and the promise ibogaine held.\n\nA sure thing? No. There were legal hurdles yet to overcome given that ibogaine is illegal due to its hallucinogenic properties, as well as posing a serious cardiac clinical side effect that is sometimes seen during its use.\u00a0\n\nBut Kentucky was with open eyes and an investment of $45 million \u2014 a modest amount given the total size of the opioid settlements \u2014 ready to step forward.\n\nBut that did not happen. Instead, Kentucky shot itself in the foot.\n\nAt this point, we don\u2019t yet know all the actors and circumstances that led to the decision, but newly elected Attorney General Coleman fired Hubbard and pulled the plug on the ibogaine program. The proposal was rejected by the commission on Jan. 4, 2024, the first meeting with Coleman as attorney general and his appointee Chris Evans, a former chief operating officer for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, leading the commission.\u00a0\n\nIn one of his first major decisions as attorney general, Coleman opted for the safe, same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019.\u00a0\n\nBut the ibogaine initiative did not die. Hubbard created the American Ibogaine Initiative (AII) and partnered with former Texas Gov. and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.\n\nPerry became so convinced this was a miracle opportunity that he\u00a0 testified to the Kentucky commission and helped fundraise and support Hubbard\u2019s new endeavor.\u00a0\n\nThe two appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Jan. 2, 2025, for two hours explaining and discussing the promise of ibogaine as the new frontier for opioid addiction.\n\nIn June, the Texas legislature approved $50 million for ibogaine development trials based on the drug\u2019s \u201cextraordinary promise as a breakthrough treatment for substance use disorder, trauma-related conditions, and traumatic brain injury, according to a new release from the Texas legislature. Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill on June 11.\u00a0\n\nTexas will be partnering with two of its major medical schools and research facilities in Austin and Houston on the project.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nColorado, Ohio, West Virginia and other states are actively seeking to partner with Hubbard and Perry\u2019s AII to develop programs in their states. And U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. recently announced his agency is ramping up government-run clinical studies of hallucinogenic pharmaceuticals to address opioid addiction and other mental illnesses.\n\n\u201cIbogaine is the Manhattan Project of our time,\u201d Hubbard said after the Texas law was passed. \u201cWe have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the fabric of this country. And mighty Texas, in all its strength and independence, is the first state to stand up and lead a revolution in the treatment of trauma and addiction.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHubbard, who resides in Lexington but was raised in the Central Appalachian region of Virginia, told me a few weeks ago, \u201cWhat began in Kentucky will return to Kentucky. Not in the timeline or terms we would have wished, but it is my hope and fervent prayer it is coming.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAccording to Hubbard, the legislature could still become part of a coalition of states to accelerate ibogaine\u2019s pharmacological development and ultimate widespread availability by establishing, with an appropriation, drug trial sites in partnership with the drug companies already involved (what Texas is doing). He says Kentucky could still benefit from some intellectual property rights.\n\nThough Hubbard declined to go into details, the cleanest and best path appears to bypass Gov. Beshear and Attorney General Coleman to get the deal done in the legislature during the 2026 session, which is a long one and well suited to this type of issue.\n\nFor the rest of us, let\u2019s hope our political leaders don\u2019t shoot the other foot when the ibogaine boat sails back.\n\nThis column has been updated to correctly identify former Attorney General Jack Conway.

In honor of the Hacketts, MMHPI will establish The Hackett Center for Mental Health in Houston, a permanent operating program of MMHPI with an initial primary focus on Hurricane Harvey recovery.\n\n\u201cThis extraordinary gift will allow us to establish a lasting presence in Houston focused on translating policy into practice in partnership with the region\u2019s leading health systems,\u201d said Dr. Andy Keller, President and CEO of MMHPI. \u201cThe Hackett Center for Mental Health will be a catalyst for advancements by better aligning public and private sector policies to improve mental health care delivery \u2013 expanding brain health research, strengthening academic-public-private partnerships and improving the quality and availability of care in one of our nation\u2019s largest metropolitan areas.\u201d\n\nThe Hackett Center for Mental Health is based on the premise that health system transformation requires a continuous focus on local system collaboration and capacity enhancement, sustained by system-level policy reforms. The center will engage local and state leaders to improve the region\u2019s institutional capacity for mental health policy and program research and technical assistance to implement state-of-the-art best practices. The new center will maintain the Institute\u2019s progress at a state and regional level for children, veterans and adults in the criminal justice system, and will continue to place an emphasis on the necessary synergy between state policy and local system transformation needed to achieve better outcomes.\n\nGiven its focus as serving as a catalyst for improving mental health care across the region\u2019s health systems, The Hackett Center for Mental Health will locate in the Texas Medical Center and will be an active partner in the vision of collaboration and innovation at the heart of TMC3.\n\nThe Institute is also proud to announce that Susan Fordice will serve as executive director of The Hackett Center for Mental Health. She previously served as President and CEO of Mental Health America of Greater Houston, and brings decades of service to the community in many of the region\u2019s leading health and academic institutions, as well as an unparalleled knowledge of the mental health landscape in Houston and the region.\n\nMaureen Hackett said her family believes in the mission and the expertise of the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cOur family is dedicated to serving the interests that make up the heart of every strong community: faith, family, health and education. Mental health care is a cause so dear to my family, the community, this great state and the entire nation,\u201d said Maureen Hackett. \u201cThis gift is an investment in quality, research-driven work that will prove to be a systemic game-changer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hackett family has long held a vision of Houston as a home for world-renowned brain health research and innovation, as well as a model of effective access to mental health care,\u201d said Jim Hackett. \u201cThrough this gift, we can put policies into practice to help realize that dream.\u201d\n\nThree in four Texans have a friend or family member who has experienced a mental health issue, and an estimated 310,000 children and youth in Harris County have mental health needs each year.\n\n\u201cMental health, just like physical health, affects the lives of all Texans,\u201d said Tom Luce, board member and founding CEO of MMHPI. \u201cThe Hacketts\u2019 generous philanthropy and profound dedication to expanding access to mental health care will have a sustained, positive impact for generations of future Texans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hackett family has put Houston on the national stage in addressing how mental health services are delivered,\u201d said Lyndon Olson, MMHPI Board Chair. \u201cBehavioral health is one of the most significant medical, public policy, and perception challenges of our time, and this gift positions The Hackett Center to be a driving force in creating the path forward.\u201d\n\nThe Hacketts are passionate agents of change in the realm of behavioral and mental health. Maureen Hackett has served in local, state and national leadership roles in mental health for over 30 years. She is a founding board member of the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute and serves on the advisory boards of the Texas Medical Center, the Behavioral and Developmental Collaborative at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital and The Mental Health Channel. She is also a member of the Executive Committee of the MD Anderson Cancer Center Board of Visitors, a director of the American Psychiatric Association Foundation, and an Honorary Lifetime Board Member of Mental Health America of Greater Houston. She is past chair of The Menninger Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nJim Hackett is the former Executive Chairman of the Board and former CEO of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. He is currently a Partner in Riverstone Holdings and CEO of Silver Run II, an energy investment fund. He cares passionately about mental health parity and has testified before the U.S. Congress about the need for mental health coverage by employers. He previously led efforts to encourage other Houston business leaders to review their insurance coverage regarding mental health care.\n\nA major early focus of the center will be addressing the myriad of mental health needs left in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. \u201cHurricanes and other natural disasters can have long-term harmful effects on the mental health of children, youth and adults,\u201d said Dr. Keller. \u201cThe Hackett Center for Mental Health will work with existing agencies and organizations to more efficiently and effectively build capacity and provide care to heal the emotional wounds left by this storm.\u201d\n\nAbout MMHPI\n\nSince its public launch in 2014, MMHPI has helped Texas legislators, state officials, members of the judiciary, and local leaders identify systemic mental health needs and solutions, quickly becoming Texas\u2019s most trusted source for data-driven mental health policy. In three short years, the Institute has begun to make significant impact in multiple areas, helping Texas leaders expand the mental health workforce, improve access to care for veterans and their families, shift the focus of new investments toward early intervention, and address the mental health crisis in our jails and emergency rooms.\n\nConnect with us on Twitter @TXMind and on Facebook at TXMind.\n\n# # #\n\nAttachments:\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/98ab2efc-a2d6-4665-aee6-a526e4f86e87\n\nAttachments:\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/68242353-080c-4c2c-848b-89aada273fff\n\nAttachments:\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b8b48d2e-f617-4314-8762-b279e0c9a903", "source_domain": "www.globenewswire.com", "article_id": "9bf5e0ae-d89f-41d7-aefb-59437f4c3a3b", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Blau, Ph.D., will be its new Executive Director. For the past 15 years, Dr. Blau has served as Chief of the Child, Adolescent and Family Branch for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in Maryland. He will assume his new role in Houston beginning Sept. 13.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter 25 years in government on the federal and state level, it\u2019s been a dream for me to be able to take on a role such as this with a focus on putting policy into practice,\u201d Dr. Blau said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled with this opportunity to take my knowledge and skills and apply them to efforts in Houston, the greater Gulf Coast, and across Texas.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt SAMHSA, Dr. Blau provided national leadership for children\u2019s mental health, helping create systems of care across the country \u2013 including many projects in Texas \u2013 and launching an array of high-impact policy and practice transformation efforts that have changed the landscape of mental health for children. Prior to his work on the national level, Dr. Blau served as Connecticut\u2019s Director of Mental Health and as Bureau Chief for Quality Management at the state\u2019s Department of Children and Families (DCF). In addition, as Director of Clinical Services at the Child and Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut, Dr. Blau supervised outpatient, home-based, and school-based services.\n\n\n\nDr. Blau has extensive experience in public policy, developing evidence-based community programs, implementing health care reform initiatives, and focusing on critical issues such as trauma, school-based mental health, prevention and early intervention, health disparities, and poverty. He is perhaps best known for his leadership in expanding awareness and support for the values and principles reflected in the \u201csystem of care\u201d framework; namely, that services and supports should be organized into a coordinated network, that meaningful partnerships should be built with service users, and that services and systems should be evidence-based and culturally and linguistically competent. He has a wide range of experiences from direct clinical work, to supervising state-operated inpatient and residential facilities for children, to creating the \u201cNational Building Bridges Initiative (BBI),\u201d which is focused on improving outcomes for youth who receive residential interventions.\n\n\n\nDr. Blau\u2019s reputation as a collaborator who is skilled at bringing together service providers, researchers, and policy and decision-makers, as well as family members, youth, and community partners, connects directly with The Hackett Center for Mental Health\u2019s mission.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Hackett Center is proud to have someone of Dr. Blau\u2019s exceptional talent, experience, and reputation as our Executive Director,\u201d said THC Founder Maureen Hackett. \u201cHis nationally-recognized leadership and expertise will help advance our mission to change mental health care and put policy into practice in Houston, along the Texas Gulf Coast, and beyond.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Blau is an extraordinary, accomplished thought leader within the national mental health community, and has a wealth of experience that will prove invaluable as The Hackett Center continues its important work of helping improve mental health care along the Gulf Coast, particularly among children,\u201d said MMHPI President and CEO Andy Keller, Ph.D. \u201cWe are grateful to have someone of his caliber and reputation taking the reins at THC.\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. Blau succeeds Susan Fordice, who served as Executive Director through THC\u2019s first year of operation. Fordice now serves as a Senior Fellow for the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.\n\n\n\nA champion of youth and families, Dr. Blau helped craft the concept of \u201cfamily-driven care,\u201d ensuring families have a role in their treatment and in the improvement of services and systems. He is acknowledged as the \u201cfather\u201d of Youth MOVE (Youth Motivating Others through Voices of Experience), a national, youth-led mental health organization that now has more than 65 chapters across the United States. Youth MOVE has named one of its annual awards the \u201cDr. Gary Blau Award,\u201d which is given yearly to a mental health professional who has distinguished themself as a voice for youth.\n\n\n\nDr. Blau received his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at Auburn University and continues to write and publish nationally in the area of children\u2019s mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Hackett Center for Mental Health\n\nThrough the generosity of the Maureen and Jim Hackett Family, The Hackett Center for Mental Health was established in January 2018 as the inaugural regional center of the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. Leveraging the participation of exceptionally skilled researchers, community leaders, and health care providers, The Hackett Center\u2019s purpose is to transform systems and influence policy through unprecedented collaboration.\n\nAbout MMHPI\n\nSince its public launch in 2014, MMHPI has helped Texas legislators, government officials, members of the judiciary, and local leaders identify systemic mental health needs and solutions, quickly becoming Texas\u2019s most trusted source for data-driven mental health policy. MMHPI is helping Texas leaders address the mental health crisis in our jails and emergency rooms, improve access to care for veterans and their families, shift the focus of new investments toward early intervention, and expand the mental health workforce.\n\nAttachments", "source_domain": "www.globenewswire.com", "article_id": "66848a49-280c-4c64-98e5-571dc328d9af", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}
{"url": "https://www.dmagazine.com/healthcare-business/2023/03/how-meadows-is-diversifying-crisis-response-in-texas/", "title": "How Meadows Is Diversifying Crisis Response in Texas - D Magazine", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Advertisement\n\nMeadows Mental Health Policy Institute is helping other cities launch teams that can respond to mental health crises and divert individuals experiencing psychiatric episodes from jail. The Dallas-based mental health policy nonprofit is in the process of providing data and training to cities like Galveston to change the way municipalities think about responding to 911 calls.\n\nThe programs around the state are being modeled after a program started in Dallas. In 2018, Dallas launched a\u00a0pilot\u00a0of the Rapid Integrated Group Health Team, or RIGHT Care, which paired social workers with police during 911 calls that involved a mental health emergency. The team includes a police officer, a licensed clinical social worker, a paramedic, and off-site clinicians and responds to nonviolent mental health crises reported to 911.\n\nThe team is able to divert patients from the county jail by sending professionals with more experience and knowledge of resources for those with mental health issues. Prior to the launch of RIGHT Care, residents who needed care would often end up in the county jail, the county\u2019s largest mental health provider.\n\nMMHPI partnered with the Pew Charitable Trust to produce a\u00a0report\u00a0about the RIGHT Care team. It found that 40 percent of interactions resulted in a connection to services to provide healthcare or housing, 29 percent were resolved on the scene without any further assistance, 14 percent resulted in emergency detention, and 8 percent resulted in a person being taken to a hospital or psychiatric facility. Only 2 percent of the interactions resulted in arrests for new offenses.\n\nNow MMHPI is using its experience and data to help other areas of the state replicate the results. One of the more advanced projects is in Galveston, where a team of police, mental health providers, and paramedics are expected to launch this spring. MMHPI analyzed data from call logs and 911 records to see how past calls connected to a mental health crisis have been handled. The work helped Galveston determine when they would need the teams, how many people they would need to staff them, and which types of calls the team would handle and avoid.\n\nThe work has resulted in a team called Compassionate Open Access to Services and Treatment, which will work 12 hour shifts from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m, six days a week. It consists of two groups of six professionals. There will also be a short shift on Sunday.\n\nAs with RIGHT care, there will be a police officer present for the security of the scene, but the other members will be able to provide comprehensive health screenings, address comorbidities, and connect with resources around housing, substance abuse, or food insecurity. The interaction is more likely to result in a treatment option that doesn\u2019t involve being arrested and going to jail, Meadows believes.\n\n\u201cThe whole design of the program is to alleviate law enforcement from being the primary responders to people experiencing a mental health crisis,\u201d says Max Geron, the senior director of health and public safety at MMHPI. Geron is the former chief of police in Rockwall and was once a major with the Dallas Police Department.\n\nIn addition to responding to 911 calls, the teams will also have a proactive role. They will touch base with individuals who frequently use 911 as a mental health resource and see if they can head off issues before they happen. The teams will also follow up on calls that happened overnight or in the past to see if anything can be done.\n\nCOAST in Galveston is being funded in its pilot year by Pew\u00a0Charitable Trust, the George and Cynthia Mitchell Foundation, the Moody Foundation and other Galveston area philanthropic organizations. Another potential financial partner is a $21 million federal\u00a0grant\u00a0currently sought from the Department of Justice as part of Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s Bipartisan Safer Communities Act focused on crisis intervention.\n\nMeadows handled the data analysis on the front end in Galveston but will also help measure the program\u2019s impact. As in Dallas, they will look at how many residents were diverted from the jail, connected with resources, and resolved without arrest. If the program is successful and worth the investment, the city of Galveston will take on the onus for continuing its funding. After the team launches this month, MMHPI will be able to report back, Geron says.\n\nLooking ahead, MMHPI is working with Dallas Area Rapid Transit to build a multi-disciplinary response team for public transit. Geron says they are still in the data collection stage but will look to launch a pilot in the next few months. In addition, MMHPI is in talks with others around the country who are hoping to launch their own MDRTs. Though many of these efforts were born out of the cultural shift and attitude toward policing that resulted from the death of George Floyd, Geron says the measure is about using the best tools for the job.\n\n\u201cWe are actively working to improve how law enforcement and public safety in general respond to folks in crisis to alleviate and remove that traditional law enforcement response,\u201d Geron says. \u201cIt\u2019s not because law enforcement is bad, but because there are better ways of addressing those experiencing mental health crisis by introducing the clinician and the paramedic and focusing more on mental health than just the traditional responses.\u201d\n\nAuthor\nWill Maddox\nView Profile\nWill is the senior writer for D CEO magazine and the editor of D CEO Healthcare.

And that\u2019s how he likes it", "published_at": "2024-12-06T00:00:00", "full_text": "Denver comedian Josh Blue has been in the national spotlight for two decades. His breakthrough came in 2006 when he won \u201cLast Comic Standing.\u201d Since then, he\u2019s only sharpened his timing and delivery. But as he releases his fifth comedy special, \u201cFreak Accident,\u201d he says there is still a lot to learn.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about stand-up is I\u2019ll never figure it out completely. Every time I think I\u2019ve got something pinned down, something new in the world happens or my brain puts a new connection together,\u201d he told Colorado Matters.\n\nIn his new special, filmed at Comedy Works South in Greenwood Village, Colo., Blue invites audiences to laugh along with him at his disability (he has cerebral palsy), his divorce, child-rearing, and the absurdity of life.\n\nEditor's note: Blue\u2019s interview with Senior Host Ryan Warner below has been lightly edited.\n\nRyan Warner: Going into a special like this, do you think, \u201cWhat is the balance of jokes I'm going to make about my disability versus other stuff?\u201d\n\nJosh Blue: There's no map on that. I've never written anything down physically. It's just all kind of off the top of my head. So it's basically whatever happens in my life in that timeframe.\n\nWarner: If you don't write stuff down, does that mean you've lost jokes occasionally?\n\nBlue: Oh, I probably have three specials worth of lost jokes.\n\nWarner: Tell us about your right arm, because it's the brunt of many of your jokes in the show.\n\nBlue: It does its own thing. Having cerebral palsy, the arm is doing whatever it wants. Over the years, I've been able to control it a bit. Right now I'm sitting on it. That way it's not fidgeting with the dials and stuff. It's a very mischievous body part.\n\nWarner: In the special, you imagine that it has its own mind\u2013 that it orders things from mail-in catalogs or the internet.\n\nBlue: Yeah, and obviously, I take it over the top, but that's how it feels. Definitely my whole life, it's been like having a raccoon attached to my body.\n\nHart Van Denburg/CPR News Comedian Josh Blue stops by the CPR News studios, on Dec. 3, 2024.\n\nWarner: Were you always able to laugh at it, or did you come to that at some point?\n\nBlue: Yeah, as a kid in elementary school and junior high, there was definitely a learning curve\u2013 of how to not be sad about being disabled. But eventually, I realized that I had the gift of humor. Once I learned that, I was able to throw myself under the comedic bus. It just broke the ice completely. I was definitely the class clown and I was one of the only disabled kids in my school. And what I learned is they don't send the disabled kid to detention, so I got away with a lot of stuff, Ryan. A lot of stuff.\n\nWarner: Were you made fun of in school?\n\nBlue: There was a little bit of that, but I also was friends with everybody, so I could go from lunch table to lunch table. If anybody ever did mess with me, I would just tell somebody. Then they would regulate that for me \u2026 and also, the right arm will do some damage if you get too close.\n\nWarner: Disability, raising kids, divorce. You defuse a lot of life's heavier topics with humor. What in your life right now is comedy helping you cope with?\n\nBlue: If you watch my first special \u2018til now, you'll see the progression of my life. Everything in it is raw. My first special, I'm talking about being a dad for the first time, and now my kids are teenagers. So I'm into \u201chow do I deal with these teens?\u201d sort of thing. And again, humor is such an amazing cure-all. I'm able to laugh with my teens. Maybe we have some tough topics, but I'm able to deal with it at home with humor, but then also take snippets and cater it to the greater audience that also is suffering with teenagers.\n\nWarner: In a way, you're testing material with your kids, or at least it's sort of incubating there.\n\nBlue: Yeah. And I feel like maybe if they watch all my specials, they'll probably need some psychiatric help.\n\nWarner: During this special, when you tell a joke, maybe one that's a little off-color, and especially when you get a big laugh, you get a subtle grin on your face. It makes me think, \u201cJosh Blue is a big kid who delights in getting away with stuff he probably couldn't as much when he was little.\u201d Do you think that's true?\n\nBlue: I love doing it, man. When I get the crowd to laugh at something that maybe is out of their comfort zone, it makes me giggle. It makes me laugh. And I'm like, \"I got them. I got them.\" And it is contagious. It really is. When you see me perform in a special, it's fun. But until you see me live, I don't think people know how fun the energy is in the room because I'm playing off of what's happening in the moment. And that's where you can really feel my true joy and energy of being in the moment.\n\nArthur Silk Denver comedian Josh Blue taped his fifth special, \"Freak Accident,\" at Comedy Works South in Greenwood Village, Colo.\n\nWarner: Are there sacrifices for a comedian who lives in Colorado \u2013 versus the stand-up hot spots of New York, Chicago, LA?\n\nBlue: For me, winning Last Comic Standing in '06, I was living here and it just skyrocketed me onto the national scene, so I never had to go to LA or New York to get discovered. And then, I just became a touring comic. And I've been doing 200 shows a year since then. I don't drive. So LA is not great for a non-driver. What I did miss was getting to rub elbows with a bunch of other headlining comics. I miss out on going to the Comedy Store on a Monday when all the comics come back from tour\u2013 just this comic jamboree of who's who. So I missed out on maybe getting on people's podcasts just because they don't know me from the scene.\n\nWarner: Is that something you have to fight against?\n\nBlue: I would love to, but my kids are in school, so I don't really have that opportunity to go do that right now. Maybe later in my career, once they're off to college, I can go and do some more of that. But it's not like they don't know who I am. They just don't think of me right away. When a TV sitcom comes up and they're like, \"Oh, we need a character.\" I'm just not on that radar.\n\nWarner: Was this special a single taping or several nights edited together?\n\nBlue: It was two shows, one night. That was part of the reason it took so long to edit this. The woman in the front row had a big pink bow on the first show. And then in the same seat, the second show was a 300-pound man in flannel. So it's very obvious if you look for that.\n\nArthur Silk Denver comedian Josh Blue taped his fifth special, \"Freak Accident,\" at Comedy Works South in Greenwood Village, Colo.\n\nWarner: Before we go, have your timing and delivery changed since you've started?\n\nBlue: I feel like I've always had impeccable timing. Even as a kid, I could just zip something in with the teacher and the whole class would laugh. I've always had that gift, but I feel like it has definitely evolved and I've gotten more comfortable in the silence. I'll let something ride longer, the laughter go, and then when I do hit them, it's even harder. What's beautiful about stand-up is I'll never figure it out completely. Every time I think I\u2019ve got something pinned down, something new in the world happens or something in my brain puts a new connection together. There's no end to this.\n\nWarner: Silence is scary. So you\u2019ve had to get used to that.\n\nBlue: I have a bit where somebody will get up to go to the bathroom and I'll be like, \"Where are you going?\" And they'll go, \"To the bathroom.\" And I'll be like, \"You want me to wait?\" And then I will wait the entire time they're gone. And it gets a laugh without me saying anything. And I mean, minutes go by without me saying something\u2013 just a facial expression or body movement, I can get it. And when they come back, it's like a standing ovation. These people are so happy this person came back from the bathroom. It's really fun.\n\nJosh Blue performs December 19-21 at Comedy Works Downtown.", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org", "article_id": "0aceec91-bf80-4d8d-96c4-bd9b30a9af65", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Additionally, app users remained in treatment nearly 19% longer than those treated with medication alone.\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest that augmenting medication for opioid use disorder with app-based contingency management may provide clinical benefits for underserved patients,\u201d said Elise Marino, PhD, director of research operations at UT Health San Antonio\u2019s Be Well Institute on Substance Use and Related Disorders. \u201cExpanding the availability of app-based contingency management may contribute to decreasing the immense societal, economic and personal burden of opioid use.\u201d\n\nMarino is lead author of the study, titled, \u201cSmartphone App-Based Contingency Management and Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcomes,\u201d published in JAMA Network Open. The other authors also are with UT Health San Antonio\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Be Well Institute.\n\nA need to augment medication\n\nOpioid use disorder continues to be a national crisis, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality. Its annual societal cost in the United States hit $968.9 billion in 2018, the study notes.\n\nMedication for opioid use disorder, or MOUD \u2013 including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone \u2013 is recognized as the only evidence-based treatment for the condition. This first-line treatment has been shown to significantly decrease opioid-related morbidity and mortality, and with consistent cost-saving benefits.\n\nHowever, some patients still experience difficulties reducing opioid use and staying with their treatment, pointing to a need to augment MOUD. Many conditions benefit from dual treatment of medication and therapy. One therapy is contingency management, or CM, which provides financial incentives for accomplishing treatment goals.\n\nThis therapy traditionally has been delivered in clinics, with the goal of an opioid-negative finding from urine drug screens. While findings have been mixed, several reviews and studies have found that individuals treated with MOUD plus CM had better retention and fewer opioid-positive results from urine drug screens.\n\nA long-standing limitation, however, is that patients are required to attend multiple in-person appointments per week for the therapy. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many were unwilling to make in-person CM visits. Additional access barriers, such as transportation, distance from the clinic and arranging child care, have supported other options like telehealth and leveraging new technologies.\n\nThere\u2019s an app\n\nOne such technology is the WEconnect Health CM smartphone app. The app delivers evidence-based CM embedded in a recovery-oriented framework. In addition to providing substance-related behavioral targets, it permits patients to set daily goals that are personally meaningful, both substance use-related and otherwise, like attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, going for a walk or reading.\n\nThe app also includes a platform for tracking patients\u2019 progress and payment, and provides encouragement for completing their daily goals. Additionally, WEconnect offers 1-to-1 peer support and online meetings facilitated by certified peers. In contrast to traditional CM, the app permits patients to make decisions regarding their own goals for treatment and to explore recovery through peer support services available anywhere and accessible outside of normal clinic hours.\n\nFor the new research, the scientists set out to evaluate whether augmenting MOUD with app-based CM is associated with fewer days of opioid use at the end of treatment and greater retention than treatment with MOUD only.\n\nThe retrospective cohort study, which refers to research that follows a group of people over time, used data from Nov.1, 2020, to Nov. 30, 2023, collected from opioid treatment programs across Texas. The cohort included 600 individuals aged 18 years or older who were uninsured or underinsured and who chose to receive MOUD only or MOUD plus CM delivered by the WEconnect smartphone app.\n\nThose who chose to receive MOUD plus app-based CM reported a mean duration of 8.4 days of opioid use at the end of treatment compared with 12 days for those who chose to receive MOUD only. Retention analysis showed that patients who chose to receive MOUD plus app-based CM stayed with their treatment for a mean duration of 290.2 days, compared with 236.1 days for those choosing to receive MOUD only.\n\n\u201cThese results are promising, and they highlight the potential importance of a patient\u2019s decision to use app-based CM,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cDespite the challenges of engaging patients in other app-based interventions, adding recovery-oriented, app-based CM may be one way to enhance clinical care and meet the growing needs of historically underserved patients taking MOUD.\u201d\n\nUT Health San Antonio is a world-class research university, ranking at the top 5% among institutions globally for clinical medicine according to U.S. News & World Report.

She had some Narcan at home, just in case. But still, as a longtime resident of Abilene, she didn\u2019t think it was something HER community had to worry about, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until June the 12th of 2023 that I discovered fentanyl is right in my in my own house. And that was my son, Jerrin Hernandez\u2019s first overdose,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nLewis noticed Jerrin acting strangely the night before. That morning, when she went to wake him up, it was obvious something was wrong, \u201cHe was not breathing, and he was purple and his lips were purple, and he was making this awful gurgling sound\u2026 And so immediately I ran and got the Narcan and called 911.\u201d This is Lewis telling her story to the Abilene city council earlier this summer. She told the crowd how Jerrin survived but suffered from short-term memory loss. He overdosed again that August, and, finally, a third time in December 2023. \u201cI am one of the mothers who lost their child to fentanyl last year.\u201d\n\nKrystal Lewis was one of several people who came to this June city council meeting to talk about Abilene\u2019s fentanyl problem. They told city leaders they needed to be doing much more. Most attendees were not prepared for the testimonies they heard that morning. That might be because, if someone hasn\u2019t been personally affected by fentanyl, it seems like an epidemic that lives in the headlines, not their backyard. But Dr. John Russell, an emergency physician at Hendrix Health in Abilene, says the crisis is here. And it\u2019s growing, \u201cWe have seen an increase in the overall numbers of fentanyl-related, illnesses and deaths. the most likely outcome was somebody overdoses on fentanyl.\u201d\n\nCompared to other narcotics that land people in the ER, Russell says an overdose from fentanyl is far worse. \u201cIf somebody is using heroin, that\u2019s probably the closest thing. but with fentanyl, it just occurs so much more rapidly. People stop breathing from opioid overdoses just because they don\u2019t even care to breathe.\u201d It\u2019s become such an issue in Abilene, that just last month, some local organizations installed a Narcan vending machine near downtown.\n\nA few weeks after the city council meeting, I met with Krystal Lewis and her husband. Since Jerrin\u2019s death, they\u2019ve learned everything they can about the epidemic, and want to share that information, \u201c76% of overdoses 14 to 23 are fentanyl-related, and 70% of those are males. People who have experienced a non-fatal drug overdose are at a higher risk of a fatal overdose than those who have not.\u201d\n\nLewis says Jerrin\u2019s death devastated the family. But two months afterward, she suddenly felt called to DO something, \u201c I woke up on Saturday morning and this is placed on my heart and immediately just started making phone calls and, you know, we really didn\u2019t know what we were doing at all. And, you know, that\u2019s what the kind of beautiful thing God takes the unqualified, makes him qualified, and he makes a way. And I know that he is going to make Jerrin\u2019s Hope possible.\u201d\n\nJerrins Hope is what she\u2019s calling a regional youth treatment center she\u2019s trying to start in Abilene. She envisions a center that offers a comprehensive range of services, including mental health support and substance abuse counseling. And while the center\u2019s mission will be deeply rooted in faith, Lewis wants it to be a place that can help everyone. \u201cIt is a faith-based rehabilitation center, and there is I mean, we\u2019re not going to say no to any kid that wants to come. Does it matter if you\u2019re satanic or, you know what color the color of your skin is, or what your sexual preference is, none of that matters.\u201d\n\nWith her husband Huery, Lewis is hard at work making their dream of the center become a reality. She\u2019s also making sure the community doesn\u2019t forget about the harms of fentanyl. From sharing her testimony at public events to speaking with local law enforcement, Lewis is determined that Jerrin and others like him aren\u2019t forgotten. And it seems her efforts are paying off. Sargent Dale Watson agrees the crisis can\u2019t be ignored. He\u2019s with the Taylor County Sheriff\u2019s Office and has been in law enforcement for 27 years. He calls the rise in Abilene\u2019s fentanyl cases \u201cthe quickest growth of any drug I\u2019ve ever seen, I haven\u2019t seen anything like it in my career other than heroin and crack So my advice is for parents to make sure the kids know that if they take a pill, if it\u2019s going to be fentanyl, it\u2019s going to have to on it\u2019s not going to be a legitimate pill. It just doesn\u2019t even exist anymore, you know, on the street.\u201d\n\nWatson says the sheriff\u2019s office has focused on targeting narcotics traffickers, often starting with minor players and working up to larger networks. He says most fentanyl in Abilene can be traced back to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. As Watson sees the epidemic extend across demographics in Abilene, he welcomes things like Jerrin\u2019s Hope and says the community desperately needs more resources for rehabilitation and prevention, \u201cWe do not invest enough in that. And the number of people in this town and every city in America that has drug addicts, who would desire not to be, but there\u2019s not enough resources available. So anytime anyone says, hey, we\u2019re thinking of doing a rehabilitation center or thinking of funding this, I\u2019m always for it.\u201d\n\nWhile Jerrin\u2019s Hope is still in its early stages, Krystal Lewis hopes to have it off the ground in the next few years.", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org", "article_id": "07cdacf9-69c7-41dc-9294-5ce7cd7756ae", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

This belief is at the core of what Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains embodies and we are proud to stand with them in the best way we know how \u2013 brewing beer. \u201c\n\nThe cans of the kettle sour with raspberries and pineapple sold out quickly, but the beer is still available on tap at Cerebral. The sales from the beer\u2019s debut and donations at the launch party raised nearly $10,000 for Planned Parenthood\u2019s educational arm, far more than the brewery\u2019s past fundraisers for nonprofits.\n\nMolly Swank, the organization\u2019s director of community engagement, said it allowed them to reach a new audience. \u201cI think a lot of the people that came that night were just excited to see Cerebral standing with Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crowd at Cerebral Brewing in Denver for the Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains fundraiser in July. (Courtesy of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains)\n\nCerebral is planning another beer collaboration later this year to support another political cause. Buchan sees more upside than downside.\n\n\u201cI think you firm up your (loyalty) with the audience that shares that belief with you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to lose some people that we don\u2019t share an ideology with anyway, and that\u2019s the beauty of this industry and there are many other breweries they can support if they want to, and I\u2019m not going to take offense to it.\u201d\n\nMake more journalism like this possible with a Colorado Sun membership, starting at just $5 a month.\n\nNew Image Brewing in Arvada is another beermaker that lends its brand to social causes. Brandon Capps, the owner and brewer, said the \u201centire brand ethos is built off of mental health and wellness and promoting advocacy for it.\u201d\n\nThe brewery\u2019s name is a reference to Capps own journey. And New Image also sold cans under the name Better Together that included icons in support of LGBT causes. The proceeds from the beer support the Jefferson Center for Mental Health.\n\nBut what gave Capps and Buchan confidence to make the step into advocacy is a solid foundation and fan base. Capps said New Image needed to first prove itself as a brewery, and make its voice genuine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to be really organic and not super in your face,\u201d he said. \u201cCraft beer is a really touchy and sensitive market \u2026 they don\u2019t like being marketed and pandered to.\u201d\n\nStill, Capps thinks the craft beer audience is a market filled with people who want something more than just an alcoholic beverage.\n\n\u201cIf I was trying to sell beer to people who didn\u2019t want to talk about bigger issues, then I\u2019d probably be making a different type of beer,\u201d he said.", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com", "article_id": "ba55da66-d230-4620-ae30-2e3aaa711021", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}
{"url": "https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2016/danger-in-the-psych-ward/", "title": "Danger in the psych ward: Safety issues plague Universal Health Services-owned mental-health hospitals", "published_at": null, "full_text": "But the government compiled an unusual systemwide report on the company last summer at the request of congressmen from Illinois and Massachusetts, where a report by the Boston Globe and another by the Chicago Tribune revealed problems at Universal Health hospitals.\n\nFederal regulators usually focus only on incidents at individual hospitals, not across chains, so government data is fragmented and you can\u2019t easily compare Universal Health to its peers. And the company operates hospitals under a variety of names that can make it difficult for patients and watchdogs to evaluate its overall care.\n\nHowever federal data suggests that Universal Health has a higher-than-average rate of problems, according to a News analysis of government reports on hospitals that receive funding from Medicaid and Medicare. For example, government inspectors investigating complaints found serious problems at 8.4 percent of Universal\u2019s hospitals in 2014, the most recent full year for which data is available. Nationwide, that figure was 3 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful that over the course of treating approximately 2.5 million patients per year, irregular and unpredictable events occasionally occur,\u201d the company said in a statement in response to questions from The News.\n\nThe number of government safety citations simply reflects the chain\u2019s size, according to the company, which is based in a suburb of Philadelphia. When problems have been brought to its attention, the company says, it has come up with plans to fix them.\n\nUniversal Health, which is valued by Wall Street at over $11 billion, says its overall safety record is excellent. It cites rising patient-satisfaction scores and above-average results on hospital-accreditation evaluations.\n\n\u201cThe large number of investigations aimed at misconduct within this hospital system is appalling,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Peter Breggin, a New York-based psychiatrist who has consulted for the National Institute of Mental Health and the commission that accredits hospitals. \u201cIt is especially frightening that these deviations are occurring in the largest network of psychiatric hospitals in the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nInspectors found safety breaches at 13 of the company\u2019s 26 such facilities in Texas, the hospital company\u2019s largest market. Universal Health is the nation\u2019s biggest for-profit provider of mental-health services, including treatment for depression and addiction, and also owns some full-service hospitals.\n\nAcross Texas and around the country, government inspectors investigating patient complaints cited 44 of the company\u2019s hospitals for dangerously poor care or unsafe conditions between 2012 and mid-2015, according to data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s more than a quarter of the 154 company hospitals that The News identified as receiving taxpayer money to treat the poor and elderly.\n\nInspection data uncovered by The Dallas Morning News shows that serious safety problems have plagued dozens of mental-health hospitals owned by one giant chain: Universal Health Services Inc.\n\nIn San Angelo, hospital employees created infection risks by leaving an observation room covered in vomit and a kitchen black with grease and dead bugs.\n\nIIn Sherman, workers at a psychiatric ward dropped a suicidal patient off at a bus stop; a day later he was found dead after jumping from a Dallas bridge.\n\nThe News, which has exposed incidents at Timberlawn, the biggest psychiatric hospital in Dallas, obtained the report and underlying inspection material through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe numbers reveal that \u201cpatient complaints against the company aren\u2019t just isolated to one region, but extend across the country,\u2019\u2019 said David Wright, deputy regional administrator in Dallas for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The federal agency, which monitors hospitals that receive government payments, developed the report.\n\nIn all cases, the violations were so egregious that the hospitals faced expulsion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, which cover the poor, disabled and elderly. More than a third of the money Universal Health took in for treating psychiatric patients last year came from those programs, according to the company\u2019s financial filings.\n\nMost of the hospitals came up with acceptable plans to avoid expulsion, but company\u2019s Timberlawn Mental Health System in Dallas was booted last year, and is in the process of reapplying.\n\nBased on the same inspection reports compiled by the federal government, Texas is seeking to shut down Timberlawn and fine it a record $1 million, The News reported earlier this month. The hospital is appealing.\n\nSome of the most serious problems at Timberlawn and other Universal Health hospitals stem from improper care of suicidal patients who harmed themselves.\n\n\u201cOne cannot get lax with suicide precautions ever,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. James Knoll, director of forensic psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, N.Y., who reviewed inspection reports for several Universal Health hospitals. The nagging question, he added, is what causes \u201cthe breakdown between an industry leader\u2019s mission and its services in the trenches?\u2019\u2019\n\nThe union that represents about 1,800 Universal Health workers, out of more than 68,000, links the problems to inadequate staffing. It has pressed the company to create an independent committee of directors to oversee patient care.\n\nThe labor group also asked the company to invest more money in expanding its workforce, Ryan Pfeffer, research coordinator at Service Employees International Union, told The News.\n\nFederal regulations don\u2019t require specific staffing levels. The company declined to comment on the union\u2019s allegations, except to say that \u201cwe devote necessary resources to remediating any deficiencies\u2019\u2019 in care.\n\nExperts in psychiatric treatment say that hospital suicides can be prevented. Since 1979, the nonprofit Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has admitted at least 100,000 patients, said Dr. Geetha Jayaram, a psychiatrist there. Not one has committed suicide at the facility, she said.\n\nThe hospital has invested millions of dollars over many years to boost staffing so that it can screen and constantly monitor patients deemed at high risk for suicide, she said. Many hospitals, including Universal Health\u2019s, have a policy of checking on patients only every 15 minutes.\n\nUniversal Health is profitable, reporting earnings of more than $680 million last year on revenues of about $9 billion. Company executives told investors last month that their psychiatric facilities have a 27 percent operating margin, making them far more profitable than the company\u2019s regular hospitals.\n\nThe company is also at the center of a U.S. Supreme Court case where allegations of fraud, staffing problems and safety violations intersect.\n\n\"We're living with this giant hole in our lives every day. I don't really understand why industry changes have been so slow in coming.''\u200b - Anne Millar Williams, whose husband committed suicide a few days after he was released from a Universal Health hospital in Arkansas.\n\nA Massachusetts couple alleged in a lawsuit that one of the company\u2019s clinics fraudulently billed Medicaid for services that unlicensed and unsupervised therapists provided to their teenage daughter. Inspectors identified 23 unlicensed therapists at the clinic, in violation of health regulations. The family said such breaches made the clinic\u2019s billing claims bogus.\n\nUniversal Health contends regulations didn\u2019t specifically make compliance a condition of getting paid by Medicaid. Its position has been backed in court by the American Hospital Association and other industry lobbying groups. The high court will hear arguments April 19.\n\nIn addition, the company faces separate and expanding investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and the inspector general for the Health and Human Services Department into potential billing fraud and other matters. The inquiries involve the corporate headquarters, according to the company\u2019s financial filings, as well as about two dozen of its hospitals.\n\nAt least four of the hospitals cited for serious safety failures are also targets of billing inquiries, according to a review of company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNews about safety failures saddens Anne Millar Williams of Little Rock. Her late husband, John, was discharged from a Universal Health hospital there in 2006, less than 24 hours after he had told doctors he had planned to shoot himself. A few days later, he committed suicide.\n\nAfter members of the Millar family sued, Universal reached a confidential settlement with them. But a decade later, \u201cWe\u2019re living with this giant hole in our lives every day,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand why industry changes have been so slow in coming.\u2019\u2019\n\nFreelance reporter Daniel Lathrop contributed to this report.\n\nSUICIDE HOTLINE:\n\nCall 24/7: 1 800 273-8255\n\nwww.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\n\nUnsettling cases\n\nGovernment regulators have cited at least three Universal Health Services psychiatric facilities in Texas since 2012 for failing to safeguard suicidal patients who went on to harm or kill themselves. The company did not comment on the individual cases but said \u201cpatient safety is our highest priority,\u2019\u2019 adding that 11 company facilities are now serving as pilot sites for a new suicide-prevention program. Here are descriptions of the incidents from government reports:\n\nTexoma Medical Center in Sherman\n\nIn July 2014, the hospital\u2019s behavioral-health facility admitted a patient with \u201csuicidal ideation\u2019\u2019 after he had jumped through a glass window. He was later found unconscious on the floor of his patient room with a \u201clong elastic bandage around his neck\u2019\u2019 and blood in his mouth. He was resuscitated but suffered brain damage. Here's the report.\n\nTwo months later, another patient who had threatened to hang himself followed through, \u201cslinging a knotted sheet over the door to his room and tying it around his neck.\u2019\u2019 Nurses pushed their way inside the room, where his body was blocking the door, just in time to save him. Here's the report.\n\nIn January 2015, another patient\u2019s attempt proved fatal. The 33-year-old man checked into the hospital, confiding that he had suicidal thoughts and had come up with a plan to jump off a bridge. After 10 days at the facility, he was still under \u201csuicide precautions\u201d but the hospital discharged him. Less than 24 hours later, he was found dead underneath a bridge near the Trinity River. The Dallas County medical examiner ruled it suicide. Here's the report.\n\nAustin Oaks Hospital in Austin\n\nInspectors found that nurses violated the rights of a suicidal 15-year-old who had been raped by a relative. On Oct. 14, 2014, a male nurse, struggling to medicate her, \u201cgrabbed the patient\u2019s gown with his right hand and ripped the gown off, leaving the patient completely nude.\u2019\u2019 She was shut in isolation, naked, for about 23 minutes. Regulators and experts say solitary confinement can re-traumatize patient and should be used only as a last resort. Here's the report.\n\nTimberlawn Mental Health System in Dallas\n\nA patient who was left unobserved hanged herself from a closet doorknob with a torn sheet on Dec. 3, 2014, after repeated threats to kill herself that way. Timberlawn\u2019s policy was to check on patients only every 15 minutes, regulators said, but there was no evidence that occurred in this case. Hospital officials knew from an internal survey that such doorknobs posed a risk for hanging. Here's the report.\n\nTexas violations\n\nFederal health regulators flagged serious care violations at 13 Universal Health Services facilities in Texas\n\nNorthwest Texas Hospital, Amarillo\n\nTexoma Medical Center, Denison, and its affiliated TMC Behavioral Health Center, Sherman\n\nHickory Trails Hospital in DeSoto\n\nAustin Lakes Hospital, Austin\n\nAustin Oaks Hospital, Austin\n\nTimberlawn Mental Health System, Dallas\n\nKingwood Pines Hospital, Kingwood\n\nCypress Creek Hospital, Houston\n\nEl Paso Behavioral Health System, El Paso\n\nMillwood Hospital, Arlington\n\nWest Oaks Hospital, Houston\n\nGlen Oaks Hospital, Greenville\n\nRiver Crest Hospital, San Angelo", "source_domain": "interactives.dallasnews.com", "article_id": "de7daaaa-1203-4f1d-bbf6-11d3beb6a86c", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

France, PhD, to lead methocinnamox drug development program\n\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) was awarded a $12 million cooperative agreement (U01) from the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute on Drug Abuse to further develop methocinnamox (MCAM) as a treatment for opioid use disorder. MCAM is a mu opioid receptor antagonist with a long duration of action that blocks the effects of opioids like fentanyl, heroin and oxycodone.\n\nCharles P. France, PhD, professor of pharmacology and psychiatry, Robert A. Welch Distinguished University Chair with the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine, is a leading expert on MCAM and is heading this drug development program.\n\nThis award will support the manufacture of MCAM for clinical trials, submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potentially a Phase 1 clinical trial.\n\nFrance has studied MCAM for the past seven years at UT Health San Antonio. He said the goals in the next phase of development are ambitious but achievable.\n\nHis laboratory will oversee the project and conduct additional basic research while separate companies will manufacture MCAM and manage clinical trials.\n\n\u201cMaking a compound in gram or milligram quantities is one thing, but to scale it up brings in a whole different set of challenges,\u201d France said. Over the past several years the synthesis of MCAM was significantly improved and scaled up to kilogram quantities.\n\nFrance said they expect to have the required MCAM material manufactured near the end of 2024 and then have the IND application submitted in early 2025. A clinical trial could possibly begin 30 days after submission of the IND application.\n\n\u201cWe are very optimistic about having a good IND package and moving forward with clinical trials,\u201d France said.

But using it to help doctors and researchers learn more about diseases and improve healthcare is anything but novel. Every year on May 20, the Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP) celebrates Clinical Trials Day to recognize the day James Lind, a ship\u2019s surgeon in the British Royal Navy, started what is often considered the first randomized clinical trial in 1774 to study effects of different treatments for scurvy. Over the past 250 years, clinical trials have evolved into standardized procedures used to look at new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease.\n\nAcross HCA Healthcare, clinical research has brought forth new medications, new ways of doing surgery, new medical devices, new ways to use existing treatments and new ways to improve the quality of life for our patients with acute or chronic illnesses. Our research teams strive to advance medical knowledge and foster innovation through partnerships with top academic institutions (including a long-standing research collaboration with Harvard) and government health agencies like AHRQ, CDC and NIH. Large-scale trials employing practice-based research aim to advance clinical knowledge faster, and their real-world nature allows for results to be more broadly applicable to, and more rapidly incorporated into, real-world practice.\n\n\u201cResearch is simply the way we understand the world around us. It\u2019s important to medicine and therefore, it\u2019s important to HCA Healthcare. Whether it\u2019s studying a new order set, a new way to staff our units, a new drug, device or even existing therapies \u2013 research is vitally important to healthcare and to American medicine.\u201d DR. MICHAEL CUFFE, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER\n\nOur research projects involving antimicrobial stewardship, maternal health and COVID care have informed and improved patient care worldwide.\n\nREDUCE MRSA \u2013 Among nearly 75,000 patients across 43 HCA Healthcare hospitals, we found that using antimicrobial soap and ointment to decolonize all ICU patients reduced bloodstream infections by 44% and MRSA by 37%. The CDC has since adopted this practice.\n\nABATE Infection Trial \u2013 At 53 HCA Healthcare hospitals with 330,000 patients in 194 non-ICU units, we found an infection control technique achieved a 31% reduction in bloodstream infections and nearly a 40% reduction in antibiotic-resistant bacteria among non-ICU patients with central line catheters and lumbar drains.\n\n39 Weeks \u2013 We developed evidence-based perinatal protocols through our longstanding partnership with March of Dimes, such as prohibiting elective delivery prior to 39 weeks to help babies have a healthy start to life, finding lower risk for elective deliveries at term, informing the development of a national \u201cHard Stop\u201d policy to prevent elective deliveries prior to 39 weeks.\n\nCHARGE \u2013 We formed a consortium of prominent public and private research institutions to use HCA Healthcare\u2019s vast data on COVID-19 hospital care to improve patient outcomes and public knowledge.\n\nIn addition to these areas of focus, we invest in research related to trauma and burn care, nursing practice improvements, graduate medical education and much more. In recognition of Clinical Trials Day, we are shining a spotlight on the HCA Healthcare Research Institute, which has helped to improve care and quality outcomes for patients across the country.\n\nIn honor of Clinical Trials Day, HCA Healthcare colleagues celebrate the dedication of clinical research professionals to improving the health and well-being of our patients and advancing medical knowledge for generations to come.

In 1993, it all started with a goal to make cancer clinical trials accessible to the community without the support of an academic institution. The team established the first Phase 1 program in a community setting in 1997 and went on to become one of the largest programs of its kind in the world. Formally established as SCRI in 2004, it brought together community-based physicians, researchers and clinicians that conducted more than 600 first-in-human trials and became a clinical trial leader in the majority of approved cancer therapies in the last decade.\n\nIn June 2022, HCA Healthcare and McKesson announced plans to form a joint venture to expand clinical research services to improve cancer treatment options for patients. The joint venture combines the resources and expertise of McKesson\u2019s US Oncology Research (USOR) and SCRI. Together, USOR and SCRI will create a fully integrated oncology research organization aimed at expanding clinical research, accelerating drug development and increasing availability and access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and patients, including those in underserved communities.\n\nToday, the HCA Healthcare Research Institute is the multispecialty clinical research arm of our organization focused on advancing therapies for patients through our affiliated network of providers and care sites. Colleagues and clinicians across HCA Healthcare work to leverage our size and scale to support clinical research needs and collaborate with industry partners to advance medicine.\n\nThe HCA Healthcare Research Institute has conducted more than 500 industry-sponsored trials and enabled service and business lines to conduct high-quality clinical research across our sites of care, including interventional (device, pharma), non-therapeutic (early detection, screenings) and records-based (outcomes, real-world data).\n\nThe areas that the HCA Healthcare Research Institute supports at 36 research sites include:\n\nCardiac and vascular\n\nNeuroscience\n\nRobotics\n\nOrthopedics and spine\n\nWomen\u2019s and children\u2019s\n\nInfectious disease\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nComplex gastrointestinal\n\nOncology\n\nPulmonary and thoracic\n\nBurn\n\nBehavioral Health\n\nThe HCA Healthcare Research Institute also offers multispecialty centralized and site support services for our facilities and large-scale clinical study support.

Although the opioid crisis and the increasing prevalence of comorbidities have been described as epidemics, they are currently being addressed as separate public health issues. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring residents are provided with interprofessional care to reduce the burden of comorbidities, which can negatively impact their OUD recovery. Their RC should be routinely assessed and enhanced to support their recovery and improve HRQOL.\n\nResults: Most participants were 35 years/older (50.7%), male (58.9%), non-Hispanic White (68.4%), heterosexual (82.8%), and reported HRQOL problems, mainly anxiety/depression (78.4%) and pain/discomfort (55.7%). Participants who were 35 years/older [mean (SD) = 42.6 (7.3)] were more likely to report mobility and pain/discomfort problems than younger participants. Female participants were more likely to report pain/discomfort problems than male participants. Sexual minorities were more likely to report anxiety/depression problems than heterosexual participants. Married participants and those in committed relationships were more likely to report problems conducting self-care than single/never-married participants. Comorbid conditions were associated with mobility, pain/discomfort, and usual activities problems. Most participants reported high social (65.4%), personal (69.0%), and total (65.6%) RC. Low personal RC was associated with mobility (aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.24\u20130.76), self-care (aOR = 0.13, CI = 0.04\u20130.41), usual activities (aOR = 0.25, CI = 0.11\u20130.57), pain/discomfort (aOR = 0.37, CI = 0.20\u20130.68), and anxiety/depression (aOR = 0.33, CI = 0.15\u20130.73) problems. Low total RC was associated with problems conducting self-care (aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.07\u20130.60), usual activities (aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.22\u20130.83), pain/discomfort problems (aOR = 0.55, CI = 0.34\u20130.90), and anxiety/depression (aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.10\u20130.41) problems. Social RC was not associated with HRQOL.\n\nMethods: Project HOMES is an ongoing longitudinal study implemented in 14 recovery homes in Texas. This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from 358 participants\u2019 on HRQOL (five EQ-5D-5L dimensions\u2014mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and RC (Assessment of Recovery Capital scores) collected from April 2021 to June 2023. Statistical analyses were conducted using T-, Chi-squared, and Fisher\u2019s exact tests.\n\nBackground: Recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) includes improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and is supported by recovery capital (RC). Little is known about RC and HRQOL among recovery residents taking medication for OUD. We described HRQOL and RC and identified predictors of HRQOL.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nSubstance use disorders (SUDs), including opioid use disorder (OUD), negatively impact the quality of life (QOL), physical, mental, and emotional states, and social interactions of individuals who use substances (1). The opioid epidemic in the United States (US) is worsening, with over 9 million individuals misusing opioids and 5.6 million individuals having an OUD in 2021 (2). Over 91,000 drug overdose deaths were reported in 2020, an increase of 31% from 2019, and nearly 75% of all overdose deaths were attributed to opioids (3). Opioid and stimulant use disorders and drug overdoses in the US were responsible for 15.03 million disability-adjusted life years between March 2020 and February 2022 (4).\n\nThere is an increasing interest in QOL for decision-making, especially for economic evaluations, and as an essential outcome in clinical care and SUD recovery (1, 5, 6), particularly as perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a stronger predictor of mortality and morbidity than objective assessments of health (7, 8). Individuals with current or past OUD have significant reductions in HRQOL (9). Individuals with SUDs seeking treatment have persistently lower HRQOL than those without SUDs (1). Positive changes in HRQOL among individuals with OUD are associated with recovery outcomes, including improvements in stable housing and decreases in illicit drug use (10).\n\nRisk factors for OUD and opioid overdose deaths involving prescription and non-medical opioid use include mental and physical comorbidities and a history of SUD (11, 12). The prevalence of comorbid mental disorders is higher in adults with OUD compared to the general population (12, 13), with depression and anxiety being the most prevalent and associated with poorer HRQOL (14\u201317). Similarly, asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease related to opioid-related hospitalization, followed by obesity, liver disease, arthritis, cancer, and stroke (18). Patients with these chronic diseases often experience chronic pain (18) and significant reductions in their HRQOL (19\u201323). About 20.4% of U.S adults were living with chronic pain in 2016 (24), with researchers finding that individuals who reported chronic pain have problems conducting daily activities, mobility restrictions, worse health status, disability, and increased mortality risk (25\u201328).\n\nIndividuals who engage in the non-medical use of opioids frequently engage in polysubstance use, complicating the diagnosis and treatment of SUDs and accounting for most opioid-related overdose deaths (29). Most individuals engaging in polysubstance use have lower HRQOL (30) and develop comorbid SUDs (12). For instance, among individuals with an opioid (heroin) use disorder, about a quarter have an alcohol use disorder, more than 20% have a cocaine use disorder, and 12.3% have a marijuana use disorder (12). Other predictors of HRQOL among individuals with SUDs include sociodemographic characteristics, e.g., younger age, male gender, Caucasian race, marital status, employment, and higher educational qualifications, which positively correlate with higher HRQOL dimensions (1, 31\u201335).\n\nRecovery from OUD is a multidimensional concept that includes improvements in mental and physical health and overall functioning following abstinence (36). Many individuals with OUD have poorer HRQOL than non-users (9, 37). Most literature on HRQOL emphasizes the impact of chronic diseases on an individual\u2019s health and well-being rather than identifying predictors of HRQoL and resources that could support recovery from OUD and improve HRQoL (37, 38). Such research could help health planners, policymakers, and recovery resident operators plan and implement more effective recovery programs for OUD. This is critical as recovery from OUD is supported by medication for OUD (MOUD) and an individual\u2019s ability to use resources for abstinence initiation and maintenance (39). However, despite the effectiveness of MOUD in treating OUD, decreasing illicit substance use, and improving retention in care, uptake remains low (40).\n\nRecovery capital (RC) describes the entirety of resources individuals can use to support their recovery initiation and maintenance (39). RC comprises five resources: social, personal, physical, community, and cultural (41). However, social and personal RC may be stronger predictors of long-term recovery, with high social RC regulating the impact of low personal RC (42). Social RC is the benefits obtained from social networks and relationships that support recovery, including social support and social expectancies (41, 42). Personal RC is defined as individual characteristics, including self-efficacy, education/vocational skills, and mental and physical health (41, 42). Social and personal RC can be continually amassed or depleted over time as an individual\u2019s opioid use or recovery impacts their personal and social functioning (43). Understanding RC in research and practice is critical, particularly as the more RC an individual possesses, the higher their perceived QOL may be.\n\nThe World Health Organization QOL (WHOQOL) dimensions are associated with social and personal RC among emerging adults in substance use treatment (43) and total RC in treatment and recovery samples (6). RC improves QOL by 22% among individuals with an SUD (44). High social RC is associated with greater QOL and enhanced health outcomes (43, 45). Personal RC, such as abstinence self-efficacy, is associated with greater QOL (46). Although research on RC and HRQOL among individuals with SUDs is growing, more attention needs to be paid to RC and HRQOL among individuals with OUD living in recovery homes. This study aimed to describe RC and HRQOL across five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and identify predictors of the health dimensions among a sample of recovery residents taking MOUD. Specifically, we aimed to answer two research questions: (1) do participants differ in their RC and HRQOL levels when entering the recovery homes for OUD recovery support? (2) what are the predictors of HRQOL?\n\n2 Methods\n\n2.1 Design\n\nProject HOMES (Housing for Opioid Medication-Assisted Recovery Expanded Services) is an ongoing longitudinal study of 14 level II (monitored homes, staffed with a paid house manager) and III (supervised homes, staffed with a paid house manager, Director/Administrator, and certified peer support) recovery homes (47) for persons in recovery for OUD and residing in five Texas cities. Eligibility includes a primary diagnosis of OUD, taking MOUD or willing to take before move-in, 18+ years, English or Spanish speaking, able and willing to consent, and agree to sign the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant releases. Trained data collectors obtained written informed consent. Data analyzed were collected from April 2021 through June 2023. Ethical approval was granted by the institutional review board of the authors\u2019 home institution. Participants received a $25 gift card for their time.\n\n2.2 Measures\n\n2.2.1 Sociodemographic characteristics\n\nParticipants were asked about their age, race/ethnicity, sex at birth, sexual orientation, education, employment, and marital status (48). To ensure adequate statistical power in the regression models, dichotomous variables for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White and racial/ethnic minorities) and employment (employed and unemployed) were created.\n\n2.2.2 HRQOL dimensions\n\nHealth-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was measured using the EQ-5D-5L instrument, which consists of a descriptive system that assesses participants\u2019 self-rated health state in five dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression (49). Participants indicate their functioning level in a given dimension. Each dimension has five response levels of severity - no problem (1), slight problem (2), moderate problem (3), severe problem (4), and extreme problem (5) (see Table 1). The EQ-5D-5L responses were dichotomized as no problems and any problems (slight, moderate, severe, and extreme) to change the health states into frequencies of reported problems (49). Responses were also combined to generate health state profiles ranging from full health (11111) to worst health (55555). Each value for a health state was linked to a value set, i.e., index values (weights) for the US. The HRQOL index values range from \u22120.281 to 1, with negative values representing health states worse than death, 0 representing a health state equivalent to death, and 1 representing full health (49). Sample \u03b1 = 1.000.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTable 1. Self-reported 5Q-5D-5L problems by recovery capital.\n\n2.2.3 Polydrug use\n\nParticipants were asked about their illicit drug use or misuse in the past 90 days (48). The most frequently reported drugs used were street opioids (55.0%), followed by amphetamines (45.3%), methamphetamines (42.2%), benzodiazepines (38.8%), marijuana (37.5%), prescription opioids (26.0%), and cocaine (24.3%) (Supplementary Table S1). Participants were categorized as engaging in polydrug use based on the number of reported drugs used in the past 90 days.\n\n2.2.4 Hazardous drinking\n\nHazardous drinking was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (50). The AUDIT measures the frequency of drinking, typical quantity, frequency of heavy drinking, impaired control over drinking, increased salience over drinking, morning drinking, guilt after drinking, blackouts, alcohol-related injuries, and others\u2019 concerns about drinking in the past year. Participants with scores of 8 or above were categorized as having a high risk for hazardous drinking (sample \u03b1 = 0.879).\n\n2.2.5 Comorbid diagnoses\n\nParticipants were asked about 36 comorbid diseases, including depression, anxiety, cancer, arthritis, stroke, and diabetes. Participants were categorized as having comorbid diagnoses or not based on the number of reported comorbid diagnoses.\n\n2.2.6 Recovery capital\n\nThe Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) is a 50-item, dichotomous (0 = disagree, 1 = agree) scale used to assess participants\u2019 RC across two domains (6). Each domain has five dimensions. The social RC domain includes substance use and sobriety, citizenship and community involvement, social support, meaningful activities, and housing and safety. The personal RC domain has global psychological and physical health, risk-taking, coping and life functioning, and recovery experience. Participants were asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with each statement. The sum scores were calculated to create scores for social and personal ARC ranging from 0 to 25 and a total ARC score ranging from 0 to 50. Using cutoff points described in Obekpa et al. (51), ARC scores were dichotomized as low or high social, personal, and total RC (sample \u03b1: total = 0.852, social = 0.713, and personal = 0.768).\n\n2.3 Statistical analysis\n\nStudy variables were summarized using descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation (SD), frequencies, and percentages). EQ-5D-5L dimensions were compared by participant\u2019s characteristics and ARC scores using T-, Chi-square, or Fisher\u2019s exact tests. Variables significant at p < 0.1 were entered into multivariable logistic regression models to explore their relationships with each EQ-5D-5L dimension. Results of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were computed using Stata/MP 16 (52).\n\n3 Results\n\nThe mean age in our sample was 36.0 (SD = 8.9). Most participants were 35 years or older (50.7%; mean age = 42.6, SD = 7.3), non-Hispanic White (68.4%), heterosexual (82.8%), male (58.9%), single or never married (62.1%), unemployed (66.0%; 5.4% were unemployed, disabled), attended some college or had a college degree (50.1%), and engaged in polydrug use in the past 30 days (75.5%). Only 8.7% had a high risk for hazardous drinking. The mean scores for social, personal, and total RC were 21.36 (SD = 3.50), 21.39 (SD = 3.60), and 42.75 (SD = 6.63), respectively (Table 2). The mean score for the mobility dimension was 1.28 (SD = 0.67), self-care 1.08 (SD = 0.37), usual activities 2.01 (SD = 1.15), pain/discomfort 2.01 (SD = 1.15), and anxiety/depression 2.46 (SD = 1.16).\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics of EQ-5D-5L scores and ARC scores.\n\nTable 1 describes the five levels of self-reported 5Q-5D-5L problems by RC. Most participants with high social RC reported no problems in the mobility (84.0%), self-care (95.7%), usual activities (89.2%), and pain/discomfort (50.0%) dimensions, while 31.0% reported feeling slightly anxious/depressed, and 30.6% reported no anxiety/depression. Most participants with high personal RC reported no problems in the mobility (86.9%), self-care (98.0%), usual activities (91.8%), and pain/discomfort (53.9%) dimensions, while 32.6% reported feeling slightly anxious/depressed and 31.0% reported no anxiety/depression. Most participants with high total RC reported no mobility (85.5%), self-care (97.0%), usual activities (90.6%), and pain/discomfort (53.0%) problems. 32.5% reported feeling anxious/depressed, and 32.5% reported feeling slightly anxious/depressed.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the most frequently reported EQ-5D-5L health states and their index values by total ARC scores. Participants self-assigned 83 EQ-5D-5L health states out of a possible 3,125 health states. The most frequent 15 states (11111, 11112, 11113, 11122, 11133, 11123, 11121, 11132, 11124, 21132, 11114, 11131, 11134, 11143, and 11135) accounted for 74.1% of participants. Only 58 participants (16.3%) self-assigned health state 11111, i.e., full health, meaning no problem on any HRQOL dimension. Our sample\u2019s overall mean EQ-5D-5L index was 0.79 (SD = 0.16). Table 4 summarizes univariate and bivariate associations between participants\u2019 sociodemographic characteristics, substance use, comorbidities, RC, and EQ-5D-5L dimensions. Overall, the highest proportion of participants reporting any problem was in the anxiety/depression dimension (78.4%), followed by pain/discomfort (55.7%), mobility (19.3%), usual activities (15.5%), and self-care (6.8%). Most participants had high social (65.4%), personal (69.0%), and total (65.6%) RC.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nTable 3.

Participant\u2019s characteristics and ARC scores by EQ-5D-5L health dimensions (n = 358).\n\n3.1 Mobility problems\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were age, race/ethnicity, employment, marital status, comorbid diagnoses, MOUD duration, and personal and total RC. Most participants with mobility problems had high total RC (51.6%), while half had high personal RC. Multivariable logistic regression analyses of EQ-5D-5L dimension by participant factors are summarized in Table 5. Age 35+ years (Model 1: aOR = 2.11, CI = 1.13\u20133.95; Model 2: aOR = 2.07, CI = 1.141\u20133.85), comorbid diagnoses (Model 1: aOR = 2.23, CI = 1.04\u20134.78, Model 2: aOR = 2.20, CI = 1.04\u20134.69), and low personal RC (Model 1: aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.24\u20130.76) were associated with mobility problems. There were no significant associations between mobility problems and social and total RC.\n\nTABLE 5\n\nTable 5. Covariate adjusted multivariable logistic regression to predict any problems in each EQ-5D-5L health state by ARC scores and participants\u2019 characteristics.\n\n3.2 Self-care problems\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were employment, marital status, and personal and total RC. Most participants who reported problems conducting self-care had low personal (73.7%) and total (68.4%) RC. In Table 5, marital status- married/common-law marriage/committed relationship (Model 3: aOR = 4.16, CI = 1.14\u201315.19; Model 4: aOR = 4.57, CI = 1.27\u201316.41), low personal RC (Model 3: aOR = 0.13, CI = 0.04\u20130.41), and total RC (Model 4: aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.07\u20130.60) were associated with problems conducting self-care. There was no significant association between social RC and self-care problems.\n\n3.3 Usual activities problems\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were age, employment, marital status, hazardous drinking, polydrug use, comorbid diagnoses, MOUD duration, and social, personal, and total RC. In Table 5, most participants who reported problems conducting usual activities had high social RC (67.4%) and low personal (58.3%) and total (56.3%) RC. Comorbid diagnosis (Model 5: aOR = 2.61, CI = 1.02\u20136.66, Model 6: aOR = 2.54, CI = 1.01\u20136.40) and low personal (Model 5: aOR = 0.25, CI = 0.11\u20130.57) and total (Model 6: aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.22\u20130.83) RC were associated with problems conducting usual activities. There was no significant association between social RC and the usual activities dimension.\n\n3.4 Pain/discomfort dimension\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were age, sex at birth, employment, hazardous drinking, polydrug use, comorbid diagnoses, and social, personal, and total RC. Most participants who reported pain/discomfort problems had high social (61.4%), personal (59.8%), and total (57.7%) RC. In Table 5, age 35 + years (Model 7: aOR = 1.58, CI = 1.00\u20132.51), female sex (Model 7: aOR = 1.77, CI = 1.09\u20132.88; Model 8: aOR = 1.79, CI = 1.11\u20132.90), comorbid diagnoses (Model 7: aOR = 2.33, CI = 1.39\u20133.91, Model 8: aOR = 2.26, CI = 1.36\u20133.77), and low personal (Model 7: aOR = 0.37, CI = 0.20\u20130.68) and total (Model 8: aOR = 0.55, CI = 0.34\u20130.90) were associated with pain/discomfort problems. There were no significant associations between social RC and pain/discomfort problems.\n\n3.5 Anxiety/depression dimension\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were sexual orientation, employment, hazardous drinking, polydrug use, and social, personal, and total RC. Most participants who reported anxiety/depression problems had high social (59.9%), personal (62.8%), and total (58.4%) RC. In Table 5, sexual minority orientation (Model 9: aOR = 2.72, CI = 1.19\u20136.22; Model 10: aOR = 2.49, CI = 1.09\u20135.70) and low personal (Model 9: aOR = 0.33, CI = 0.15\u20130.73) and total (Model 10: aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.10\u20130.41) RC were associated with anxiety/depression problems. There were no significant associations between social RC and anxiety/depression problems. Hazardous drinking was excluded from the regression models due to the small cell size.\n\n4 Discussion\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between RC and EQ-5D-5L HRQOL, described as frequencies of reported problems across five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), among recovery residents taking MOUD in the United States. Our findings add new evidence to the growing literature on RC and HRQOL among recovery residents with OUD. We identified the health dimensions most affected by OUD and comorbid health conditions, summarized the frequency of problems across each dimension, measured the levels of RC and HRQOL problems, examined their associations, and identified strong predictors of poor HRQOL. Our findings can improve our understanding of RC and HRQOL among recovery residents with OUD. With improved understanding, health planners, recovery home administrators/operators, and policy-makers can strengthen recovery residence-based care systems through resource allocation and prioritization.\n\nMost of our study participants self-assigned low HRQOL. Participants 35 years and older were more likely to report mobility and pain/discomfort problems than younger participants. Our findings are concerning because this is a younger sample self-reporting mobility and pain/discomfort problems, contrasting with research that demonstrated mobility problems and chronic pain are common among older adults with OUD (53, 54) and the general population (55, 56), and predictors of SUDs in older adults (57).\n\nOur findings indicate that recovery residents with OUD who report mobility and pain/discomfort problems require special attention for several reasons. First, the most frequently reported comorbidities in our sample were mental health, respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal conditions (Supplementary Table S1), and having either of these comorbidities is associated with mobility problems, pain/discomfort problems, and problems conducting usual activities. Second, individuals with chronic pain, respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal/degenerative diseases are frequently prescribed opioids (55, 58\u201360), often misuse prescription opioids (61\u201363), and self-medicate with illicit drugs, resulting in SUDs, including OUD (64, 65). Furthermore, mobility problems are associated with mental illness, including anxiety and depression, increased risk of falls, and cardiovascular and respiratory conditions (66). Finally, the economic cost of pain ($560 billion to $635 billion), OUD ($471 billion), fatal opioid overdose ($550 billion), injury due to fatal ($754 million) and non-fatal ($50 billion) falls, and mental and chronic health conditions, including musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases (an estimated 90% of the United States $4.1 trillion yearly healthcare expenditure), which are attributed to direct healthcare costs, lost wages, impaired QOL, and value of statistical life, cost the United States trillions of dollars, annually (67\u201371).\n\nRecovery housing provides individuals with SUDs with ongoing support, structure, and life skills building, such as healthy eating and regular exercising, to improve their physical health. Recovery housing-based systems can be leveraged to link residents with interdisciplinary healthcare professionals to provide individualized treatment for their comorbid mental and physical health conditions, including pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical pain management methods. The high rates of self-reported mobility and pain/discomfort problems increase residents\u2019 risks for other comorbid conditions, polysubstance use, and relapse, underscoring the need to screen residents for pain and mobility problems and continuously monitor polysubstance use and safety to prevent opioid-related overdose deaths. Also, recovery housing staff should be trained to assess residents\u2019 functional limitations.\n\nWe found that female residents were more likely to report pain/discomfort problems than male residents, consistent with research that demonstrated pain prevalence and severity appear higher among women (72, 73). Although the precise underlying mechanisms that drive this disparity in pain level are obscure, it has been proposed that interrelated biological and psychosocial factors may contribute to these disparities (73\u201379). For instance, sex differences might exist in how the opioid receptors are activated in response to pain. Further, men and women are differently socialized to talk about and cope with painful experiences, including adverse childhood experiences. Thus, when compared to men, women will more often employ a diverse set of coping strategies, including relying on social support, while men typically use behavioral distraction or problem-focused approaches (77, 80). There are potential advantages in providing comprehensive, integrated care models that do not place the blame on female residents experiencing pain. Rather, interventions might be needed to support recovery residences\u2019 staff to link female residents to trauma-informed outpatient treatment programs and other services, including social support and mutual aid groups, which are central to improving substance use outcomes (81, 82). While sex differences existed in our sample only on the pain/discomfort dimension, other differences may exist. Future research with larger samples should explore sex differences across all HRQOL dimensions.\n\nParticipants who are married or in a committed relationship were more likely to report problems conducting self-care than single or never-married participants, contrary to previous research that reported married individuals have better HRQOL and health than single, divorced/separated, or bereaved individuals (83\u201385). This contrasting result may be because residents\u2019 partners also engage in opioid or other substance use, highlighting the need to provide behavioral couples therapy to residents and their married or cohabiting partners.\n\nThe highest proportion of participants reporting any HRQOL problem was in the anxiety/depression dimension. Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur with OUD and are risk factors for opioid misuse and OUD (15, 17). We also found that sexual minorities were more likely to report anxiety/depression problems than heterosexuals, consistent with previous researchers\u2019 findings that indicate sexual minorities have poorer HRQOL, and gay/bisexual men are more likely to report anxiety/depression problems than heterosexuals (86). Given that sexual minorities report worse health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, poor HRQOL, and health-related behaviors, than heterosexuals due to stigma and discrimination (86\u201388), culturally competent co-occurring mental health and SUDs treatment and support must be integrated into recovery residence-based systems of care.\n\nMost participants had high total, social, and personal RC, consistent with research that reported individuals with higher RC are more likely to identify and access substance use treatment than those with lower RC (89). Low personal RC was associated with problems in all HRQOL dimensions. Similarly, low total RC was associated with HRQOL problems, except mobility problems. Personal RC includes mental and physical health and education/vocational skills (41, 42). Indeed, most participants had attended some college or had a vocational/technical diploma or college degree and reported comorbid mental and physical diagnoses, which may account for the differences in HRQOL by personal RC observed. The presence of comorbid mental and physical conditions may be due to OUD or exacerbated by OUD, which decreases HRQOL (12). Future research should identify and assess the effects of all types of personal RC on HRQOL so recovery staff will better understand how to strengthen residents\u2019 RC to support their recovery and improve their HRQOL.\n\nThe logistic regression model suggests that social RC is not associated with any HRQOL dimension. Our finding is novel compared to previous researchers that reported significant associations between social RC and HRQOL (43, 45, 90). White and Cloud (42) suggest that long-term recovery is predicted by social and personal RC, with the impact of low personal RC being regulated by high social RC. Contrarily, using HRQOL as a proxy for long-term recovery, personal RC is a stronger predictor of long-term recovery, and high personal RC appears to regulate the impact of low social RC in our sample. Nonetheless, recovery homes can provide a safe and supportive environment for residents with low social RC to connect with their peers to improve their health, well-being, and recovery from OUD. This is critical as social capital, such as social support and connectedness obtained from social networks and supportive relationships, are protective against substance use, anxiety, and depression (41, 42, 91\u201393).\n\nOur results should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations. First, our analysis has a cross-sectional design, limiting our ability to assess causal relationships. Second, most participants were non-Hispanic White and resided in levels II and III certified recovery homes across five cities in Texas. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to other individuals with OUD. Furthermore, our analysis of RC and HRQOL relied on self-reported data, which may introduce social desirability and recall bias. Also, with a larger sample size, potentially meaningful differences that were not statistically significant in our sample might have been identified, e.g., sex differences across all HRQOL dimensions and not just the pain/discomfort dimension alone. Finally, the ARC scale assesses only two of the five RC domains; thus, total RC in our study refers to only the social and personal resources that residents can draw upon to initiate and sustain their recovery from OUD. Nonetheless, personal RC is the stronger predictor of HRQOL and long-term recovery among recovery residents with OUD.\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nOur analysis of data from individuals taking MOUD and residing in levels II and III recovery homes indicates that most residents have high RC. However, personal RC is a stronger predictor of HRQOL than social RC. Our findings underscore the importance of examining each RC domain and increasing RC to influence the HRQOL of individuals with OUD. We also found that comorbid conditions, including mental illness, respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular diseases, are highly prevalent and negatively impact HRQOL. Our results emphasize the need for policymakers to support the integration of MOUD and treatment for comorbid conditions, especially mental illness and chronic physical health conditions that result in pain, mobility issues, and problems conducting usual activities. Recovery is multidimensional and lifelong; thus, researchers and recovery residence administrators/staff should be trained to identify and understand RC and its influences on HRQOL to strengthen residents\u2019 existing or develop new RC. Recovery providers can support residents\u2019 recovery to improve opioid use outcomes and HRQOL by participating in intervention design, interprofessional models of care, and policies. This study adds to the HRQOL and RC literature by identifying the most frequently reported problems in five EQ-5D-5L HRQOL dimensions and predictors of poor HRQOL, i.e., female sex, sexual minority identity, married status, comorbid conditions, and low recovery capital, among recovery residents with OUD.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS).

Here\u2019s what you should know.", "published_at": "2018-04-19T00:00:00", "full_text": "It\u2019s easy to hide. It\u2019s addictive. It\u2019s the new, viral trend to hit schools and part of what the FDA has declared a teen vaping epidemic across the country. What is juuling?\n\nJuul is a type of electronic cigarette \u2013 one of the more popular brands \u2013 and inhaling it is known as \u201cjuuling.\u201d The maker of Juul has claimed that is intended for adult use only. However, due to its design, small size (easily concealable from teachers and parents) and flavors such as mint, cr\u00e8me brulee and mango, it has become appealing to adolescents, says Joseph Rosen, MD, pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist at The Woman\u2019s Hospital of Texas in Houston.\n\n\u201cE-cigarettes are now the most commonly used tobacco products among youth,\u201d Dr. Rosen said, \u201cand Juul, specifically, is the number one selling e-cigarette as of January 2018.\u201d\n\nSo, what do parents need to know? Dr. Rosen, who has co-authored two chapters on smoking and adolescents, explains.\n\nWhat makes the Juul unique?\n\nMost e-cigarettes are cylindrical, whereas the Juul looks like a USB flash drive. It can be charged by plugging it into a USB port on a laptop in the same way that a phone can be charged. Also, it does not have the distinctive smell of cigarettes, so it is more difficult for adults to detect when teens are juuling.\n\nWhere can it be purchased?\n\nJuul is an electronic nicotine delivery system. It can be purchased from any place that sells e-cigarettes or tobacco products. Also, it can be purchased online. The Juul online website requires at least some age verification, but third-party sellers may get around it. More expensive than traditional cigarettes or other e-cigarettes, a kit can run between 20 to 55 dollars. This may discourage some adolescents from using it.\n\nWhat is the purpose of e-cigarettes?\n\nFor the Juul, specifically, the creators claim that it is intended as an alternative to smoking cigarettes, not a method to stop smoking.\n\nDo e-cigarettes help people quit smoking?\n\nThere are mixed results on the research showing e-cigarettes ability to help adults quit smoking. There is no good evidence to show that e-cigarettes help adolescents quit smoking.\n\nWhat are the health risks of juuling?\n\nJuuling contains nicotine and that is extremely addictive. According to Juul, one pod contains about as much nicotine as one pack of cigarettes. A recent study revealed that the use of e-cigarettes by high school students doubled the risk for chronic bronchitis symptoms. Also, \u201cpopcorn lung\u201d, a medical condition formally known as bronchiolitis obliterans, may develop in e-cigarette users due to a chemical called diacetyl(1). That causative agent is used in more than 75 percent of e-cigarettes to produce flavors such as maple, coconut, vanilla or others. According to Juul, they do not add diacetyl and acetylproprionyl (or 2,3-pentanedione) as flavoring ingredients. That said, the ingredient list of the e-liquid formula used in Juul is not available to the public.\n\nIs juuling safer than smoking traditional cigarettes?\n\nIt took many decades to firmly demonstrate the dangers of cigarette smoking. There has not been adequate time to do these studies for e-cigarettes, which are relatively new. I am not aware of any studies comparing Juuling to smoking cigarettes. However, two new studies on e-cigarettes showed they contain cancer-causing chemicals and are associated with future cigarette smoking in teens.\n\nWhat do parents need to know about juuling?\n\nIn 2015, 37.7 percent of high school students had tried e-cigarettes and the use of e-cigarettes has been going up since then. Many youth who use e-cigarettes are unlikely to have initiated tobacco smoking with cigarettes. So, e-cigarettes are expanding overall use of tobacco products among youth, rather than replacing other sources. Most importantly, e-cigarettes (including Juul) are not a safe alternative to smoking. E-cigarettes should not be used for treatment of tobacco dependence in teens, as they have not been shown to be safe or effective.\n\nWhat advice would you give parents about juuling?\n\nBecause children whose parents do not smoke or who successfully quit smoking are much less likely to take up smoking, I strongly encourage parents to quit. It makes sense that the same would go for e-cigarettes. I encourage parents to:\n\nmaintain a smoke-free and e-cigarette-free (including Juuling) home,\n\ngive clear and consistent messages to their children that they expect them to remain non-smokers and \u201cnon-vapers/non-Juulers,\u201d\n\nwork on fostering resistance to social influences from peers by rehearsing refusal skills (Teaching of the mnemonic REAL (Refuse, Explain, Avoid, Leave) has been successful as part of a school-based substance prevention curriculum.),\n\ntalk to their children about the negative effects of smoking and e-cigarettes as young as 5 years old.\n\nDr. Joseph Rosen is a pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist at The Woman\u2019s Hospital of Texas, an affiliate of HCA Healthcare, and serves as Director of Sleep Medicine for Houston Pediatric Pulmonary and Sleep Associates.\n\nHCA Healthcare 50th Anniversary\n\nIn 1968, HCA Healthcare was conceived by two physicians and an accomplished business leader \u2014 Dr. Thomas Frist Sr., Dr. Thomas Frist Jr., and Jack Massey.

Beginning on that date, social media platforms would be required to display pop-up notifications that inform Colorado users under 18 about the potential harms to their mental and physical health from prolonged periods spent on social media. This message would appear after one hour of use each day, or if the user is on the platform between 10pm and 6am, and would reappear every 30 minutes.\n\nIn a poll commissioned by Healthier Colorado that was fielded in May and June of this year, 90% of Colorado voters said that social media had a \u201cnegative impact on the mental health of youth in Colorado.\u201d The same overwhelming majority also agreed with the statement that \u201cThere is a growing mental health crisis facing children and youth in Colorado.\u201d When provided with a description of HB24-1136, 69% of Colorado voters indicated that they supported this new law.\n\nIn response to the NetChoice lawsuit, Jake Williams, CEO of Healthier Colorado, issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cOur kids have been treated as guinea pigs in a profit-driven experiment by big tech. The results are in: social media use poses serious risks to youth mental health. These findings are confirmed by leaked documents from social media companies themselves, as well as the U.S. Surgeon General. The least we can do to protect our children is to let them know about these risks, which is what this law does. This common-sense approach empowers kids and families to make informed decisions, without imposing any restrictions on what content they consume. Social media companies are not entitled to unfettered access to our kids\u2019 brains. We will fight back against these companies to support Colorado families.\u201d\n\nRep. Rose Pugliese (R-Colorado Springs), a sponsor of HB24-1136 who also serves as Minority Leader for the House Republicans, stated: \u201cAs a parent, I know the challenge of raising children in the age of social media. What we as parents are seeing firsthand has also been confirmed by research: social media use is harmful for youth mental health and can lead to things like anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Parents cannot tackle these challenges on our own, and that\u2019s why this law is so important. This is a common-sense, family-focused law that provides young people and their parents with the knowledge and support they need to make informed decisions about safe social media usage.\u201d\n\nSen. Judy Amabile (D-Boulder), another sponsor of the law, added: \u201cThe longer teens spend doom scrolling on social media, the higher their chances of experiencing anxiety, depression, and emotional distress. Coloradans recognize that social media presents a growing public health problem for our youth, and they want their leaders to take action. Similar to the warnings we already place on many other consumer products, it\u2019s time we help teens make informed choices by providing them with the evidence-based information as well as the support and guidance they deserve to use social media safely.\u201d\n\nHealthier Colorado is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to raising the voices of Coloradans in the public policy process to improve the health of our state\u2019s residents. We believe that every Coloradan should have a fair chance at living a healthy life.\n\nMary Kate Morr is Director of Communications for Healthier Colorado.", "source_domain": "pagosadailypost.com", "article_id": "5a135848-cfff-463d-812a-1eeee152b67c", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

It is open to everybody.\n\n\u201cWe are doing rock climbing and paddle boarding in the harbour or on the beach and, through Solstice, it is equine therapy.\u201d\n\nDr Farquhar added: \u201cIt takes people out of their comfort zone, putting them in a situation where they are forced to act in a situation they are not used to being in and then using that as a tool to help them to understand their own personality and way of approaching things.\n\n\u201cIt is also about problem solving and putting people in anxiety provoking situations and helping them to control that and de-escalate their anxiety.\n\n\u201cIn a climbing situation it is obvious what the source of the fear is but in someone who has an anxiety disorder they may feel anxious without there being an obvious provocation so it\u2019s about putting them in a situation where not only have they got the anxiety but there is an obvious source for it, so it\u2019s about using that as a tool to help them to recognise it and to manage it.\u201d\n\nDr Farquhar, who has more 20 years of clinical experience in psychiatry, has worked in a variety of areas, including prisons, hospitals, outpatient clinics and in the community.\n\nDr Laura Henagulph, clinical psychologist at Atlantis, which is based on Hamilton\u2019s Reid Street, said: \u201cIn Bermuda where stigma exists, people often suffer with very frightening symptoms which they keep secret.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t tell anyone about them and these things worsen and it ends up with them having to go into tertiary care \u2014 bypassing primary and secondary services.\n\n\u201cThe Mid Atlantic Wellness Institute is a fantastic service but when you are very, very ill and you have lost touch with reality, the admission process itself can be very traumatic.\n\n\u201cI guess what we might want to do is to encourage everybody to seek help earlier so it doesn\u2019t get to the point where they have to go straight to tertiary care.\u201d\n\nDr Henagulph, a specialist in individual therapy for attachment disorders and relationship difficulties, has worked with organisations including the Department of Child and Family Services and the Department of Corrections.\n\nShe also has experience as an expert witness in criminal and civil courts.\n\nDr Henagulph said: \u201cWe would encourage anyone experiencing distressing symptoms to come forward and talk to someone about it no matter how shaming it seems.\n\n\u201cOur mission at Atlantis is to break down the stigma around the more severe end of mental illness \u2014 severe interpersonal issues \u2014 because there are treatments available and people do get better.\n\n\u201cIf you need help in that area it is imperative you go to an expert and you can start working on some of those issues before they start becoming severe or you start feeling isolated.

{"url": "https://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=61838", "title": "Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioids, Alcohol, Tobacco: What You Should Know", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Concern about opioids \u2013 especially the growing threat of overdose posed by illicit fentanyl \u2013 has created heightened awareness about treatment options for people with substance use disorders. One of the oldest and most effective is medication-assisted treatment (MAT).\n\nAlso frequently called medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), MAT is a proven treatment approved of by all major medical organizations, including the Texas Medical Association. It has faced stigma and misunderstanding, even among many health care professionals. But physician experts in addiction say it is a key tool in combating substance use disorder, especially for opioids.\n\nWhat is MAT or MOUD?\n\nMAT is the use of medications and counseling to treat people with substance use disorder. People addicted to alcohol and tobacco can benefit from MAT. But historically, the approach has been used to treat opioid use disorder treatment, so MAT is commonly referred to as MOUD, says Austin addiction psychiatrist Carlos Tirado, MD, a member of TMA\u2019s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health. The medications used are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Their use is coupled with counseling to help the patient deal with the psychological aspects of substance use disorder.\n\nIs MAT, or MOUD, effective?\n\nYes. Several studies show that compared to no treatment or treatments not involving medications, MOUD decreases risk of drug-related death and suicide by over 50%. The three medications used \u2013 methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone \u2013 are consistently associated with improved health outcomes, including reductions in opioid use and transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. MAT is similarly effective in treating alcohol use disorder, and smokers who receive a combination of behavioral treatment and cessation medications quit at higher rates than those who receive minimal intervention, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\u201cWe know this is the standard of care for opioid use disorder,\u201d said Ann Marie Case, MD, an Austin addiction specialist. \u201cWe\u2019ve known that since the 1970s and we\u2019ve known that it works.\u201d\n\nAnd since physicians no longer must obtain an X waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, physicians who are not addiction specialists can more easily offer MOUD to patients, she says.\n\nWhy is there stigma about MAT?\n\nPerhaps the most common misconception about MAT is the patient is switching one addiction for another.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge component of the stigma that I see among my colleagues when I get phone calls or get asked to consult,\u201d Dr. Case said.\n\nHowever, that belief is not founded in truth. These medications normalize brain chemistry, block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids, relieve physiological cravings, and normalize body functions without the negative and euphoric effects of the substance used, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nLike any medication, those used in MAT can be misused. But in the overwhelming number of cases, it\u2019s not, Dr. Tirado says. And the stigma against medication assistance for opioid use disorder, in particular, means that at least 87% of people who need this treatment are not getting it, according to a recent study.\n\n\u201cMost of my patients know there\u2019s a treatment from what they\u2019ve heard on the street from other people, not from a health care professional,\u201d Dr. Case added.\n\nHow important is the counseling aspect for MAT?\n\nJust like other chronic conditions, substance use disorder requires that medication be coupled with other types of treatment to maximize its effect, Dr. Tirado says. In the case of MAT, that other treatment is counseling, which helps people learn how to resist drug use and build healthier relationships.\n\n\u201cPsychosocial interventions, addressing comorbidities \u2013 be they physical or psychiatric \u2013 those are all part of what we call a plan of sustained recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does require a comprehensive approach.\u201d\n\nHere are several physician resources for MAT and MOUD:", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org", "article_id": "ed034466-7cff-401e-a0eb-54a1a0257867", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

One of the biggest concerns fellow physicians have is that MAT just switches one addiction for another \u2013 such as using buprenorphine to treat addiction to another opioid.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge component of the stigma that I see among my colleagues when I get phone calls or get asked to consult,\u201d Dr. Case said.\n\nWhile the belief is unfounded, it\u2019s understandable that physicians still think that way, says Michael Sprintz, DO, a Houston-area specialist in addiction medicine and pain medicine. Except for physicians who recently graduated from medical school, most had little or no training in those four years about how to handle a patient with a substance use disorder.\n\n\u201cAs physicians, whenever we dive into a new area we haven\u2019t been trained in, it brings a level of anxiety because our biggest concern is keeping our patient safe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe widespread stigma against MAT also is based on a misunderstanding about the goal of treatment for substance use disorder, Dr. Sprintz says.\n\n\u201cThe goal is not just chemical abstinence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary goal is helping people develop self-awareness, skills, and tools to handle life on life\u2019s terms \u2013 what I call \u2018emotional sobriety.\u2019\u2026 The value of medication-assisted treatment is that it helps people stick around in treatment, so they can learn all the other things that they need to learn about living a life without needing drugs or alcohol. MAT enables people to focus on something other than getting out of withdrawal or feeding an overwhelming craving that drives people to leave treatment early.\u201d\n\nBut the stigma against medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder in particular means 86.6% of people who need this treatment are not getting it, according to a study published in the December 2022 International Journal of Drug Policy .\n\n\u201cMost of my patients know there\u2019s a treatment from what they\u2019ve heard on the street from other people, not from a health care professional,\u201d Dr. Case said.\n\nA better understanding of MAT \u2013 combined with recent changes in federal law about prescribing these medications and required physician education on the subject \u2013 will allow a much broader group of doctors not involved in addiction medicine not only to help tackle the opioid crisis but also to make sick people well again, Dr. Sprintz says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll start to see what you couldn\u2019t see before,\u201d he said.\n\nHow MAT works\n\nThe medications for MAT are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and extremely safe and effective, Dr. Case says. In fact, MAT is the best way to treat opioid use disorder and is now commonly referred to as MOUD, or medication for opioid use disorders.\n\n\u201cWe know [MOUD] is the standard of care for opioid use disorder,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known that since the 1970s, and we\u2019ve known that it works.\u201d\n\nMAT also can help patients combat the powerful addictions to alcohol and tobacco, says Austin addiction psychiatrist Carlos Tirado, MD, a member of TMA\u2019s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health.\n\n\u201c[The medications] reduce heavy drinking and the medical problems associated with excessive alcohol use,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it can help people reduce and quit smoking.\u201d\n\nThe combination of medication and counseling used in MAT is not much different from treatments for other chronic diseases, Dr. Tirado says. For instance, treating diabetes requires medication as well as counseling for weight loss and physical activity while addressing emotional and socioeconomic concerns that affect the disease.\n\n\u201cIn that way, [treating] substance use disorder is no different,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychosocial interventions, addressing comorbidities \u2013 be they physical or psychiatric \u2013 those are all part of what we call a plan of sustained recovery. It does require a comprehensive approach.\u201d\n\nThe medications used in MAT normalize brain chemistry, relieve physiological cravings, and normalize body functions without the negative and euphoric effects of the substance used, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe medications fall into three broad categories, Dr. Tirado explains. Some, like buprenorphine, essentially replace a more harmful, highly addictive opioid, like heroin, with one that is longer acting and prevents physical withdrawal and craving but is much safer. Others, like naltrexone, are opioid antagonists that block the effect of the opioid or reduce the rewarding effect of alcohol. Still others create an adverse reaction to the addictive drug, the way disulfiram makes people sick after drinking alcohol, for instance.\n\nAs with many medicines, those used for MAT can be abused, Dr. Tirado says. But in the overwhelming number of cases, they\u2019re not, and they have a great track record.\n\nSeveral studies show that compared with no treatment or treatments not involving medications, MOUD decreases overdose risk with opioids by more than 50%. The three medications used for MOUD \u2013 methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone \u2013 are consistently associated with improved health outcomes, including reduced opioid use, transmission of HIV and hepatitis C, and overdose risk, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re either more or as effective as other treatments applied to other chronic conditions,\u201d Dr. Tirado said.\n\n\n\nA role for all physicians\n\nCongress\u2019 recent passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 made two important changes in the way physicians handle substance use disorder that affect MAT, and those changes may open the door for physicians not involved in addiction medicine to play a bigger role.\n\nFirst, lawmakers did away with the X waiver for prescribing buprenorphine, which required eight hours of training as well as rigid documentation for prescriptions and the potential for inspection by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents. That is already making physicians more comfortable with the idea of prescribing buprenorphine for MAT, Dr. Tirado says.\n\n\u201cWith the elimination of the X waiver for buprenorphine to prescribe, I think we\u2019re still going to have a need for addiction specialists,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have a lot more capacity [among other physicians] to initiate care.\u201d\n\nSecond, the law requires a new one-time, eight-hour training on how to treat patients with opioid or other substance use disorders for all physicians registering or renewing their registration for a DEA license, starting June 27.\n\nMany physicians see the new requirement as an unnecessary burden, and the American Medical Association tried to block it. The American Society for Addiction Medicine endorsed it.\n\nDr. Sprintz argues the new rule can help nearly all physicians.\n\nVirtually all medical practices have at least some patients with undiagnosed substance use disorders, he says. Learning the basics of addiction can save physicians time and money because they\u2019ll be able to recognize those patients and get them treated with MAT or refer them to appropriate care.\n\n\u201cA patient with an untreated substance use disorder is a real challenge to a practice,\u201d Dr. Sprintz said. \u201cBeing able to identify a patient with a [substance use disorder] and helping to get appropriate treatment helps the patient, the practice, and the health care system overall.\u201d\n\nAddiction medicine specialists cannot treat all the Texas patients who need their help, especially those in rural areas with limited medical services, Dr. Tirado says. Other physicians now have a better chance to help patients with uncomplicated cases who typically have no other medical options.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org", "article_id": "6347eebb-fb92-4b9c-8f89-3f4ad4b83edd", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

In the United States alone, almost 108,000 people died from drug overdose in 2022, and about 75% of those deaths involved opioids.\n\nAlthough many factors contribute to this crisis\u2014and there are many approaches to addressing it as a result\u2014one important line of research is into the genetic factors that increase people\u2019s risk for developing an opioid use disorder (OUD). Once these risk factors are known, doctors may be able to prescribe opioids more strategically to people at higher risk of OUD, and such individuals could make more informed choices.\n\nIn recently published research, scientists from the University of Colorado Boulder\u2014including Eamonn Duffy, Jack Ward, Luanne Hale, Kyle Brown and Ryan Bachtell of the Bachtell Laboratory, and Andrew Kwilasz, Erika Mehrhoff, Laura Saba and Marissa Ehringer\u2014tested the influence of genetics on opioid-related behaviors, which include OUD. Specifically, they looked at its heritability by conducting an experiment in which rats were given the ability to self-administer oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid that is used medically to treat pain.\n\nCU Boulder researchers tested the influence of genetics on opioid-related behaviors, specifically looking at its heritability by conducting an experiment in which rats were given the ability to self-administer oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid that is used medically to treat pain. (Photo: Jon Anders Wiken/Dreamstime.com)\n\nExperimental design\n\nMore than 260 inbred rats from 15 strains were used for the study. In this case, an inbred strain is defined as a population produced by 20 or more generations of brother-sister mating. This was important for the study because the rats within inbred strain are isogenic: \u201cThey\u2019re almost like clones; their genomes are identical, except for the X and Y chromosomes between males and females,\u201d Duffy explains.\n\nLike the use of identical-twin research involving humans, this makes the results more reliable. In a twin study, most differences between twins are caused by their environment, so researchers can determine the genetic influence on a trait by how much it varies. Similarly, within an inbred strain, most individual differences are caused by sex differences, and this provides insight into the importance of biological sex to a given trait. Between inbred strains, differences are attributable to either the strains\u2019 different genes, sex differences, or a combination of the two.\n\nThe animals in the study could self-administer the oxycodone using levers, so their behaviors could be measured. There were two retractable levers in the testing chamber: one active, which would give the rats a dose of oxycodone after being pulled, and one inactive, which would do nothing.\n\nAfter the active lever was pulled, there was a cooldown period of 20 seconds, during which time pulling the lever would not dispense another dose. Regardless of whether pulling a lever had an effect, it would be recorded. This allowed researchers to measure two substance-use behaviors in addition to the total amount of oxycodone consumed. These variables were referred to as \u201ctimeout responding\u201d and \u201clever discrimination.\u201d\n\nTimeout responses were pulls on the active lever that happened during the cooldown period. Lever discrimination was a measure of how often rats pulled the inactive lever. Both essentially tracked the rats\u2019 ability to self-administer substances in a regulated manner, although lever discrimination could have other associations. Attempting to get more oxycodone very quickly (timeout responding) and attempting to get it in an illogical way (low lever discrimination, especially once the animals had time to learn how the levers worked) are signs of dysregulated drug use.\n\nThese measures are important in addition to total dosage because the rats naturally consumed more oxycodone as they developed a tolerance to the drug, making it difficult to characterize their drug use on that basis alone. \u201cWith addiction,\u201d Duffy says, \u201cit\u2019s a complicated story. They\u2019re developing tolerance, and they\u2019re showing dysregulated use.\u201d\n\nPush the lever, get the oxycodone\n\nThe tests were split into two phases: acquisition and escalation. Although the number of daily doses the rats received generally increased over time, especially between the two phases, their self-administration behaviors varied significantly by strain.\n\nFor example, in the escalation phase, the females of one strain pushed the lever for a total oxycodone dose of less than 100 mg/kg, whereas rats of another strain took a total of about 300. There was also variation between males and females within a strain, though not always: In some strains, males and females consumed a similar amount of oxycodone, while in others, consumption was notably divergent, with males consuming around 200 mg/kg more oxycodone overall.\n\nOnce the genetic factors that increase people's risk for developing an opioid use disorder (OUD) are known, doctors may be able to prescribe opioids more strategically to people at higher risk of OUD, and such individuals could make more informed choices. (Photo illustration: iStock)\n\nThis is evidence for a strain-sex interaction, meaning that the rats\u2019 substance-use behaviors were determined by a combination of genetic background and biological sex, not either alone, according to the researchers. Although the obvious explanation for this would be different genes encoded on the sex chromosomes of the various strains, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case.\n\n\u201cSome of our collaborators in San Diego have performed several genetic mapping studies,\u201d Duffy says, \u201cand they found that the Y chromosome didn\u2019t appear to play much of a role in regulating behavioral traits.\u201d\n\nIt is possible that X-chromosome genes are a greater factor. However, the biggest influence would probably be sex hormones or related differences, Duffy adds. For example, according a separate study, the sex hormone estradiol can increase oxycodone metabolism indirectly by raising the concentration of a protein in the brain.\n\nMoreover, Duffy says, \u201cthere could be developmental aspects to the sex difference, so seeing if they\u2019re exposed to testosterone versus estrogen as they\u2019re growing up, that may affect how their brain is wired.\u201d\n\nSeveral other strains showed notably divergent behaviors. Some strains were fairly stable in their use, while others increased their oxycodone intake rapidly during the acquisition phase. Lever discrimination also varied by strain, with one strain increasing its lever discrimination quickly, for example, while another failed to increase its lever discrimination much over time.\n\nThe biggest discovery that emerged from the research was the discovery of how heritable several behaviors related to opioid use are.\n\nThe influence of genetics\n\nHeritability is a measure of what part of the variation in a group is due to genetic or heritable characteristics.\n\n\u201cWith heritability,\u201d Duffy explains, \u201cwhen you\u2019re looking at everything that goes into some kind of trait, like opioid use disorder, the average genetic component will be your heritability. You also have environmental influences, which could be things such as diet.\u201d\n\nTaking OUC as an example, variation might be understood qualitatively in terms of how destructive the effects of drug use are on individuals, from having minimal effect on people\u2019s lives to potentially causing overdoses and death, Duffy adds.\n\nIf the heritability of OUD were 0, the fact that some people use the drug safely and others die because of it would be explained entirely by non-genetic factors. If the heritability of OUD were 1, this fact would be explained entirely by genetics. However, as with most traits, OUD appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nAccording to the study, measures of oxycodone intake ranged between 0.26 and 0.54 heritability. The high end of this range is total oxycodone intake over the course of the experiment, while the low end is change in intake (increase in intake over the acquisition phase). The other behavioral phenotypes had heritability scores of 0.25 to 0.42, with timeout responding being more heritable than lever discrimination.\n\n\u201cAbout half of that variability is due to genetic background,\u201d Duffy says, referring to total intake. \u201cThat\u2019s really strong heritability.\u201d However, because these data come from rats, the heritability of these behavioral phenotypes may be different in humans. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to capture everything about OUD in a rat model, but we can capture specific aspects and use that to put together a bigger picture.\n\n\u201cOUD is hard to study in humans because there aren\u2019t as many people using opioids as alcohol or nicotine, and of that smaller population, we also have people using several types of drugs, so it\u2019s harder to calculate these heritability values, but I believe ours do fall within the range for opioid dependence and opioid use disorder in humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith addiction, it\u2019s a complicated story. They\u2019re developing tolerance, and they\u2019re showing dysregulated use.\u201d\n\nIt's also important to recognize that heritability is a population-level statistic. This means that it does not represent the chance for any individual to develop a trait, even if that trait could be inherited from the individual\u2019s parents. However, a higher heritability of some trait would correspond to a greater resemblance between parents and offspring in that respect throughout the population, Duffy says.\n\nWhat genes contribute to OUD?\n\nWhile it is useful to know how heritable opioid use disorder is, meaningfully assessing the risk for individuals requires knowing what genes contribute to it. This study doesn\u2019t identify these genes, but progress has already been made to this end.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ve been a number of studies in humans that have found that these SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, are associated with your risk of developing conditions like opioid dependence or opioid use disorder,\u201d Duffy says. \u201cThere\u2019s another group that is performing some genetic mapping in outbred rats, and that\u2019s going to be the next stage of this project for us as well.\u201d\n\nOne potential gene influencing OUD in mice is an SNP in the Oprm1 gene, which is explained in the study to affect the brain\u2019s response to reward-related behavior generally and analgesics like oxycodone specifically. Common Oprm1 SNPs have also been associated with dysregulated use of an opioid in humans, specifically heroin.\n\nOnce relevant SNPs are identified, however, the situation remains complex. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a simple answer,\u201d Duffy says. \u201cLike, you have this one SNP in Oprm1 and that\u2019s going to increase or influence your risk for OUD. It\u2019s probably going to be a multitude of SNPs, and those additive effects are going to influence the risk for this disorder.\u201d\n\nDid you enjoy this article? Subscribe to our newsletter.

Despite the severity of this issue, the neurological mechanisms underlying opioid addiction, withdrawal and relapse are not fully understood.\n\nA study recently published in Cell Reports sheds light on the subject. Jun Wang, associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics at the Texas A&M University School of Medicine, and members of his laboratory have identified a specific brain circuit that characterizes how fentanyl (a synthetic opioid) affects the brain. Specifically, they looked at the striatum, which is a brain region that controls voluntary behaviors and is heavily implicated in drug relapse.\n\nEven after a long period of abstaining from opioids, many people relapse as a result of the depression, anxiety and other negative emotions that accompany withdrawal. Suppressing these negative emotional states could greatly increase a person\u2019s chance of overcoming opioid use disorder.\n\nOpioid addiction is mainly mediated by mu-opioid receptors (MORs), which are expressed in the midbrain and the striatum on a type of neuron called direct pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs). Previous studies from the Wang lab showed these dMSNs control \u201cgo\u201d actions in the brain that promote drug-seeking behaviors. The striatum contains two distinct sub-compartments, the patch and matrix compartments. The patch compartments primarily contain MOR-expressing dMSNs and are widely studied for their roles in emotional processing and decision-making.\n\nThe study aimed to look at how withdrawal from chronic opioid exposure alters the activity of patch dMSNs and their outputs to generate the negative emotional states which may cause relapse. The researchers discovered that fentanyl enhances the activity of dMSNs in the striatum, and during the early stages of withdrawal, inhibitory signals from these dMSNs to downstream targets, such as dopaminergic neurons, were significantly enhanced. Dopaminergic neurons play a major role in addiction as they control motivation, rewarding behavior and emotions. The enhanced suppression of dopaminergic neurons likely contributes to the negative emotions that arise during acute fentanyl withdrawal, as the researchers found that inhibiting these dMSNs can reduce withdrawal symptoms and anxiety-like behaviors.\n\nThe findings of this research provide new insights into the mechanism underlying opioid-induced negative emotional states, and pave the way for potential treatments for opioid use disorders. By reducing the negative emotional states that accompany withdrawal, it may be possible to reduce the risk of relapse and decrease the number of lives lost to opioids.\n\nIn summary, the study provides new understanding of the brain circuits involved in opioid addiction and withdrawal and could lead to the development of new treatment for opioid use disorders.", "source_domain": "stories.tamu.edu", "article_id": "6734f472-6a03-4e03-aee3-8355439eefdd", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Its behavioral health sector offers services from outpatient counseling to inpatient care.\n\n\u201cThere are really long wait times in the community to see a psychiatrist, waiting on average six months, which is really hard,\u201d Dr. Bachini said. \u201cIf you\u2019re at the point where you\u2019ve reached out to a psychiatrist, you need help now, or else you wouldn\u2019t be reaching out.\u201d\n\nFollowing the pandemic, Phoenix Children\u2019s stationed psychiatric nurse practitioners in its emergency departments, allowing assessments and treatment \u2014 including medication \u2014 for children waiting for psychiatric services.

Children\u2019s Health and the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute launched an initiative to address pediatric mental health challenges and are expanding the program to reach 150,000 families in its first year.\n\n\u00a0In 2020, children ages 5-11 increased mental health emergency room visits by 24 percent. Older children saw a 31 percent increase in mental health ER visits. Children\u2019s and MMHPI sought a more proactive approach to diagnosing and treating pediatric mental health by giving 75 providers additional training. Because of a shortage of mental health providers, the initiative is meant to train pediatricians to detect and treat mild to moderate behavioral health conditions like anxiety, stress, and depression. Most mental health issues for children are mild to moderate and can be treated in a primary care setting.\n\nAccording to the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, 2 in 5 children in Dallas County face mental health and substance use disorders. Still, just 10 percent of children receive mental healthcare in integrated and primary care settings.\u00a0\n\nMedical City Green Oaks executive medical director Dr. Ronnie Pollard\u00a0talked\u00a0to\u00a0D Magazine\u00a0in 2021 about the influx he saw at their hospital during the time. The 125-bed behavioral health hospital for children and adults normally reserves 12 beds for pediatric mental health patients. In the fall of 2020, demand forced them to convert an adult unit to a pediatric one, taking the total to 36 beds. The psychiatric hospital was filling up with teenagers in critical distress.\n\n\u201cWe have a deep responsibility to care for our children\u2019s mental health in a faster, more efficient way,\u201d said Dr. Sabrina Browne, a pediatric psychiatrist at Children\u2019s Health and assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center. \u201cWe simply cannot afford to experience a delay in care. Through this initiative, we\u2019ve empowered 75 pediatric providers in our first year to build upon their expertise to identify and treat a wider range of mental health diagnoses, shortening the amount of time to begin treatment.\u201d\n\nThe training included online and in-person at Children\u2019s Health\u2019s first-in-the-nation learning laboratory for integrated pediatric care. The lab will soon move to Reimagine Redibird development, where training and consultation will be available for community pediatricians as well as patient evaluations and treatment.\n\nData collected by Children\u2019s and MMHPI found that pediatricians involved in the initiative increased screening tools and used consultation provided by the state\u2019s\u00a0Child Psychiatry Access Network\u00a0to treat more mental health issues. Providers reported improved confidence in evaluating psychological conditions, improved billing strategies for behavioral health visits, and improved ability to use tools to identify depression and anxiety earlier.\n\nMore than 85 percent of those in the program said they would recommend the program to other providers and found that the training was an effective way to improve billing methods through Medicaid that will allow doctors to integrate mental health screening into their primary care practice.\n\n\u201cWhat makes initiatives like this so important is the fact that mental illness is a pediatric disease, with 50 percent of most illnesses emerging by age 14, so this initiative provides an essential path forward for pediatricians, children, and their families,\u201d said Andy Keller, president and chief executive officer of the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. \u201cWe have already seen a huge impact in the lives of hundreds of North Texas families and look forward to the future of this initiative as they continue to provide better, more accessible mental healthcare to young people and their families.\u201d\n\nAuthor\nWill Maddox\nView Profile\nWill is the senior writer for D CEO magazine and the editor of D CEO Healthcare.

That\u2019s why the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute is traveling across Texas -- and stopped in Fort Worth this week to hear some powerful stories.\n\nDuring the first 90 days of his tour in Vietnam, Michael Killam says he felt invincible.\n\n\u201cI had weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cI had power over life and death. I could make people live or I could let them die. I became God-like.\u201d\n\nKillam was only 19 at the time. During his tour, he was captured for three days, hung upside down, and tortured for hours. Eventually, he escaped and returned to duty.\n\n\u201cWe went to an orphanage that had been mortared,\u201d Killam said. \u201cAnd we had to get the kids out. I found a little baby. It had something in its chest. I pulled it out and its last breath came out ... and a lady slapped me and called me a baby killer. And I thought for a long time that I killed that baby. And my kids, I had four daughters. I wouldn\u2019t touch them. I thought I\u2019d kill them.\u201d\n\nFor decades, he\u2019s had flashbacks.\n\n\u201cEvery time it happened, I\u2019d end up in the back of a police car,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they tried to take me, I\u2019d fight like hell, I thought I was getting captured again.\u201d\n\nArlington Mayor Robert Cluck says he sees too many police vehicles in front of the emergency room.\n\n\u201cWe need to decriminalize mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like if you have an appendicitis, we shouldn\u2019t send a police car out to go and pick you up, take care of you.\u201d\n\nCluck is also a doctor, and serves as the vice president for medical affairs at Arlington Memorial Hospital.\n\n\u201cLife is stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cFamilies are stressful.

She says Tarrant County has built a robust crisis service system, including one that helps police officers called The Law Liaison program.\n\n\u201cPerhaps they\u2019ve been called out to a scene and they\u2019re trying to determine if this a mental health matter,\u201d she said. \u201cIs the person already known to the mental health system? ... What advice do our staff have for them? Is it the sort of circumstance where our staff need to come out on scene?\u201d\n\nMHMR already has a mobile crisis outreach team that\u2019s available 24 hours a day, to help anyone. Garnett says the police line averaged only 60 calls a month when it started. Today, that number is 800.\n\nArlington\u2019s Police Department recently teamed with MHMR on a new program, says Lt.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS)4 can be used to estimate trends in ED visits involving underage alcohol misuse. The HCUP NEDS is a nationally representative database of community hospital\u2013based ED visits collected by AHRQ. Data are collected for all visits in participating hospital-based EDs regardless of expected payer or inpatient admission status. For each visit, data are available on selected patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, ED discharge status, primary payer, and total ED and inpatient charges.\n\nUsing the NEDS data from 2010 to 2013, ED visits involving underage alcohol misuse were identified using the age and diagnosis fields. ED visits for patients aged 12 to 20 with one of the following ICD-9-CM codes in any diagnostic or E-code field were included in this analysis: 980.0, 303.00, 303.01, 303.02, 305.00, 305.01, 305.02, 790.3, and E860.0. (Table S1 lists the ICD-9-CM codes used to identify the alcohol misuse\u2013related visits.) These codes, which include alcohol toxicity, alcohol poisoning, and alcohol abuse, were selected to limit the visits that were included in the analysis to cases of acute alcohol poisoning and nondependent abuse among underage patients.5 Visits were then stratified into alcohol-only visits and drug and alcohol combination visits. Underage alcohol misuse\u2013related visits were classified as combination visits if they included at least one drug-related ICD-9-CM code, in any diagnostic position or E-Code field, listed in Table S2. Visits that were missing data on age or gender were excluded from the analysis.\n\nRates of underage alcohol misuse\u2013related ED visits were calculated using age- and gender-specific population estimates of adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 20 from the U.S. Census Bureau. Alcohol misuse\u2013related ED visit rates were calculated for males and females aged 12 to 20 and separately for those aged 12 to 14, 15 to 17, and 18 to 20; all of the reported rates were stratified by gender. Adolescents aged 12 to 17 were stratified into two separate age groups because past research has shown that the patterns of gender differences among those aged 12 to 14 and those aged 15 to 17 are different.1 Alcohol misuse\u2013related ED visits are expressed as the number of ED visits per 100,000 adolescents or young adults by year.\n\nChi-square two sample t-tests were used to test for differences in proportions between alcohol-only visits and drug and alcohol combination visits for demographic characteristics including gender, age group, disposition (treated and released, admitted, other, etc.), and the presence of an injury-related ICD-9-CM diagnosis code recorded on the claim. Separate Poisson regression models were run in samples that were stratified by gender. Poisson regression models with a continuous time variable, a gender variable, and a time by gender interaction term were also used to examine changes in the trends in the rates of alcohol-only and drug and alcohol combination ED visits by time and gender. Trends are described as increasing or decreasing only when the changes over time were statistically significant at the 0.05 level. By examining the combined effects of gender, age, and time on underage alcohol misuse\u2013related ED visits, it will be possible to determine whether the gender trends in underage alcohol misuse\u2013related ED visits are consistent with the changes in drinking behaviors observed in people aged 12 to 20.", "source_domain": "www.samhsa.gov", "article_id": "f609e9fa-2cf8-4dac-b0fb-71abea16e8ae", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}
{"url": "https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/high-speed-rail-projects-california-nevada-texas-atlanta-washington/731379/", "title": "High-speed rail projects progress in California, Texas and other states", "published_at": "2024-10-31T10:00:00", "full_text": "Editor's note: This is Part 2 in Smart Cities Dive's series on the future of U.S. high-speed rail. Part 1 provides the current outlook for U.S. high-speed rail and its history to date. Part 3 examines the challenges to creating a national high-speed rail network.\n\nIt was an audacious idea: build a 200-mph passenger rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles unlike anything that has ever existed in the United States. In 2008, California state legislators put Proposition 1A on the ballot, asking voters to approve a $9.95 billion bond issue to get the project started. Largely favored by Democrats and environmental advocates, the project also enjoyed the support of then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. The ballot measure passed with almost 53% of the vote.\n\nBut 16 years later, no one has ridden a high-speed train in California. A 119-mile segment of the 494-mile project is under construction in the state\u2019s Central Valley, an agricultural region. High-speed trains aren\u2019t expected to run there until 2030 at the earliest. Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped others across the U.S. from investing, planning and beginning to build high-speed rail projects.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for high-speed rail,\u201d investor Wes Edens told Smart Cities Dive. Edens is the co-founder and CEO of Fortress Investment Group, which backs the Brightline West project to connect Las Vegas and Southern California with 200-mph trains.\n\nAdvocates cite benefits ranging from reduced highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions to time savings and job creation. \u201cThe more time that you save people, the more likely it is for them to take your train,\u201d Edens said. The sweet spot for high-speed rail lines that will entice private investors are city pairs that are \u201ctoo far to drive and too short to fly,\u201d he said.\n\nTraditional public transit strongholds are not the only places you\u2019ll find government support of high-speed rail today. The states of Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington and Tennessee, along with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, are among the entities actively planning new high-speed rail projects. And Amtrak is evaluating a partnership with Texas Central Partners on a Dallas-Houston line. Here is a look at where these projects stand.\n\nLos Angeles Union Station, which opened in 1939 in the heart of downtown LA, will serve as the terminal for bullet trains from San Francisco if the California High-Speed Rail Authority can find funding to complete the line. Courtesy of California High-Speed Rail Authority\n\nCalifornia\u2019s big idea faces big challenges\n\nThe proposed San Francisco to Los Angeles line, managed since 1996 by the California High-Speed Rail Authority, has a checkered history. Estimated costs have ballooned from $33 billion in 2008 to up to nearly $128 billion in 2024. The authority\u2019s 2008 business plan described a system carrying more than 90 million passengers across an 800-mile network annually by 2030; its latest 2024 business plan now projects 28.4 million riders along a 494-mile network by 2040 \u2014 if it can find the money to continue building. \u201cWe have some significant financial challenges that are ahead of us,\u201d said Anthony Williams, a member of the California High-Speed Rail Authority\u2019s board of directors and director of public policy for Amazon in California.\n\nCalifornia LA-SF high-speed rail project Comparison of cost, full length and projected ridership in 2008 and 2024.\n\nDelays, cost overruns and management issues came to the fore in a 2018 report from the California state auditor. It faulted the authority for over-reliance on consultants, poor contract management and high turnover among its contract managers. When Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, came into office in 2019, he said in his first state-of-the-state address, \u201cThe project, as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long.\u201d He backed away from the aspiration of linking San Francisco, LA, Sacramento and San Diego, committing only to a smaller project in the state\u2019s Central Valley. That\u2019s where construction is underway now, between Bakersfield and Merced, California.\n\n\u201cHistorically, doing this kind of thing has never been easy,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe also had some challenges at the beginning about how to get it right.\u201d\n\nThe project became the target of some Republicans in this Congress, who added a provision to the House fiscal year 2025 transportation appropriations bill that would prohibit the project from receiving federal funds.\n\n\u201cMost people in this country, when they think about high-speed rail in the United States, tend to gravitate towards [the California project] because that's the one that's been going on for quite some time,\u201d said Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Transportation Trades Department. \u201cThe problem is that how ambitious it is and has been, it's going to draw a target on its own back.\u201d\n\nSupport for the project in Washington has shifted back and forth in the past five years. While the Trump administration tried to kill a previously awarded $929 million federal grant and threatened to claw back $2.5 billion in federal funds from the authority, the Biden administration last year gave it $3.07 billion.\n\nIn recent months, the California High-Speed Rail Authority received environmental clearance for the final segment of the LA-San Francisco line and appointed a new CEO, but Williams admits there are still challenges ahead. Currently available, authorized and expected future funding totals $35.2 billion, enough to finish the first segment. But that leaves a $93 billion gap to meet the estimated cost for a line that runs all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles. \u201cAt this time, we do not have a specified timeline for project segments outside the Central Valley, as the necessary funding has not yet been secured,\u201d the authority states in its 2024 draft business plan.\n\nBoth the state and the federal government will have to step up their commitments, Williams said. \u201cWe're making a promise about how high-speed rail is going to transform transportation and future economic development, particularly in the Central Valley,\u201d he said.\n\nBrightline founder Wes Edens (fifth from left) and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (right of Edens) join other dignitaries in hammering the first spikes during a groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the future Brightline West station in Las Vegas on April 22, 2024. Ethan Miller via Getty Images\n\nLas Vegas line attracts private investors\n\nWhile the California project has relied entirely on public funds to date, Brightline West is investing its own capital into a $12 billion project between Las Vegas and Southern California. The project has also been awarded up to $3 billion from the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program and will have access to up to $3.5 billion in private activity bonds from the U.S. Department of Transportation. These bonds are tax-exempt, significantly lowering the cost of capital for Brightline West, which must repay them.\n\n\u201cThe private sector can provide a significant impetus,\u201d said Edens. \u201cBut especially when you're trying to develop the first [high-speed rail line], government support is necessary. And fortunately, we have a government now that believes in that.\u201d\n\nBrightline West began construction in April. Its 218-mile line from Las Vegas to Rancho Cucamonga, California, about 42 miles east of Los Angeles Union Station, will mainly run in the median of Interstate 15, with intermediate stops in Victor Valley and Hesperia, California. At Rancho Cucamonga, it will connect with commuter railroad Metrolink for those continuing on to other Los Angeles-area destinations. Constructing the line along an existing transportation corridor eased the permitting process and allowed the federal environmental review to speed through. Brightline West aims to complete construction in 2028.\n\nEdens sees \u201cmany really compelling city pairs around the country\u201d for high-speed rail and said that \u201cthere's lots of capital availability\u201d as well as interest among the investment community to participate in these projects. He highlighted the \u201cTexas triangle\u201d \u2014 Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin \u2014 as one of the most compelling opportunities.\n\nConcerned landowners look over specifics of the proposed route of a high-speed rail line by Texas Central Partners at a public hearing on Jan. 31, 2018, in Fairfield, Texas. Amtrak has now taken the lead on this project. Dug Begley/Houston Chronicle/AP\n\nTexas may be next\n\nA project to connect Dallas and Houston with a high-speed rail line dates back at least 10 years. It saw little progress this decade until Amtrak got involved last year. In an interview with Smart Cities Dive, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called the Texas Central project \u201cone of the most promising proposals.\u201d\n\nAmtrak and Texas Central announced in August 2023 that they were evaluating a potential partnership to move the project forward. A year later, Andy Byford, Amtrak\u2019s senior vice president of high-speed rail development programs, announced at the Southwestern Rail Conference that Amtrak is taking the lead on the project, and an Amtrak spokesperson said at the time that the rail company is conducting due diligence. The partnership is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, and Amtrak declined to make Byford available for an interview for this story.\n\n\u201cWith Amtrak entering the scene on this, it gives new life to it,\u201d said Peter LeCody, president and chair of Texas Rail Advocates, a nonprofit advocate for high-speed rail in Texas. LeCody said Amtrak has moved the project to the third and final step of the Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s Corridor Identification and Development Program. The program, authorized under the 2021 infrastructure law, helps guide intercity passenger rail development throughout the country. Step 3 enables the project to begin preliminary engineering and environmental work, some of which has been done. According to LeCody, Amtrak is conducting \u201cvery extensive conversations with everyone along this route, from North Texas down to Galveston.\u201d\n\nHigh-speed rail projects in the United States Projects at least partially funded for planning, design, engineering and/or construction.\n\nFour more projects in planning around the country\n\nAmtrak received a federal grant of up to $500,000 to help plan the Texas Central project. Four other projects also received up to $500,000 planning grants last year under the FRA\u2019s Corridor Identification and Development Program:\n\nThe North Central Texas Council of Governments is proposing a high-speed rail line between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, a short ride that would allow residents west of Dallas to easily connect with the proposed Texas Central line to Houston.\n\nIn California, the High Desert Corridor project seeks to link the future Brightline West line to the California High-Speed Rail Authority\u2019s San Francisco-LA line in Southern California. It also has state and local funding.\n\nThe states of Washington and Oregon, along with the Canadian province of British Columbia, are exploring high-speed rail connecting Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation is spearheading a plan to build high-speed rail connecting Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nCongress has granted appropriations for two other projects: a proposed Atlanta to Chattanooga, Tennessee, line, led by the Tennessee Department of Transportation in conjunction with the Georgia DOT, and an Atlanta-Savannah, Georgia, line.\n\nSome advocates envision a national network of high-speed rail. \u201cA true high-speed rail network would be enormously beneficial for our economy and for our climate,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cIt would even be beneficial for our roads because it would reduce the congestion on them.\u201d\n\nBut funds for these ambitious projects can be hard to come by, and U.S. political leaders\u2019 attitude toward high-speed rail could determine their future.", "source_domain": "www.smartcitiesdive.com", "article_id": "b522fe6f-c450-4faf-a427-624cf3f6d5a1", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

These developments represent a significant leap forward in the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure, offering faster, more sustainable alternatives to car travel and addressing the growing demand for efficient, eco-friendly transit options. As these states work to modernize and expand their rail routes, travelers can expect improved connectivity, reduced travel times, and enhanced regional access, marking a new era for rail travel in the U.S.\n\n1. California: Brightline West and Amtrak\u2019s High-Speed Rail Projects\n\nBrightline West (Southern California to Las Vegas)\n\nOne of the most anticipated rail projects set to launch in 2025 is Brightline West, a high-speed rail service that will connect Southern California to Las Vegas, cutting down travel time between the two cities to just over two hours. The service will be capable of reaching speeds up to 200 mph, making it one of the fastest rail lines in the U.S. Brightline West aims to be a cleaner, faster, and more efficient alternative to the congested I-15 highway, which is a major route connecting these two popular destinations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis high-speed rail will be a game-changer for travelers who want to avoid long car journeys or flights. Brightline West is expected to attract both leisure and business travelers, and its efficiency will make it a popular choice for those traveling to Las Vegas, especially during peak seasons.\n\nImpact on the Travel Industry :\n\nThe launch of Brightline West will impact air travel, offering a comfortable and faster alternative to flying between Southern California and Las Vegas. Additionally, it will create new opportunities for tourism-related businesses, such as hotels and restaurants, particularly in areas near rail stations.\n\n: The launch of Brightline West will impact air travel, offering a comfortable and faster alternative to flying between Southern California and Las Vegas. Additionally, it will create new opportunities for tourism-related businesses, such as hotels and restaurants, particularly in areas near rail stations. Economic Implications:\n\nThe service is expected to boost local economies in both California and Nevada. As travel between these two regions becomes quicker, business trips, tourism, and conventions are likely to see an increase. This is also expected to contribute to a reduction in road congestion, which has long been a major concern.\n\nCalifornia High-Speed Rail (Amtrak Expansion)\n\nWhile Brightline West offers a rapid connection between California and Nevada, Amtrak\u2019s California High-Speed Rail project is focused on enhancing connectivity within California itself. California\u2019s high-speed rail aims to provide a seamless journey between major cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, with plans to connect to the Central Valley in the future.\n\nAmtrak\u2019s expansion is a long-term project that will continue to develop in phases. The high-speed trains will be capable of reaching speeds exceeding 200 mph, offering a significantly faster alternative to driving or taking flights within California. The rail line is also expected to provide sustainable options for eco-conscious travelers, as trains emit fewer carbon emissions compared to cars and planes.\n\nImpact on the Travel Industry :\n\nThis expansion is expected to reduce flight traffic between California\u2019s major cities, providing a much-needed alternative for travelers. For businesses and individuals who regularly commute between California\u2019s major urban areas, the rail line will offer a more efficient and environmentally friendly option.\n\n: This expansion is expected to reduce flight traffic between California\u2019s major cities, providing a much-needed alternative for travelers. For businesses and individuals who regularly commute between California\u2019s major urban areas, the rail line will offer a more efficient and environmentally friendly option. Environmental Impact:\n\nThe environmental impact of California\u2019s high-speed rail project is particularly important, as the state pushes toward sustainability. The new rail lines will contribute to California\u2019s green energy initiatives by reducing the state\u2019s overall carbon footprint and promoting greener travel alternatives.\n\n2. Texas: Houston to Dallas High-Speed Rail\n\nThe proposed Houston to Dallas High-Speed Rail project is one of the most ambitious transportation initiatives in Texas. The line is designed to dramatically reduce the travel time between these two cities, currently around four hours by car, to approximately 90 minutes. While the project is still facing some local opposition, particularly from Waller County officials, it is expected to bring significant benefits to the state\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe rail line would serve as a major boost to economic activity, particularly in the energy-rich region around Houston and Dallas.

Lester, Editor-in-Chief\nThe Shinkansen, or Japanese bullet train, pulls into a station in Japan. This is the type of train proposed for the Texas Central.\nDavid C. Lester\n\nHOUSTON \u2013\u2013 The Texas state legislature has prepared a bill that would prevent the construction of high-speed rail service between Houston and Dallas from interfering with or altering any existing roads or highways, making routing of the proposed service much more difficult.\n\nHouston Public Media has reported that State House Bill 1402 was presented and debated this week by Texas House Subcommittee on Transportation Funding and was written by state Rep. Cody Harris of East Texas (R-District 8). This bill would make it illegal to use local or state funding to make any changes to roadways during the construction of the proposed high-speed rail line between Houston and Dallas, which are the two largest cities in Texas.\n\nDuring the past ten years, proponents have tried to move a 240-mile high-speed rail project between the cities forward, but with virtually no progress. The train, fashioned after the Japanese Bullet Train Shinkansen, would travel between Houston and Dallas in 90 minutes.\n\nHarris said \u201cTexas Central [the company promoting the line] wants to skirt paying local property taxes that were owed but use local property tax dollars to pay for their project. Bill 1402 prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in any form from the state to local level from being used to pay for the alteration of the roadway related to the construction of a high-speed rail project.\u201d\n\nWaller County Judge Trey Duhon, who has been a long-time opponent of the rail project, said \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here to the Capitol every session since 2015 to share my concerns about the proposed high-speed rail project. \u201cHB1402 by Chairman Harris will protect state money and ensure that public funds throughout the state are safeguarded from being wasted on a washed up, overhyped, underfunded, bait and switch, high-speed rail project.\u201d\n\nDuhon further argued that \u201cIn the future, if a high-speed rail company wants to create a plan that addresses the failures of this project, this bill will keep rogue public entities from accepting and spending funds on projects that are outside of their jurisdiction, as well as ensure that counties like mine aren\u2019t compelled to pay for rerouting of roads that we need exactly where they are.\u201d\n\nPeter LeCody, who is president of Texas Rail Advocates, a nonprofit group that supports passenger railroading said the bill \u201cnarrowly defines it [the rule] to a particular mode of transportation \u2013\u2013 intercity high-speed rail service that is reasonably expected to reach speeds of at least 110 miles per hour. That doesn\u2019t give us a level playing feel with other forms of transportation. This bill would cripple that ability to advance any high-speed rail project.\u201d\n\nA Brightline higher-speed train pulling out of West Palm Beach Station, headed to Miami. Brightline has focused on leveraging and supporting real estate development along its lines. Brightline is a privately held company. (Photo by David C. Lester)\n\nThe privately held higher-speed rail company Brightline, which provides service between Miami and Orlando in Florida, is working on an extension to Tampa, and is building the Brightline West line, essentially from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, has made real estate development a key part of the success it\u2019s has enjoyed during the past few years.\n\nHowever, supporters of the Texas bill say that the prospect of the Texas Central route has thwarted real estate development projects. One company, Delta Tory, is planning a development near Hockley, northwest of Houston. William Papadopoulos, who is with Delta Tory, said \u201cThis imaginary line on published maps has prevented us from developing our 993-acre property, where we aim to create jobs within a first-class business part to onshore industry and to grow the regional and state tax base. We also seek to develop affordable housing. Unfortunately, potential homeowners and corporations consider the rail line to be a nuisance.\u201d\n\nRT&S will continue to follow this story.\n\nTags: high-speed rail, higher-speed rail, passenger rail, real estate development, Texas Central\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\nFederal Railroad Administration Faces Lawsuit from California Over CHSRA Funding\nU.S. DOT Scraps Funding for California High Speed Rail Project\nCHSRA Completes Avenue 56 Grade Separation\nWATCH: CHSRA Releases Video of Spring 2025 Progress\nCHSRA Completes Belmont Avenue and Central Avenue Grade Separation Projects\n\nRail Resources\nDigital Edition\nNewsletters\nTrack Buyers Guide\nJob Board\nConferences\nPodcasts\nIndustry Events\nEOI/RFP/RFQ Notices\nRT&S Annual Awards\nBooks & Training\n\nPopular Articles\nCoastal Rail Resiliency Study Seeks To Refine Concepts\nMDOT MTA Purple Line Project Is 80% Complete\nBalfour Beatty Prequalified for Metrolink\u2019s SCORE Program\nGetting Closer to a Merger Deal?

They said they wanted his expertise on how federal health programs could improve care for people with substance use disorders.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the email, I forwarded it to colleagues, and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is real.\u2019 I have published some on Medicaid policy as it relates to treatment for opioid use disorder, and I actively practice in this area. But I\u2019m very junior, and so I literally thought it was a joke,\u201d Christine says. \u201cOne of my mentors said, \u2018That looks real. You should respond.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSoon it got even more real. A Zoom meeting with the congressional staffers to discuss the issue was followed by an invitation to come to Washington, D.C., to testify before a Senate subcommittee.\n\n\u201cI asked them directly, \u2018Why me?\u2019 And they were very supportive. They told me they liked the way I was able to draw connections between the very big policy issues and the way they directly impact care for my patients. They appreciated having clinical insights into how policy influences practice.\u201d\n\nEight days to prepare\n\nChristine, an assistant professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine, found himself sitting before a panel of senators recently, testifying with other experts at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Health Care titled \u201cClosing Gaps in the Care Continuum: Opportunities to Improve Substance Use Disorder Care in the Federal Health Programs.\u201d Among the senators at the hearing that day was U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado.\n\n\u2192 Video: Watch the U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing on substance use disorder\n\nChristine had only eight days to prepare his written and oral testimony after getting the invitation. \u201cI had to put everything else on hold,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is my full-time job for the next week.\u201d\n\nDespite his junior status, Christine brought extensive research and clinical experience with him to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHe is a board-certified addiction medicine specialist who practices at Denver Health\u2019s Sam Sandos Westside Family Health Center, where he works as part of a multidisciplinary team to provide comprehensive treatment for individuals with substance use disorders. His research focuses on evaluating health and social policies that affect the availability of high-quality care for people with substance use disorders, particularly for those enrolled in Medicaid and other safety-net programs. He also delves into testing innovative approaches to improve addiction care.\n\nChristine says he is passionate about researching and promoting policies that improve health care equity and outcomes for substance use disorder patients. In April he co-authored an opinion column in The Colorado Sun, an online news outlet, on how proposed federal legislation would help rural Coloradans get greater access to opioid addiction treatment.\n\nPaul Christine, MD, PhD, testifies before the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Health Care in Washington, D.C. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Senate.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe Senate hearing was called amid a serious and growing crisis. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, nearly 108,000 people in the United States died from drug-involved overdoses in 2022, twice as many as in 2015. Of those deaths, 74,000 involved synthetic opioids other than methadone, primarily fentanyl. Opioid use disorder -- chronic use of opioids causing clinically significant distress or impairment \u2013 affects more than 2 million Americans.\n\nChristine says there are a couple of key points that he hoped the senators took away from his testimony.\n\n\u201cOne is that we should be keeping federal insurance barriers to treatment for addiction as low as possible. There are policies in place within Medicaid and Medicare that put up barriers where they don\u2019t need to be. I talked about prior authorization policies for medications for opioid use disorder. Those policies continue to be enforced in a lot of states, particularly in Medicaid managed care programs, and it\u2019s directly in the federal government\u2019s ability to say, \u2018OK, no more of this.\u2019 In fact, Medicare has already done that.\u201d\n\nPaying for what works\n\nThe second key takeaway in his testimony, he says, \u201cis paying for what works. Addiction treatment by its nature is very collaborative and multidisciplinary, and yet a small fraction of what we do is actually reimbursable, and many of the programs that we know work well are entirely grant funded, which is temporary. Take, for instance, peer support services, where people who are in recovery from drug use help current patients navigate the treatment system and social services. We know that there are really effective models of this. And yet, most state Medicaid programs won\u2019t pay for that. And that leaves a lot of patients in the lurch.\u201d\n\nIn his testimony, he cited contingency management for stimulant use disorder as another example of paying for what works. Contingency management is \u201ca structured rewards program for keeping people engaged in treatment. But there are federal limits on how much we can spend that are far below what published research shows are effective levels.\u201d\n\n\u2192 Studying the Connection Between Empathy and Substance Use in Adolescents\n\nOverall, he says, \u201cthere needs to be a standardized process through the federal health programs to evaluate the evidence, figure out what works well, and then pay for it.\u201d\n\nChristine says he felt the senators were \u201cvery receptive\u201d to his message at the hearing. He noted that his invitation to testify came from staffers from the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, a Democrat, and its ranking Republican, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana.\n\n\u201cFortunately, around the issues of substance use, there is a decent amount of bipartisanship. People recognize that the overdose crisis is a major issue. It doesn't matter if you're in a right-leaning or left-leaning state. This is impacting everybody, and they seemed to genuinely want to come up with some solutions.\u201d\n\nPhoto at top: Paul Christine, MD, PhD (right) testifies before the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Health Care in Washington, D.C.

{"url": "https://hcahealthcaretoday.com/2023/05/22/how-hca-healthcare-is-working-to-prevent-treat-and-beat-stroke/", "title": "How HCA Healthcare is working to prevent, treat and beat stroke", "published_at": "2023-05-22T00:00:00", "full_text": "Did you know someone in the U.S. has a stroke every 40 seconds? Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States and is a major cause of serious disability for adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is also preventable and treatable.\n\nSo, what exactly is a stroke? A stroke occurs when part of the brain is cut off from blood and oxygen due to a blood clot or broken blood vessel. In just minutes, strokes can cause lasting brain damage, and delayed treatment increases the risk of permanent disability and death. Knowledge of stroke risk factors and symptoms is crucial to reducing the likelihood of and improving the outcome of a stroke.\n\nThe American Heart Association\u2019s Getting to the Heart of Stroke\u2122 initiative, developed in conjunction with HCA Healthcare \u2014 our broader healthcare network \u2014 and the HCA Healthcare Foundation, focuses on preventing, treating and beating stroke by:\n\nProviding nationwide consumer and healthcare professional education.\n\nDeepening collaboration between neurology and cardiology.\n\nEquitably empowering communities to improve health outcomes.\n\nWith individualized health education efforts in 15 local communities across the U.S., the initiative highlights the powerful connection between heart and brain health.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, but the reverse is also true: problems with the heart, including AFib, are well-documented as major stroke risk factors,\u201d says Nancy Brown, chief executive officer, American Heart Association. \u201cTo effectively combat stroke, we need to work together and elevate the heart-brain connection among health care professionals, while simultaneously addressing health disparities and resource gaps in our communities. We are not a one-size-fits-all nation, and neither is the most successful approach to public health.\u201d\n\nKnow your risk\n\nStroke prevention starts with knowing the risk factors that increase the likelihood of having a stroke. Identifying the underlying cause of a stroke is also crucial to preventing subsequent strokes. Common risk factors include obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, alcohol or drug abuse, or heart disease. If you have any of these risk factors, it is important to discuss them with your doctor to manage and reduce your chance of stroke.\n\nFor example, patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation are up to five times more likely to experience a stroke. The American Heart Association\u2019s patient support network, MyAFibExperience, empowers individuals to better understand and manage their stroke risk.\n\nAs part of the Getting to the Heart of StrokeTM initiative, the American Heart Association will work alongside the HCA Healthcare Foundation and HCA Healthcare to implement community education as well as professional education focused on identifying stroke risk factors projected through the lens of equitable health for all.\n\nWorking closely with thought leaders in healthcare, including those from HCA Healthcare, the American Heart Association will also develop accredited education programming that will be available to all healthcare professionals, and a specific learning collaborative with 10 HCA Healthcare facilities focused on continuously improving the quality of care.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be collaborating with the American Heart Association,\u201d says Dr. Steven Manoukian, HCA Healthcare senior vice president and Fellow of the American Heart Association. \u201cWithin both organizations, we recognize that increased education and connectivity between our neurology and cardiology health care teams, patients and communities are integral to reducing the devastation of stroke, determining its underlying cardiac causes, such as AFib and structural heart disease, and preventing future strokes. Through this unique and multi-faceted initiative with the AHA, everyone will become better at Getting to the Heart of Stroke.\u201d\n\nKnow the signs\n\nWhen a stroke occurs, getting treatment fast is crucial to decreasing the long-lasting effects of stroke. The signs of a stroke can be thought of with the acronym, BE FAST. Here are the symptoms that could mean you or your loved one is having a stroke:\n\nBalance or the inability to maintain coordination\n\nEyes or the inability to see out of one or both\n\nFace that is drooping on one side\n\nArms or the inability to raise one or both\n\nSpeech or the inability to repeat a simple sentence\n\nAnd if you or someone around you is experiencing the symptoms above, it is\n\nTime to call 911 and seek emergency care.\n\nHCA Healthcare has a long history of prioritizing and working to continually improve patient safety. This includes reducing our average door-to-needle time to 34 minutes, which is faster than the national standard for stroke care.\n\nShare with your community\n\nIn order to beat stroke, we must decrease stroke for every member of our communities. HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are dedicated to advancing health equity and bettering stroke care in all patient subsets, including all races and ethnicities. Some patient subsets, such as Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations, face additional barriers to identifying and treating stroke risk factors, receiving thorough assessment and finding follow-up stroke care.\n\nGetting to the Heart of StrokeTM addresses health disparities like this through local health impact work and community education in areas including women\u2019s health, high blood pressure management, nutrition security and tobacco/vaping prevention.\n\nYou can make a difference in your community by sharing your knowledge of stroke care and prevention with others. By sharing the resources in this article, along with additional resources provided by the American Heart Association, American Stroke Association and the Getting to the Heart of StrokeTM initiative, with your family and friends who may be at risk for stroke, you can help save lives.\n\nInspiring stories of stroke survivors\n\nAcross HCA Healthcare, we hear countless stories from stroke patients and those who care for them. We know that stroke can happen to anyone at any time. This American Stroke Month, read four powerful stories of stroke survival and learn more about how to recognize stroke and what to do if stroke happens.\n\nFlorida mother shares her stroke story to ensure other young adults are aware of their risk\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Crystal Warp (right) and her mother (left).\n\nHCA Healthcare patient Crystal Warp is a 39-year-old mother of three who, after surviving and recovering from a stroke, is sharing her recent health scare to make sure other young adults are aware of their risk. Crystal\u2019s experience comes as doctors across the country are witnessing a concerning trend \u2013 adults under 50 are having more strokes than ever before.\n\nWhen Crystal was recently preparing to attend her weekly quilter\u2019s class, she began experiencing tingling and numbness in her leg, dizziness and a terrible headache. After witnessing Crystal\u2019s speech difficulty and body weakness, Crystal\u2019s mother, Kicha Padmore-Johnson, rushed her to HCA Florida Poinciana Hospital in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nOnce they arrived at the hospital, one of the nurses quickly noticed Crystal\u2019s stroke-like symptoms and rushed her back for an assessment, where doctors discovered a brain bleed. Crystal had suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage, or ICH stroke.\n\nCrystal spent several days in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit, followed by weeks at HCA Florida Osceola Hospital\u2019s onsite acute inpatient physical rehabilitation center, where she would regain the function of her hands and body with intensive physical and occupational therapy, including a comprehensive rehabilitation program specifically for post-stroke patients.\n\n\u201cThe loss of movement after stroke was overwhelming to me. The self-doubt and sadness that came from not being able to go home to my kids, not being able to be there for them like I was before, not being able to craft, which provides for my family \u2013 it was devastating,\u201d Crystal said.\n\n\u201cBut the nurses and therapists at the hospital were amazing and encouraged me every step of the way. To me, HCA Healthcare is family. I have a forever family in some of the people who took care of me. I\u2019m out of the hospital and they still check on me.\u201d Crystal Warp, HCA Healthcare stroke patient\n\nCrystal is nearly fully recovered more than a month after her stroke. She couldn\u2019t wait to create custom creations from her craft business for each HCA Healthcare colleague who cared for her as a thank you. She recently visited the team to show how she is now able to walk unassisted.\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Crystal Warp (middle) recently returned to HCA Florida Osceola Hospital to say thank you to her caregivers.\n\n\u201cIt is not lost on me that when I spend time with my family, play with my kids, and for the first time after my stroke, walk by myself, it is because a family of physicians, nurses, therapists and others that gave me my life back. For that, I am forever grateful.\u201d Crystal Warp, HCA Healthcare stroke patient\n\nTexas hospital honors \u2018miracle\u2019 stroke survivor\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Jeremy Simmons received care at HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest in Texas.\n\nA Houston stroke survivor\u2019s recovery is described as a \u201cmiracle\u201d by his loved ones and surgeon. Earlier this year, 42-year-old HCA Healthcare patient Jeremy Simmons collapsed and fell unconscious while at his home.\n\nJeremy was rushed to HCA Houston Healthcare North Cypress Hospital after his wife called 9-1-1. There, doctors discovered he had had a stroke, four brain aneurysms and excessive bleeding to the brain. Jeremy was then transported for advanced care to sister facility, HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest.\n\nIn a split second, the lives of Jeremy\u2019s entire family were turned upside down. His wife recalls the most challenging part was maintaining some sense of normalcy for their five-year-old daughter, who had to go 28 days without seeing her dad.\n\nAccording to Dr. Shamaelah Javed, a neuroendovascular surgeon at HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest, Jeremy\u2019s case was unique due to major bleeding occurring at his young age. She said he had a rare malformation affecting only 1 in 600,000 people, and 70% of patients in these cases don\u2019t even make it to the hospital.\n\n\u201c[Jeremy\u2019s recovery] is basically attributed to the kind of care that he got in the hospital along with the treatment we offered,\u201d Dr. Javed told the Houston Chronicle. \u201cThis is like a miracle because his chances of walking out of the hospital were very long.\u201d\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Jeremy Simmons hugs his daughter while recovering in the hospital.\n\nDr. Javed said the use of new devices and technology helped throughout the process. \u201cHe just came back to see me a couple of weeks ago and he\u2019s doing very well. He\u2019s recovered a lot. So, I think the new treatment modalities that we have has made a huge difference in his recovery.\u201d\n\nFamily members are also integral in the stroke care journey.

Get to the doctor immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd obviously, as anybody knows, you\u2019re your biggest advocate for yourself and your health. Talk as a family.

The 51-year-old credits both his co-worker at Volvo, Shavon Felder, and the care team at Trident Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina, with saving his life.\n\nOn December 21, 2022, Shavon noticed Nate\u2019s speech was slurred when he was talking to her at work. \u201cWhen he first said my name, it was slurred and I knew it wasn\u2019t right. So, I asked him to repeat it,\u201d explained Felder. \u201cI told him to look at me and noticed his face was looking funny. Then, he told me he thought he was dragging a leg. I said, \u2018Oh no, you\u2019re having a stroke\u2019.\u201d\n\nThey quickly called 9-1-1, and Nate was transported to Trident Medical Center for emergency stroke care. The South Carolina hospital was recently ranked among the top 100 Hospitals in America for stroke care in 2023.\n\nAfter receiving speech, occupational and physical therapy at Trident Medical Center\u2019s Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit, Nate\u2019s caregivers held a red carpet celebration to celebrate his recovery. Nate said, \u201cOnce your speech, eating and walking have been disturbed you will know how difficult it is to start over again. So, I say to anyone who is listening, don\u2019t take those things for granted. In a moment\u2019s notice, they can be taken from you.\u201d\n\nWalking down the red carpet at the hospital, Nate was able to thank Shavon and his care team, while also spreading smiles by bowing once he reached the end.

Investigators received a tip last month that she had an inappropriate relationship with a student while she was employed by the Poudre School District.\n\nAccording to police records obtained by CBS News Colorado, Poncelow first met the alleged victim while she was navigating high school. The two allegedly formed a relationship that started in the school counseling office, later progressing to an off-campus location.\n\nPolice say it was there that she then allegedly kissed and touched the girl in a sexual manner multiple times in the following years.\n\nThe alleged victim told police she was later invited to a second off-campus location with Poncelow, and there, she accused Poncelow of sexually assaulting her.\n\nShe told police she thought she was going to die following the alleged sexual assault.\n\nWhen asked if she was encouraged to hide the alleged abuse, the victim told police she had discussed that with Poncelow. She recalled Poncelow saying, \"if you tell anyone, I'll kill myself,\" the arrest report said.\n\nPolice said they learned through the course of the investigation that Poncelow expressed regret for her actions, allegedly telling the victim she was ashamed for falling in love with the girl.\n\nPolice claim Poncelow said to the victim, in part, \"our physical and sexual relationship was not okay.

The district has fully cooperated with law enforcement throughout the investigation.\"\n\nFort Collins Police also acknowledged that the school district has been cooperative with the investigation.\n\n\"The safety and well-being of our students are our highest priority.

However, under the Biden Administration, the company was granted federal funding to assist with the investment.\n\nDue to rising cost estimates, the Trump Administration has now withdrawn this federal support, citing the project\u2019s increasing reliance on taxpayer funding. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy stated that Amtrak supported the decision, noting that terminating the grant would allow the agency to prioritise improvements to existing services, with the freed-up funds redirected to other rail initiatives.\n\nThe ramifications of this decision were discussed in detail at Railway Interchange, held in Indianapolis 20-22 May 2025. During a panel discussion hosted by RSI, industry leaders considered the future of the Texas project, as well as the wider implications for rail investment across the US.\n\nThe Future of High-Speed Rail in Texas\n\nWhile the withdrawal of funding typically signals a setback, Robert Pearsall, Partnership Director at the US High Speed Rail Association (USHSR), argued that the decision could benefit the project in the long run.\n\nPearsall noted that Amtrak has limited experience in high-speed rail, and the current administration is not supportive of Amtrak-led efforts in this space. Therefore, removing Amtrak\u2019s involvement may ultimately pave the way for a successful private sector-led development.\n\nIndeed, Amtrak\u2019s exit may clear the path for private equity firms to take the lead\u2014an approach already exemplified by the Brightline West project, which is largely funded by Fortress Investment Group. This model would better align with the administration\u2019s preferences and could consequently set the project up for more long-term success.\n\nIn support of this argument, Pearsall emphasised the significance of For Worth-based Kleinheinz Capital Partners acquiring the remaining 440 million USD of Japanese investment in the Texas Central high-speed rail project. This buyout made Kleinheinz the primary owner of the proposed Dallas-to-Houston line, which plans to utilise Japanese Shinkansen technology.\n\nPearsall sees this as a significant turning point for the project, suggesting that Kleinheinz is now poised to inject billions in private equity into the project, pending state-level approvals.\n\nConsequently, with Amtrak out and private capital ready to be deployed, the project may have a clearer path forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Amtrak\u2019s reasons for supporting the project remain, including high demand, good-sized population centres, limited stops, enclosed tracks, modern infrastructure, limited curves and simple topography. As a result, Pearsall asserted that Texas is well-positioned to succeed with a high-speed rail corridor, and suggested that a model driven by private equity could help provide a blueprint for the rest of the country.\n\nShifts in Funding Policies\n\nWhen considering the broader implications of the US DOT\u2019s decision to terminate the grant, Husein Cumber, Senior Advisor at Brightline Holdings, emphasised that it sends a clear signal to the rail industry. Cumber argued that the current administration is setting an expectation that passenger rail projects must present a complete and credible financial plan before receiving federal support.\n\nHusein Cumber stated: The signal that the administration is sending is: if you don't have a complete financial plan for your project, they're not going to incrementally fund it.\n\nWith an estimated 40 billion USD project cost and an 80 million USD federal grant request, Cumber highlighted a lack of clarity as to where the remaining 39.9 billion USD would be sourced from.\n\nThis resulting perspective arguably points to the administration\u2019s growing impatience with partial funding strategies and speculative project planning. Rather than backing ambitious rail ventures with limited upfront clarity, Washington appears to be shifting towards a model that prioritises financial certainty and fully scoped investment frameworks.\n\nThe Impact on the Rail Industry\n\nHowever, although US DOT\u2019s decision may send a clear signal, Benji Schwartz, Director of Government Affairs and Advocacy at APTA noted that \u201cnothing happens in a vacuum,\u201d and the overall messaging coming out of Washington has been confusing to stakeholders. Schwartz pointed to examples such as post-award changes to grant agreements and blanket funding freezes that were implemented in the early days of the administration.\n\nAs a result, Schwartz cautioned that even if the withdrawal of funding from the Texas high-speed rail project ultimately proves beneficial, it risks sending a destabilising message. This atmosphere of unpredictability, he argued, is particularly harmful to large-scale infrastructure projects that rely on long-term planning and investment certainty. Delays, rising costs, and weakened stakeholder confidence could consequently follow.\n\nIn turn, this uncertainty may deter private investment\u2014the very model the administration appears to favour. Indeed, Greg Regan, President at the Transportation Trades Department (TTD), AFL-CIO, noted that private investments are spurred by stable federal investments that encourage buy-ins. Without that foundation, industry confidence may falter.\n\nThe Outlook for US High-Speed Rail\n\nDespite this caution, Regan acknowledged that uncertainty will likely reduce once Brightline West demonstrates what is possible and launches its first high-speed services. Currently, the US does not have a proof of concept for true high-speed rail, which arguably remains a critical barrier to both public and private sector confidence.\n\nRegan argued: We need to get the first trains running to show people what is possible. Once you show people what is possible, then that 40 billion dollars becomes a whole lot more achievable because there's less risk.\n\nRegan further emphasised this point, stressing that a proof of concept could address one of the industry\u2019s biggest financial obstacles: the cost of debt.\n\nHe cited the example of Brightline Florida, which initially issued debt at steep costs due to the perceived risk of being a first mover. Only after the line entered operation and reduced construction risk did it become possible to refinance at more favourable rates. This suggests that once a project proves itself, borrowing becomes cheaper, making large-scale capital stacks feasible.\n\nConsequently, focus is now likely to remain fixed on Brightline West, which is set to deliver the country\u2019s first operational high-speed rail service. Industry stakeholders hope it will serve as the proof of concept needed to unlock future investment, but until then, uncertainty around federal commitments may continue to complicate long-term planning, presenting a roadblock for the future of high-speed rail in Texas.\n\n\u00a9 Brightline\n\nFor additional insights for Railway Interchange, read: Can US Rail Survive Trump\u2019s Second Term?\n\nTags", "source_domain": "railway-news.com", "article_id": "75c9bd54-ad1c-42fe-b5d9-2dfbd39ceead", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Thanks to a locally owned software company, as well as a local nonprofit, he was able to author and finish his first book with assistance from engineer Gaylon Ponder, the owner of a Bremen-based tech company known as Words+.\n\nWords+ makes the software Ragsdale used to write Fishing for Fin, and, as Ponder notes, it\u2019s the 2024-updated version of the very same software that famed theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking used, while afflicted with ALS, to write his breakthrough bestselling cosmology book A Brief History of Time.\n\nThrough AAC Works, Org, the local nonprofit Ponder founded \u201cto assist people who are speech and mobility impaired [to] find ongoing jobs that lead to successful vocational careers,\u201d Ponder has been assisting Ragsdale using the internet throughout the young author\u2019s book-writing journey, all while using Words+ \u2014 the very software company Ponder owns \u2014 as the go-to way for Ragsdale to put his ideas to digital paper.\n\nRather than remaining content with a life that relegates him to inactivity, Ragsdale has taken advantage of the proactive, can-do approach to disability that AAC Works, Org was created to foster.\n\nEmail newsletter signup\n\nPonder\u2019s goal with the outreach is \u201cto give people who don\u2019t have the same physical abilities as the rest of us the ability to still be functional assets to society \u2014 rather than accept what society typically expects for them,\u201d explains fellow children\u2019s author Elena Caudle, the local friend whom Ponder sought out for book-writing advice after Ragsdale expressed an interest in writing a story of his own.\n\nWith copies of his now-published book in tow, Ragsdale will be the author of the hour at his Nov. 8 book signing at Karma\u2019s.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the South Carolina Daily Gazette.\n\nAttorneys general from six states, including Colorado, say they\u2019re demanding accountability from WeChat, a Chinese messaging and payment platform being used by fentanyl traffickers.\n\nThe bipartisan group is giving WeChat, what\u2019s become known as a super app, a month to detail what steps it\u2019s taking, if any, to combat its use as a money launderer for the international drug trade.\n\nI have worked tirelessly to address the opioid crisis by using every tool we can to save lives, including cracking down on the distribution of fentanyl,\u201d Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general of Colorado, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I fought for legislation in Colorado, based on a report from our office, to ensure that online platforms have a greater responsibility to police their platforms and cooperate with law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need answers; we need them now,\u201d Republican Alan Wilson, South Carolina\u2019s attorney general since 2011, said at a news conference Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nStanding beside him was North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nA letter dated Monday instructs WeChat to send answers by June 11 to the attorneys general in North Carolina and New Jersey, two states where \u201cknowingly facilitating, or aiding and abetting, money laundering\u201d is a crime.\n\n\u201cWeChat\u2019s contribution to the devastating fentanyl crisis endangers the life and health of our people,\u201d they wrote in the letter, also signed by attorneys general from Mississippi and New Hampshire.\n\nIf WeChat fails to respond, lawsuits from the states\u2019 chief prosecutors could follow, as well as advocacy for laws and regulations, Wilson and Jakson said.\n\nWeChat is one of the world\u2019s most popular messaging apps with more than a billion users globally, including a million-plus in the United States. The app created by the company Tencent allows encrypted messaging and payments to be made within it \u2014 two features that have made it incredibly popular for criminal activity, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe app has been linked to major drug operations.\n\nIn October 2023, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced indictments against eight Chinese companies and 12 people in a bust dubbed Operation Chem Capture. They were accused of importing the chemicals used to make fentanyl \u2014 called fentanyl precursors \u2014 as well as other drugs such as xylazine that are mixed with fentanyl to increase cartels\u2019 profits.\n\nThe multi-agency operation seized enough synthetic chemicals to make more than 48 million potentially lethal doses, the agency\u2019s administrator, Anne Milgram, said in a statement submitted to the U.S. House last May.\n\n\u201cOperation Chem Capture once again showed that these synthetic chemicals are cheap \u2014 a deadly dose costs mere cents \u2014 and sold online on public websites and through encrypted applications like WhatsApp, WeChat, and Wickr,\u201d the statement read.\n\nJackson illustrated a three-step process for how Chinese brokers and drug cartels use WeChat to partner for fentanyl dealing.\n\nChinese companies sell the chemical ingredients to the cartels, who make the fentanyl. The drug is then smuggled into the country and sold for cash. In the final step, the cash is given to Chinese brokers who use WeChat to give the money back to the cartel, he said.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that we are talking about billions of dollars per year,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nThe joint letter, which uses Jackson\u2019s letterhead, is addressed to \u201cwhom it may concern\u201d at WeChat\u2019s registered agent in Delaware.\n\nPeople \u201care using the internet to evolve how they launder money, to evolve how they evade detection by law enforcement, to evolve how they promote this type of illicit activity,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo, we have to evolve with them.\u201d\n\nWilson told reporters the fentanyl epidemic is the top issue that keeps him up at night.\n\nWeChat\u2019s alleged role in crimes\n\nIn 2023, Weiser\u2019s office issued a report on social media and the sale of illegal drugs, including fentanyl. The report included several recommendations. For example, it called for new state legislation that would require social media companies to disclose their policies on drug activity and to be more transparent about their enforcement activities, more law enforcement resources, and a new federal agency to oversee social media platforms.\n\nIn South Carolina, overdose deaths have soared from 613 in 2013 to 2,296 in 2022, according to the most recent statistics from the state Department of Public Health. That represents a near-quadrupling over that decade.\n\nFentanyl accounted for more than 70% of those 2022 deaths, or 1,660 overdoses, representing a near-quadrupling over just five years, according to the 2024 report.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows someone, either personally or within one or two degrees of separation, where a family has lost a young person or someone has died as an overdose as a result of the illicit fentanyl trafficking going on in our respective states,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nLast month, three men \u2014 two from Sumter and one from Georgia \u2014 were indicted in South Carolina in what federal prosecutors called one of the largest international, drug-related money laundering operations the Palmetto State\u2019s ever seen.\n\nThey\u2019re accused by the U.S. Department of Justice of laundering more than $30 million in the trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs, as well as taking cash from two Mexican cartels and using it to purchase and ship electronics to Hong Kong, China and the United Arab Emirates to be sold for profit.\n\nWeChat played a crucial role in the alleged criminal dealings, Wilson\u2019s office noted in a news release Monday.\n\n\u201cWeChat has become a digital safe haven for fentanyl traffickers and money launderers, and they know it,\u201d said Wilson.\n\nSC Daily Gazette is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

{"url": "https://coloradosun.com/2020/03/16/mobile-rvs-for-opioid-treatment/", "title": "", "published_at": "2020-03-16T00:00:00", "full_text": "STEAMBOAT SPRINGS \u2014 The RV will hit the road for a different northwest Colorado town each day, carrying urine toxicology tests, opioid-overdose antidotes, a counselor and a nurse.\n\nSundays at the Mercantile in Hayden. Wednesdays at the Safeway in Fraser. Thursdays at the City Market in Granby.\n\nThe rig is one of six that soon will travel throughout rural Colorado, an effort to bring opioid-addiction treatment to people who have none where they live.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring it to the frontier towns,\u201d said Nancy Smith Beste, executive director of Mountain Medical Road to Recovery, the Steamboat addiction treatment clinic that will operate the RV for the northwest region. Other stops on its route will include Kremmling and Oak Creek.\n\nThree of Colorado\u2019s six RVs already are on the highway, parking in small towns in the northeast corner of the state, the southeast and the San Luis Valley. The other three are still under construction to turn the vehicles into mobile medical clinics, with bathrooms to collect urine samples, a nurse\u2019s station and a private room for counseling sessions. Each will travel hundreds of miles per week.\n\nThe goal is that each of the six vehicles eventually will see at least 50 patients per week, providing medication-assisted treatment for those who are addicted to heroin or prescription opioids. Visits are by appointment or walk-in, and staff have been spreading the word at medical clinics, hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe towns were chosen by the state Office of Behavioral Health after officials reviewed data on overdose deaths and maps showing the areas of the state that have no clinics or doctors who prescribe medication-assisted treatment. The medicine to treat opioid addiction, buprenorphine, is a synthetic opioid used to eliminate withdrawal symptoms and has a low risk of overdose. It comes in pills, a patch or injection.\n\nUnlike methadone, which is dispensed at clinics strictly regulated by federal law, buprenorphine is available through prescription from physicians. The number of providers in Colorado willing to write those prescriptions has grown to nearly 1,800 in recent years, but stigma and prejudice about the people who seek the drug \u2014 sold under the brand name Suboxone \u2014 have prevented widespread access, said Robert Werthwein, director of the state Office of Behavioral Health.\n\nNeedles from heroin-users are collected in bins at the Harm Reduction Action Center in Capitol Hill. (Marvin Anani, Special to The Colorado Sun)\n\nThe six RVs are funded through a $6.7 million grant to Colorado from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which has awarded the state more than $45 million since 2017 for opioid addiction treatment and prevention. The funds have purchased almost 42,000 overdose kits that include naloxone, which can reverse the effects of an overdose, and were spent opening clinics, training doctors to prescribe buprenorphine and providing the medication in 16 county jails.\n\nThe idea for the traveling RVs came after Werthwein heard about a similar effort in New York while attending a conference two years ago. Besides helping people right away, a longer-term goal of the mobile units is to show local physicians how many people in their community need medication-assisted treatment \u2014 and spurring them to start prescribing the drugs.\n\n\u201cThere are some providers that are not aware that there is need in the community,\u201d Werthwein said, noting opioid addiction is a \u201cpretty widespread disease that covers a lot of individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are sicker than dogs\u201d\n\nWhen Beste, of Mountain Medical Road to Recovery, moved from the Denver area to Steamboat in 2017 to open the town\u2019s first medication-assisted treatment center, she didn\u2019t quite feel welcomed. \u201cThere was a lot of stigma when we got here, people saying it was trading one drug for another,\u201d she said, meaning locals did not see the benefit of prescribing synthetic opioids to people who were trying to stay off heroin. \u201cThey were really hesitant.\u201d\n\nSince then, Mountain Medical has \u201cinducted\u201d 160 clients into medication-assisted treatment. \u201cIt might not sound like a lot, but every time we say, \u2018We saved another life,\u2019\u201d Beste said.\n\nThe Mountain Medical clinic opened in Routt County, one of the Colorado counties hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, thanks to a state grant. Clients include those who are homeless and destitute, as well as those who started with prescription opioids after getting injured skiing or cycling, and later turned to heroin, Beste said.\n\n\u201cWe have people who come in that nobody knew they were using heroin,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018It\u2019s taking all my money and my wife doesn\u2019t know.\u2019 You can\u2019t tell. Most of the time you cannot even tell unless you really look at their pupils. And if they don\u2019t use, they are just sicker than dogs.\u201d\n\nA few clients drive from far-flung towns like Hayden, Oak Creek and even Winter Park, to seek help for their addiction. Sometimes they hitchhike to get there. And sometimes they stop coming because it\u2019s easier to buy heroin where they live, Beste said.\n\nEven though the clinic has yet to get its RV, staff began setting up weekly pop-up clinics in rural towns in November.\n\nBeste, who helped one of her sons and a stepson through treatment for heroin addiction before becoming a certified addiction counselor, couldn\u2019t quit thinking about people in rural Colorado who needed help \u2014 \u201cpeople who have lost their kids and are now about to suddenly feel healthy and well and not have to go out and search for heroin or alcohol,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who had given up.\u201d\n\nRead more health stories from The Colorado Sun\n\n\u201cUrgent care for addiction\u201d\n\nEach RV will have a nurse, an addiction counselor and a peer coach who is in recovery from addiction. The rigs \u2014 with satellite capacity \u2014 will use telehealth to connect a patient with a doctor who can write prescriptions.\n\nFront Range Clinic, which opened about five years ago in Fort Collins and now has 19 clinics from northern Colorado to Grand Junction and in Farmington, New Mexico, will operate three of the six RVs.\n\nOne is already traveling all the way to Julesburg in the northeast corner of the state, with weekly stops in Sterling, Limon, Burlington, Holyoke and Sedgwick. Another sets up in parking lots in La Junta, Las Animas, Walsenburg, Springfield and Trinidad. And a third, coming-soon RV will head south from Colorado Springs to the mountain town of Westcliffe, plus Woodland Park, Fairplay, Buena Vista and Bailey.\n\nThree Front Range Clinic staff members travel by RV to visit patients seeking treatment for opioid addiction, stopping in a different town each day of the week from Julesburg to Burlington. From left, they are counselor Nicky Mclean, nurse Christi Couron and peer specialist Tonja Jimenez. (Provided by Front Range Clinic)\n\nFront Range Clinic also has 15 pop-up clinics \u2014 including in homeless shelters and needle-exchange programs, said Dr. Clark McCoy, president of the clinic. He views all of the clinics \u2014 the buildings, the pop-ups and the RVs \u2014 as \u201curgent care for addiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur mission is to get evidence-based addiction treatment to underserved populations,\u201d he said, noting that all the clinics take Medicaid, private insurance and clients with no insurance. \u201cOur model is low-barrier, high-access.\u201d\n\nStaff in pop-up clinics have been telling people for months to spread the word about the RVs, and while some towns turn out only a handful of patients, others have kept staff busy. About 70% of Front Range\u2019s patients addicted to opioids were using heroin, compared with 30% prescription opioids, he said. A growing number are also using fentanyl, he said.\n\n\u201cWe come to them\u201d\n\nTonja Jimenez, a peer specialist who works in the RV that starts in Greeley each morning and heads east toward Kansas, began using meth, including intravenously, in 2010. Her ex-husband kicked her out when he found a meth pipe in their house, which sent her further into drug use and living in motels.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2012, after she had been arrested and found meth within 36 hours of posting bond, that she realized she was addicted.\n\n\u201cIt scared me,\u201d she recalled. Jimenez turned herself into jail and waited for placement in a treatment clinic in Greeley.\n\nAfter treatment, she started life over again \u2014 got a job at a butcher shop, rented a room in an apartment, reestablished a relationship with her two kids, and earned a degree in psychology from the University of Northern Colorado.\n\nNow she counsels people who come to the mobile clinic. One woman showed up sick from withdrawals, which heroin-users describe like the worst flu \u2014 \u201cYou feel like you want to jump off a bridge for the first week or more. You can\u2019t eat. You can\u2019t sleep. You are just throwing up and can\u2019t pull yourself out of bed,\u201d Jimenez said. The woman was pale, hardly speaking and \u201cyou could tell she hadn\u2019t showered in days,\u201d Jimenez recalled.\n\nThe RV staff helped her get a prescription and a counseling session, and the next time the woman came back for a drug screen and prescription renewal, she was a different person. \u201cShe was laughing and telling me about her visit with her kids,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cShe was just full of life.\u201d\n\nJimenez, who started working on the RV late last year, rolled into Limon one mid-morning last week. \u201cWe come to them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are giving people hope who didn\u2019t have any.\u201d", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com", "article_id": "0ef2650d-645c-4efe-8d39-0efc439d915b", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

About 12 years ago, her addiction landed her in jail for a month. Within 36 hours of her release, Jimenez was using again.\n\n\"It just all hit me that, 'Oh my Lord, I am an addict. I couldn't stop. I couldn't say no,'\" she said.\n\nBut Jimenez did say no. She went to treatment, got sober and continued her education. Last May, Jimenez earned a psychology degree from the University of Northern Colorado and is now the Mobile Health Unit's peer specialist.\n\n\"I just usually start off with small talk and if they need help finding resources for, let's say, homelessness, food, clothing, whatever it is that they might need help with,\" she said. \"That's what I'm here for.\"\n\nThe Mobile Health Unit is housed in a 34-foot Winnebago coach RV. It's small but fits a counseling room, a bathroom for a urine sample and an exam room. These are the necessary equipment and resources to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nThe unit provides medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to those addicted to opioids. MAT combines behavioral therapy with medications like buprenorphine or naltrexone, which reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The Mobile Health Unit also treats people with other substance use disorders.\n\nJimenez is part of a three-person, on-the-ground team that includes a nurse and licensed addiction counselor. Doctors are also available to meet with patients and write prescriptions via telehealth.\n\nFar Reaching Addiction Treatment\n\nIn 2018, Colorado received a federal opioid grant and used some of the funds to build six Mobile Health Units. They will serve 25 rural and frontier counties that were chosen for several reasons, including high opioid overdose death rates and lack of treatment facilities. The goal is to serve 300 people a week.\n\n\"What we plan to do is start in these communities. But while we're in these communities, we also want to get other providers to become medication-assistant treatment certified,\" said Robert Werthwein, director of the Office of Behavioral Health. \"Then hoping we build a capacity, then we can move on to the next community.\"\n\nFront Range Clinic was awarded three of the Mobile Health Units. The health care company provides MAT services at 19 brick and mortar locations and is embedded in more than a dozen community-based programs around the state.\n\n\"That's been part of the mission from the very beginning that we want to provide this low barrier, high access to care,\" said Jeremy Dubin, medical director at Front Range Clinic.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Front Range Clinic\u2019s Mobile Health Unit parked near their Greeley office.\n\nTwo of Front Range Clinic's Mobile Health Units are currently in operation. They are based in Pueblo and Greeley and serve the Eastern Plains.\n\nThe Greeley unit covers the northeast and serves patients in Sedgwick, Logan, Phillips, Lincoln and Kit Carson counties. In 2017, only two of the counties had a facility that provided medication-assisted treatment and, according to state data, didn't take Medicaid.\n\nThe Mobile Health Unit goes to the same six locations every week, including a caf\u00e9, museum, hospital, pharmacy and community center. The providers will treat anyone regardless of insurance and patients can make appointments or walk in.\n\nBefore the Mobile Health Unit, people had to travel to bigger Front Range cities for services.\n\n\"We saw someone in a very remote town who was taking an entire day off work every month just to get their medicine,\" said Donna Goldstrom, clinical director of behavioral health services at Front Range Clinic. \"Now since we're in his town he literally comes to the mobile unit over his lunch break to get treatment.\"\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nBefore the units were ready, Front Range Clinic met with hundreds of people around the state to learn more about their community's needs. Shaun Wilson, executive director of Hope House, a transitional housing facility in Sterling, attended a presentation and got concerned because no one with a substance use disorder was there.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Front Range Clinic\u2019s Mobile Health Unit uses a multi-panel drug test cup to test for 12 types of drugs.\n\n\"If we plan on addressing our opiate addiction, then I think what we need to be doing is listening to the voices of the individuals who are struggling with that addiction,\" Wilson said.\n\nWilson asked her residents to share their drug treatment experiences with Front Range Clinic.

But I'd still did it. Just makes no sense, you know. It's just really addicting.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Daley/Colorado Public Radio John Daley/Colorado Public Radio\n\nMeth is particularly insidious, she says, because it's cheap, readily available and \"very common. Everybody does it.\"\n\nHer assessment is in line with drug-overdose numbers from Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment, which show meth's enduring presence in the state. The drug was found in the systems of 280 Coloradans who died of overdoses in 2017 \u2014 up sharply from the year before. That number was more than five times that recorded in 2012.\n\nDenver Recovery Group's executive director, Denise Vincioni, says her organization still sees \"rampant use of methamphetamine.\" It's very difficult to treat on an outpatient basis, she says.\n\nAdmissions for the use of methamphetamine to what was once the state's largest drug treatment facility \u2014 the now-closed Arapahoe House \u2014 almost doubled from 2013 to 2017. Statewide figures for meth-related treatment admissions have also risen steadily over the last five years. And there's a new twist, Vincioni says: In the past, users mainly seemed to stick to one drug \u2014 opioid pills or heroin or cocaine. Now, they're using those along with meth.\n\n\"They're almost going hand in hand,\" says Vincioni.\n\nMcConnell says once people come in for treatment, \"They start to get off the opiates, but their meth use increases.\"\n\nLoading Graphic...\n\nContrary to the portrayal of meth production in popular TV dramas, the meth in Colorado these days is rarely cooked up in neighborhood basements from local drugstore ingredients. Instead, it's mostly imported, often along the same routes as heroin.\n\n\"I would say almost 100 percent of our meth comes from Mexico,\" says Tom Gorman, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. Much of it is mass produced there, he says, in \"superlabs.\"\n\nThe drug's continued impact shows up in police statistics. Denver arrests for possession of meth nearly tripled in 2017 compared to 2013. The amount of methamphetamine seized by HIDTA-funded drug task forces across Colorado, as well as by Colorado state patrol officers, went up sharply from 2016 to 2017.\n\nMeth has been overshadowed by opioids and marijuana in news headlines in Colorado recently, Gorman says, but \"we've had a meth problem in this area for a long time.\"\n\nAre more people using the drug now?\n\n\"Maybe,\" he says. \"But it's always been our number one problem.\"\n\nSara Florence at the Denver Recovery Group is a 36-year-old mother of three. Her reliance on drugs started early, she says \u2014 at age 15, when her parents gave her pain pills for a toothache. Just like that, she was hooked.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I grew up around it, you know,\" Florence says. \"It was around me, my environment. Both my parents were addicts, and so, you know, it was kind of rough not to be one.\"\n\nThose troubles eventually led to heroin and an eight year struggle with meth. The day she got arrested for stealing a Subaru was when she hit bottom, Florence says.\n\n\"I was homeless and had nowhere to live, and driving the stolen vehicle and sleeping in it.\" The ultimate charge, Florence says, was \"aggravated motor vehicle theft.\"\n\nThen it was off to drug court and eventually to the Denver Recovery Group. After seeing her drug test come back clean, counselor McConnell gave Florence a big hug.\n\n\"It's just so much better quality life now that I'm not doing anything,\" Florence says. \"This is the cleanest I've been since I was 15 years old.\"\n\nStill, Vincioni worries about the impact of this latest meth surge \u2014 how it could affect her clients. People with a dependency on more than one drug are that much harder to treat, and that limits their chances of \"continued sustained recovery,\" she says.\n\nHer facility treats clients on an outpatient basis, but Vincioni knows that many would need more intensive inpatient services to deal with a meth addiction.\n\n\"It's very difficult to stabilize patients who continue to use meth,\" Vincioni says.\n\nIf a client drops out of the treatment and counseling program at Denver Recovery Group, the staff often doesn't know what happens to them. The worry is they might not survive.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with Colorado Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.", "source_domain": "www.npr.org", "article_id": "78f4d1d8-57fb-4998-ad81-79734021ac83", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

His oldest has autism, and the family struggled to find the care they needed while living in a therapy desert.\n\nThat\u2019s why about six years ago, he put his career as an investor and entrepreneur on hold to start a pediatric mental health clinic in his Colorado community called Vail Mind Center. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, he learned something: the vast majority of the clinic\u2019s patients thrived while receiving care virtually.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018My gosh, if we can have this kind of impact virtually, I can do much more than just what we\u2019re doing here in our county,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nSponsored Post Improving Medical Billing to Cut Payment Bottlenecks Yusuf Qasim, President of Payments Optimization at Zelis, discussed how the company is transforming healthcare payments from a fragmented, patchwork system into a modern, digital infrastructure.\n\nSo three years ago, Graf founded Healthy Young Minds, an online youth mental health company. This month, the company was crowned winner of MedCity News\u2019 INVEST Pitch Perfect contest focused on pediatric mental health. A total of six companies participated in the contest.\n\nThe Denver-based startup treats children for a range of needs, including autism, anxiety and depression. Patients start with an evaluation to get matched with the right services and therapists. They\u2019ll then start their teletherapy sessions on a schedule that works for them. Healthy Young Minds\u2019 services include testing and diagnosing, psychology, art therapy, music therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy.\n\nThe company currently operates in six states: California, Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Texas and Georgia. It works with both Medicaid and commercial insurance plans and has about 35 million lives under contract.\n\nThere are several other companies addressing youth behavioral health \u2014 such as Brightline. However, a major differentiator for Healthy Young Minds compared to others in the space is the fact that it accepts Medicaid, Graf declared. And the need is there: There are nearly 40 million kids enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP, yet many are unable to receive mental health support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our goal and plan to be the leading Medicaid provider for kids across the country. And there\u2019s very little competition out there right now,\u201d Graf said. \u201cI expect that to change as we grow and demonstrate the viability of serving Medicaid, and it\u2019s very rewarding. So many of the folks out there that are working towards serving children, they don\u2019t take insurance at all, or they take commercial insurance. It\u2019s the exception if anyone\u2019s out there taking Medicaid. There\u2019s a lot of competition out there to serve kids. When I look at what I think is so exciting about Healthy Young Minds, it\u2019s that we have a model that is focused on serving the most underserved and the most needy in the country.\u201d\n\nThe startup has raised some funds as well. So far, Healthy Young Minds has secured $6 million (with Graf contributing about half), and it is currently in the process of raising its Series A round. This funding will go toward building its team, hiring more clinicians, developing its technology, expanding to new states, and establishing more partnerships, particularly with health systems.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is focused on engaging with as many Medicaid plans as possible while \u201cretaining the absolute highest quality care,\u201d Graf said.", "source_domain": "medcitynews.com", "article_id": "41be2de3-51a9-4a9b-a779-6a431a1acb49", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

However, that means we also need to make sure people understand the risks, know how to use it safely if they choose to and that healthcare systems are prepared,\u201d said Joshua Black, PhD, co-lead author and senior scientist at Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety, a division of Denver Health.\n\nThe study also revealed a gap in how well current medical coding systems track psilocybin-related problems in emergency departments. While poison center calls have gone way up, very few cases are recorded in hospital ambulatory data.\n\n\u201cIf hospitals and public health systems aren\u2019t seeing the full picture, they can\u2019t respond appropriately,\u201d Black said. \u201cImproved tracking tools and education are critical as more states consider regulating or legalizing psilocybin.\u201d\n\nThe study utilized data from five major national surveys from 2014-2023. Data was used from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Survey of Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs (NMURx), Monitoring the Future (MTF), the National Poison Data System (NPDS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS).\n\nThis was a collaborative project with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), but the views expressed here are those of the authors and may not represent the positions of SAMHSA.", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu", "article_id": "9220e9cd-eb8f-40a6-b005-c1f816ec2bcc", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

No other player could touch his mark of 28 3-pointers made during the 2 minutes.\n\n\u201cI knew early that inside wasn\u2019t really my game,\u201d Teff admitted. \u201cI focused all my life on shooting and have gotten really good at it. It is what got me here. I\u2019ve thankful that I put in all the work to get me here.\u201d\n\nThrough 10 games this season Teff is 33-for-94 from 3-point range for a pretty impressive 35 percent. He had a season-high 21 points on seven 3-pointers before winter break against Rocky Mountain.\n\nWhile becoming one of the best 3-point shooters in Class 5A took a lot of hard work, Teff also had to overcome being born with Cerebral Palsy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of had to adapt all my life,\u201d Teff said. \u201cIt just makes my right side a lot weaker than my left. Normal things are sometimes challenging for me. Opening a door or gripping stuff with my right hand. I\u2019ve been able to overcome and adapt.\u201d\n\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person\u2019s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood.\n\nTeff gives a lot of credit to his father for teaching him that he can do anything that he puts his mind to. Physical therapy for several years, dribbling weighted basketballs with his right hand to get stronger, along with getting in the weight room put Teff in the position to be a key contributor his senior year for the Chargers.\n\n\u201cHonestly, my first impression was it\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Chatfield boys basketball coach Erik Buehler said of Teff being able to reach playing at a 5A varsity level. \u201cBasketball is a sport that requires a certain amount of athleticism.\u201d\n\nTeff has proven himself to his coaches at every level that he can adapt and overcome some of his physical limitations.\n\n\u201cMidway through his sophomore year I was like, \u2018This kid is one of the best shooters I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cOn top of that even as a freshman his (basketball) IQ was well above his age. He just got smarter and smarter. He studied the game and to his credit he realized if he could become an elite shooter it would allow him to continue to play basketball.\u201d\n\nThere was never any doubt in Teff\u2019s mind that he could play high school basketball. One of his best friends \u2014 senior Christian Foutch \u2014 knew the two would be on the court as seniors for the Chargers.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the best players on the court all the time,\u201d said Foutch, who has been friends with Teff since preschool and was actually talked into playing organized basketball by Teff starting in the 7th grade. \u201cHe has definitely outworked everybody to be here. He put his mind to it and wanted to be here. It\u2019s cool that he wanted to be apart of this team and grind it out to be with me and a bunch of the other boys.\u201d\n\nFoutch actually didn\u2019t know Teff had CP until both were in a middle school together.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I had no idea Parker had anything until about the 8th-grade. We were doing pushups together,\u201d Foutch said. \u201cI asked him what was up. He said he has Cerebral Palsy. I was like, \u2018What? How long have you had that?\u2019 I had no idea.\u201d\n\nOpponents on the basketball court might not realize either. They might be too busy watching Teff drain 3-pointer after 3-pointer from the corner on them.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a kid with CP play varsity sports,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cI think his work ethic and mindset has allowed him to do that.\u201d", "source_domain": "chsaanow.com", "article_id": "f68bdd39-f9fe-4859-bb32-8ec3902b4265", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

The remaining two locations will only provide speech therapy and occupational therapy for children with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDDs).\n\nHopebridge\u2019s CEO, David McIntosh, attributes the cuts to Colorado\u2019s insufficient Medicaid reimbursement, intractable state officials and significant increases to state operating costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cColorado Medicaid has left us no other choice than to withdraw from ABA services,\u201d McIntosh said.\n\nHopebridge isn\u2019t the only autism provider facing these challenges. Low Medicaid rates are typical of safety-net health plans across the country. However, they are often especially low for most behavioral health services.\n\nFurther, inflation across the U.S. has effectively eaten away at the value of stagnant fee-for-service rates for several payer types.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNationally, consumer costs have increased 18.7% compared to May 2019 and 2023, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. In Colorado, prices increased 19.8%, similar to the Western region of the U.S. which saw a 19.4% increase.\n\nOperating in states like Colorado that have a higher-than-typical cost of living can create additional staffing challenges too.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer serve the autism population sustainably through ABA therapy, but we can continue to make a profound impact on these families through our speech and occupational therapy service offerings,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told Behavioral Health Business.\n\nThe two remaining centers \u2014 in Greeley and Westminster \u2014 will offer occupational and speech therapy to \u201can additional population,\u201d the company told BHB. These two offices will inform how to improve and expand these services through Hopebridge\u2019s 360 Care model.\n\nHopebridge operates in 12 states. McIntosh said that the company is also opening locations in Thompson\u2019s Station, Tennessee, and in Northport, Florida, and is also expanding speech and occupational services to all Tennessee locations.\n\nThe company has prioritized expanding supporting services via 360 Care through Hopebridge\u2019s footprint, McIntosh previously told BHB.\n\nHopebridge is owned by the New York City-based private equity firm Arsenal Capital Partners. The deal was announced in May 2019.\n\nHopebridge isn\u2019t the only provider facing these challenges. In recent weeks, another large private equity-backed autism therapy company announced it would shutter operations in a number of states, including Colorado. Invo Healthcare announced it will close its in-home and in-office care divisions. The move will result in over 1,000 people losing their jobs, 239 of whom are in Colorado.\n\nThe specifics related to Invo Healthcare\u2019s departure from Hopebridge differ at a fundamental level. Invo Healthcare did not have a large Medicaid patient base; \u201cIt was a tiny percentage for them,\u201d according to a spokesperson for the company.\n\nLow reimbursement without a moderating force\n\nWhile Hopebridge wouldn\u2019t disclose the share of its business that comes from Medicaid reimbursements other than to say that it serves \u201ca large Medicaid population in Colorado and our eleven other states.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s high exposure to Colorado\u2019s low Medicaid rate made it especially vulnerable to the increased cost of operating in the state. McIntosh said that inflation and cost of living rates seen at the company are 20% higher than the other states it operates in.\n\nOn top of the local economic forces, Hopebrige\u2019s struggle in Colorado demonstrates the challenge of engaging with state Medicaid programs.\n\nAutism therapy providers, along with other behavioral health providers, suffer from little enforcement of federal rules that require behavioral health services to be compensated at parity with physical health care services.\n\nBecause of autism therapy\u2019s focus on the pediatric population, it lacks the moderating influence of Medicare, the federal health plan for seniors.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the reimbursement for health care services that treat all age ranges, you have Medicare providing a sort of middle ground of what most provider will accept as the standard,\u201d Jeffrey Hulbert, chief revenue officer for Henderson, Nevada-based Center for Autism and Related Disorders (CARD), told BHB. \u201cThen, around that (Medicare), most commercial plans pay higher than that and most Medicaid plans pay lower than that.\u201d\n\nOther segments of health care can balance sources of health plan revenue when all three \u2014 commercial health plans, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 cover a patient population, Hulbert said. However, ABA services skew heavily toward Medicaid because most patients are children, covered by part of Medicaid that covers children, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nCARD presently operates 130 locations in 14 states, 9 of which are in Colorado.\n\nHulbert estimates that Medicaid and commercial reimbursement rates can differ by about 5% to 10%. That differential can be higher in states where Medicaid reimbursement is low and commercial health plan reimbursement is high.\n\n\u201cSome states (New Jersey) have higher reimbursement rates for ABA services, while others may have lower rates,\u201d Stacy DiStefano, CEO of Consulting for Human Services (CHFS), told BHB. \u201cAt CFHS we counsel our clients to have a portfolio mix and not rely on any one type of service.\u201d\n\nLessons learned from Hopebridge and Colorado\n\nABA providers in Colorado may be a canary for other autism providers accepting Medicaid across the country. Hopebridge opened its first location in the fall of 2020, persevering through the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. It had planned to open in early 2020.\n\nThe company announced in February 2020 that it would open its first two locations in Denver and Aurora and that it intended to open as many as 12 over the next 1.5 years.\n\nColorado has some features that make it an attractive state to do business. It\u2019s one of the fastest-growing states in terms of population. DiStefano said the state is known for being interested in creating greater accessibility to services. She pointed to a 2015 law that removed age and total payment caps on mandated autism coverage.\n\nABA coverage is not covered by the state\u2019s Medicaid managed care organizations; providers contract directly with the state.\n\nThat creates a handful of issues, according to Hulbert. CARD has grappled with Colorado\u2019s electronic verification system and other administrative requirements, making working with the state \u201cparticularly more burdensome than \u2026 some of the MCO states where the Medicaid plans are through a health plan.\u201d\n\nMCOs are often part of larger health insurance conglomerates with more savvy in handling health plans. Further, working with the same overarching organization\u2019s MCO and commercial health plans can lead to easier administration of claims.\n\nColorado Medicaid has left us no other choice than to withdraw from ABA services David McIntosh, CEO of Hopebridge\n\nHowever, the CEO of a Colorado-focused ABA company said his company hasn\u2019t had a similar administrative struggle working with the state. Regardless of the administrative aspect, the low rate and lack of meaningful increases have had and will likely have an impact on the direction of his company.\n\n\u201cWe want to serve Medicaid; it\u2019s core to our mission of what we want to do,\u201d the source told BHB. \u201cAt some point, we\u2019re going have to stop taking Medicaid or substantially reduce the number of Medicaid kids we treat or create waitlists.\u201d\n\nBHB granted the CEO anonymity because of the importance of the Colorado market to the company\u2019s operations and to allow frank insights.\n\nThis CEO said the company would always take some Medicaid patients but wouldn\u2019t jeopardize the company\u2019s sustainability by doing so.\n\nLike in other instances, the coronavirus pandemic touched off many of the challenges that autism providers face. CARD held up the pandemic as the driving force that led it into bankruptcy. Medicaid rates in Colorado were tight, the CEO said, but the pandemic made them unsustainable.\n\n\u201c[Low rates] force providers into things that really harm care quality,\u201d the CEO said, \u201cfor example, driving high [patient] ratios, adding lots of clients under one BCBA, penny-pinching with RBTs.\u201d\n\nStill, the direct proximity to the entity setting rates for ABA creates an opportunity for lobbying to lead to better future rates.\n\nSome states have changed their tune on reimbursement. Hulbert pointed to efforts in Louisiana in 2022. Lobbying efforts led to what he described as a \u201cpretty significant increase in their Medicaid rates.\u201d That bill passed in June 2022.\n\nColorado is undergoing an administrative process to reassess its Medicaid rates. The Medicaid Provider Rate Review Committee is holding a public meeting on July 14 that is slated to include behavioral health generally and pediatric behavioral health specifically.\n\n\u201cI would point to something like [the Louisiana rate increase] as an example to show that if the parties can come together, they might be able to find a solution, that may not be perfect, but may work for both sides,\u201d Hulbert said.", "source_domain": "bhbusiness.com", "article_id": "9142fb1a-72ce-4c71-9af0-3061ad2892a6", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}
{"url": "https://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=61778", "title": "Physicians\u2019 DEA Registration Now Requires Training on Substance Use Disorder", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Physicians who must register or renew their registration for a Drug Enforcement Administration license will face a new requirement as of June 27: To register, they will have attest to taking a one-time, eight-hour training on how to treat patients with opioid or other substance use disorders.\n\nDEA registration is renewable every three years, so that still gives many already-registered physicians time to meet the requirement, says Fredericksburg pain specialist Ralph Menard, MD, president of the Texas Pain Society (TPS).\n\nJust as important, many physicians have already met the criteria for the training because of other professional requirements. And those who haven\u2019t have several options \u2013 including CME from the Texas Medical Association \u2013 for getting trained, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\nPhysicians won\u2019t have to submit training-related documentation but should be able to reference it in the event of an audit, Texas Medical Association experts say.\n\nThe new requirement came under the Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act, which Congress passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Under the law, physicians and other health care professionals who prescribe Schedule II, III, IV, and V medications will be required to check a box on their online DEA registration form to show that they have done the training, SAMHSA says.\n\nThat means starting June 27, physicians who are new or renewing DEA registrants as of that date will need one of the following upon submission of their application:\n\nEight hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders.\n\nBoard certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry from the American Board of Medical Specialties, American Board of Addiction Medicine, or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).\n\nGraduation within five years from a U.S. medical school that included successful completion of an opioid or other substance use disorder curriculum of at least eight hours.\n\nCriteria for the eight hours of CME are flexible because \u201cSAMHSA has elected not to pursue the option to approve specific training organizations\u201d or \u201cundertake a lengthy rulemaking process\u201d about the training, the agency says. Given that, SAMHSA estimates that more than 2,000 organizations offer or plan to offer training that may satisfy the eight-hour requirement.\n\nQualifying CME options\n\nThose organizations include TMA, which offers several courses totaling 8 hours of relevant CME that is free for members.\n\nPhysicians also have flexibility in how to complete the training, says Mesquite pain specialist C.M. Schade, MD, a former TPS president. The training does not have to be completed in one session but can be spread out across multiple sessions that equal eight hours. And the trainings can occur in multiple formats, including in classrooms, seminars, professional society meetings, and online formats.\n\nTPS also is working quickly to develop a single eight-hour course to help physicians meet the DEA requirement, says Dr. Menard.\n\nOther Texas organizations, such as the Texas Opioid Training Initiative, also offer CME that appears to satisfy the mandate.\n\nPhysicians can complete the training with the help of national organizations such as the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, the American Medical Association, ASAM, AOA, and any organizations accredited by the AOA in CME, DEA says.\n\nWhile some CME courses are free, others are not, and physician leaders acknowledge many doctors understandably bridle at yet another unfunded, time-consuming professional requirement.\n\nAMA and other physician organizations successfully advocated against the requirement when it was proposed under the MATE Act in 2021. It was later tacked on last minute to the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act over medicine's objections.\n\nThe American Society of Addiction Medicine endorsed the new requirement, saying lack of standardization in addiction prevention and treatment has hampered the U.S. response to the addiction and overdose crisis.\n\nA mandate with a silver lining?\n\nMichael Sprintz, DO, a Houston specialist in pain, addiction, and anesthesia, sees a silver lining. Virtually all medical practices have at least some patients with undiagnosed substance use disorders and learning the basics can save physicians time and money because they\u2019ll be able to recognize those patients and get them treated.\n\n\u201cIt will make your practice easier because you\u2019ll start to see what you couldn\u2019t see before,\u201d said Dr. Sprintz, who is co-writing the curriculum for the TPS training. \u201cAn untreated substance use disorder is a real challenge to a practice. \u2026 Being able to identify a patient with a [substance use disorder] and helping to get appropriate treatment helps the patient, the practice, and the health care system overall.\u201d\n\nThe MATE training is not to be confused with the X waiver \u2013 a requirement for prescribing buprenorphine that the Consolidated Appropriations Act did away with, Dr. Schade says. That waiver required not only eight hours of training but also rigid documentation rules for prescriptions and the potential for inspection by DEA agents.\n\nReplacing the X waiver requirements with this broader training on substance use disorder for all health care professionals registering with DEA represents progress, he says.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org", "article_id": "5565d0e6-794b-4ab8-943c-0e4a5c4651e4", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

{"url": "https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/ryan-medrano-paralympics-track-running-el-paso-tx/", "title": "El Paso Paralympian Ryan Medrano readies to run in Paris", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Events are underway at the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris, and El Paso is once again represented on the track.\n\nRyan Medrano is a fitness trainer who is competing in his first Paralympics, in the 100-meter and 400-meter races \u2013 though some might also recognize him from TV\u2019s \u201cSurvivor.\u201d Medrano was cast away on an island in Fiji for the show\u2019s 43rd season.\n\nHe spoke with Texas Standard on growing up being bullied because he was born with mild cerebral palsy and how he pushed himself athletically, first through wrestling and then in track.\n\nThis transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:\n\nTexas Standard: Tell us about your journey to discovering yourself as an athlete and getting to the Paralympic Games.\n\nRyan Medrano: So as a kid, I didn\u2019t walk until I was 4, with mild cerebral palsy from being born three months early. I had fluid on the cerebellum of my brain; this affected my white matter and my brain\u2019s function, both neurologically and with my cognitive function.\n\nThis kind of made me a little bit of an outcast. I was bullied a lot, but I reverted to being good at sports and pushing myself as hard as I could to be the best version of myself. Luckily, I had loving parents and a plethora of siblings to really push me and make me be my best. So, you know, growing up, I really gravitated towards wrestling, and wrestling\u2019s one-on-one sport that allowed me to anticipate the movements of others and really push myself to be my best.\n\nBut I never really knew about the parasports and Paralympic world until I aired on \u201cSurvivor\u201d with Noelle Lambert. She pulled me aside after we were both voted off because we were voted off back to back, and she had stated, hey, you mild cerebral palsy, you can run the Paralympics. She opened that door for me, and she allowed me to get that information to make this journey possible. Without that, I would have just been a \u201cSurvivor\u201d guy, not a Paralympian.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve got to tell you congratulations on all of your accomplishments. And you\u2019ve got to wonder what those bullies are thinking right now. What does it mean to you to be among such an elite group of folks representing your country?\n\nIt\u2019s been mind-bending in a way. It\u2019s stupendous to go from like, like you said, being bullied to being the top percent of athletes in the world. But it\u2019s not only that gratitude you get from being able to represent your country, but it\u2019s the community and the friendship you find within that community that allows you to really become one with yourself, at least for me.\n\nBecause before the Paralympic or the para track and field world, I really didn\u2019t know as much about my disability, and I kind of shied away from it, because it made me, when I was younger, bullied, and it made life a little bit harder. So I tried to be as normal as possible.\n\nBut by being part of this community and learning more about myself and learning more about others and learning that I\u2019m not the only one that \u2026 feels pain or gets headaches while pushing too hard, or experiences these CP problems. It really has allowed me to accept more of myself and try to become a better version of myself. That\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get without experiencing this community and pushing myself to the absolute limit to be the best, you know?\n\nSelf development has been fantastic. And the honor and the pride I have in representing and making every person that believes in me, has ever said good luck \u2013 like my mother just other day said, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, but I am proud\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic to be able to show them that their belief was well put.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Laredo\u2019s first Olympian is going for gold in Paris this summer\n\nWhat an inspiring attitude you have. What events are you competing in during the Paralympics, and what sort of goals have you set for yourself here?\n\nSo right now I already have the start rights for the 100- and the 400-meter. I have asked and requested start rights for the long jump because I didn\u2019t long jump at trials. I wanted to make sure that my body was ready for the 100 and 400, because it takes a lot out of me.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m second in the world for the 400, and I have become faster in my 100. I was .07 off from third place in Japan, and I\u2019ve gotten more than that faster. So, I\u2019m really looking to pull out all the stops: At least second, at most first. You know, you always want to go for the gold. We\u2019re already here. There\u2019s no point in going, \u201coh, yeah, I might medal.\u201d No, I\u2019m going to medal; I just want to try to get the gold one.\n\nWhat your training routine like now?\n\nMy training blocks usually look like a Monday, Wednesday, Friday hard days: I work out at the track, and then I work out at the gym to superset. What this does is stimulate the neurons in your brain to be explosive for sprints.\n\nI\u2019ve always been strong. But strength doesn\u2019t equal power and speed. You have to translate that in your brain. So being able to do sprints and then a gym workout with Olympic lifts and structural functionality with, you know, being able to balance and have core experience, that really allows you to be functional on the track.\n\nAnd then my off days, or my functional off days, are going to be Tuesday and Saturday. I do a circuit, which consists of several workouts that mimic kind of a sprinting form but allows me to work arms, legs, arms, legs, and a circuit manner to increase my conditioning.\n\n\u00bb GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard\u2019s weekly newsletters\n\nI\u2019m sort of curious. You\u2019re so inspiring with the way that you talk about how you\u2019re going for the gold here. Do you have personal inspirations, role models, that sort of thing you may be watching?\n\nSo my personal inspirations are actually not in track and field. I would have to relate those back to my parents. I am impressed by Olympic athletes. They do fantastic. I love watching them. It is, like you said, inspirational. But my personal inspiration would be my mom and dad.\n\nMy dad is a war hero. He came from the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo, to fight for our country. And in Operation Iraqi Freedom was awarded the Bronze Star valor, for an outstanding performance and bravery in the war.\n\nBut my mom also was a stroke survivor. She was part of a class action lawsuit of women that experienced strokes from taking a birth control. When I was around 11 years old, she had a stroke that took out two-thirds of her brain. She was never supposed to walk, talk, eat on her own. But yet this woman does a market every Sunday with all the art that she paints.\n\nShe runs marathons. She does cycling without the use of her left side. She doesn\u2019t feel her left side. She can\u2019t see left. But yet she does not let that stop her. And as a child that grew up with traumatic brain injury or my mild cerebral palsy, it really connected me with my mother while she was going through that recovery process, and it helped her to have somebody there for her, and I really enjoyed being that person for her. And it made our connection stronger.\n\nSo having those parents that really have gone above and beyond, to have that full life and give me a life that I could be proud of and teach me, you know, to really give my all is my motivation. It\u2019s that hand on my back pushing me forward, to become better and and show them, you know, every step, every little fit that I threw as a kid was worth it. And they\u2019ve believed in me more than I believed in myself.\n\nOne of the reasons I ask that question is because I can\u2019t help but think others are going to be watching you and will be inspired by your performance in Paris. What sort of advice might you give to young athletes, especially those with disabilities, perhaps, who aspire to compete at these championship levels?\n\nSo that\u2019s a wonderful question. I\u2019ve actually gotten a lot of feedback from athletes that I\u2019ve helped, because I like to give tips and things at the track. If anybody seems interested, I ask them, \u201chey, you want to learn something?\u201d And I\u2019ve had several of my athletes come and message me, \u201ccongratulations, you\u2019re inspiring.\u201d And it\u2019s them reaching out and the fact that I\u2019ve inspired them that kind of warms my heart in a way.\n\nNot to be cheesy, but it really does put a smile on my face when somebody \u2013 not only athletic, but I have parents that have children with cerebral palsy that have been diagnosed. I recently had somebody message me on Instagram. I think their son\u2019s name was Clayton and he\u2019s 4 years old, started walking just a few months ago, and that was just like me. I started walking at 4.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the hope that I give, that light that people might not have had, that see my story and go, \u201cokay, it\u2019s not the end of the world. We have something to work towards, even if it\u2019s not quite that level. We can\u2019t just give up. We got to keep pushing.\u201d And it\u2019s that: You got to keep pushing. There\u2019s always another day; there\u2019s always another step to take. And it\u2019s not giving up on yourself and surrounding yourself with people that are going to hold you accountable.\n\nBecause some days, I\u2019m going to be honest with you, you don\u2019t want to do it. It\u2019s either a mental or physical block. And you got to really have a support group, whether it\u2019s a mantra you tell yourself or somebody that really is honest with you saying, \u201chey, you have goals, you need to go get it,\u201d that you need to set up for yourself. Because we are human and we have errors.\n\nBut it\u2019s keeping that environment as positive as possible, and as easy as it is to say no, make it that much easier to say yes \u2013 to go train, to go push yourself to be that best version of yourself, so you can look back and have no regrets, and you can be proud of everything that you\u2019ve done.", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org", "article_id": "a1b59fe3-1cb8-4c3c-b1c9-b6d7c944ae23", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

{"url": "https://bhbusiness.com/2025/05/05/proposed-trump-budget-reveals-28-6b-in-cuts-to-behavioral-health-science-related-agencies/", "title": "", "published_at": "2025-05-05T00:00:00", "full_text": "The Trump administration has proposed cutting over $28.6 billion in health care and mental health-related spending under its newly released discretionary budget for FY 2026. At the top of the chopping block is a nearly $18 billion deficit for the National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nAs part of the proposal, the agency will maintain $27 billion for research, the administration notes that the cuts were propelled by the NIH\u2019s \u201cwasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.\u201d The cuts will consolidate what Trump sees as redundant programs into five new areas of research, including a National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\nThe administration also suggests cutting nearly $3.6 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), $1.7 billion from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), more than $1 billion from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and $129 million from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recommendations propose the CDC maintain $4 billion. Still, the potential budget cuts propel the consolidation of funding for several health issues, including opioids and infectious diseases, into a single grant program with $300 million in funding.\n\nWhile the budget recommends that SAMHSA retain $5.7 billion for its research and activities, it will be absorbed into a new entity dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America. The document specifically demonizes how funding was used by the agency under the previous administration, criticizing that its grants \u201cwere used to fund dangerous activities billed as \u2018harm reduction,\u2019 which included funding \u2018safe smoking kits and supplies\u2019 and \u2018syringes\u2019 for drug users.\u201d\n\nAlthough the draft proposes to cut funding to these programs, harm reduction measures like the ones mentioned have been proven through evidenced-based research by SAMHSA and HHS to \u201cminimize negative consequences of drug use\u201d and decrease overdoses and negative effects of substance use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AHRQ, which has historically focused on setting quality standards across health care, including for behavioral health and on efforts to integrate behavioral health into primary care for more effective mental health treatments, will become part of the new HHS Office of Strategy. The recommended $129 million in cuts will slash spending on new grants and eliminate its digital health portfolio.\n\nUnder the proposal, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lose $674 million. Yet, the administration notes that this \u201cwill have no impact on providing benefits to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries\u201d and is strictly eliminating funding for \u201cnon-statutory, wasteful, and woke activities.\u201d\n\nResearch funding for the National Science Foundation will be cut by $3.5 billion for what the administration has deemed \u201cprograms in low-priority areas of science,\u201d which it cites \u201cbehavioral science\u201d falls under.\n\nAs of May 5, attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the administration over these cuts, particularly related to how \u201cmental health and substance use services have been completely gutted as a result of the administration\u2019s restructuring.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, the Department of Health and Human Services, now overseen by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will likely receive a suggested surplus of $500 million to help the secretary carry out his Make America Healthy Again priorities to address things like an \u201cover-reliance on medication and treatments,\u201d according to the documents.\n\nWhile mental health and substance use funding is being slashed in other departments, interestingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs is the only other health care-related area receiving a boost in proposed budget funding. This patient population tends to be disproportionately affected by mental health and substance use issues. It will receive an additional $3.3 billion for medical care, which includes supporting veterans\u2019 case management and support services and nearly $2.2 billion for electronic health record modernization.", "source_domain": "bhbusiness.com", "article_id": "9c5909ef-9a95-4862-9f6c-4d177998f029", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

Though Zucker described the experience as pretty miserable \u2013 he noticed Memphis always had a terrific attitude.\n\n\u201cAnd so I ended up reaching out to him afterwards. And what I learned is that he had been creating personal vlogs about his experiences for like nearly a decade at that point. And he had this real desire to share his story and have his experiences just be more visible to more people. And so we ended up deciding to kind of go on this journey together,\u201d Zucker said.\n\nOver the next five years, the two worked together to document Memphis\u2019 experiences navigating life and love. Memphis has cerebral palsy and, in Texas, does not receive government support.\n\n\u201c[Memphis is] an aspiring blogger and filmmaker and actor, and he\u2019s interested in coding. He just has all of these wide-ranging interests. And he\u2019s a romantic. And so in the film, we kind of follow him over the course of years as he pursues all of these interests, and comes of age in a universal and specific way,\u201d Zucker said.\n\nZucker says the documentary doesn\u2019t really come with a message. It could be seen as an intimate portrait of a person pursuing love and independence or as something more political considering one theme is Memphis\u2019 lack of government support in Texas.\n\n\u201cSometimes parents really engage with this story of how to protect your child while also supporting them and letting them fly and pursue their endeavors,\u201d Zucker said.\n\nBut, above all, Zucker hopes it\u2019s an opportunity for people to just get to know Memphis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for audiences to see a complex portrayal of someone who I think in all sorts of other spaces gets reduced to something much smaller,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cMemphis lives a really rich life filled with conflict and all the things that make up a human experience. And so that\u2019s the goal with the film, and I hope that lands.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Friend, Memphis\u201d is having its world premiere at the SXSW Film Festival \u2013 which runs March 11-20. The film actually features a few clips of Memphis volunteering at that same festival in 2015 so Zucker calls the premiere \u201ca real homecoming.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org", "article_id": "4555b623-c347-4415-87fd-2eef086cdeaa", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.854886"}

She dropped everything and drove to the daycare. As soon as she saw her son, she knew something was wrong. They rushed him to the Emergency Room at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d Claudia remembers. \u201cCamillo was just a baby. At the ER, he fell asleep. When he woke up, his face was drooping, and his right side seemed to be paralyzed. They decided to do an MRI.\u201d\n\nDoctors broke the news that Camillo had suffered a stroke.\n\n\u201cThey took him directly to the Intensive Care Unit,\u201d said Claudia. \u201cHe had bleeding in his brain, and they had to keep him in the ICU for ten days or so. Those were the worst ten days of my life.\u201d\n\nClaudia is an International Business Development Specialist at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, and she knew her son was in good hands. \u201cI felt grateful to be part of the team at Texas Children\u2019s. I have been working here for 27 years. As a mother, it was very comforting to know that Camillo was being seen by our doctors, by Texas Children\u2019s doctors, who are the very best doctors in the nation.\u201d\n\nAlthough Texas Children\u2019s saved Camillo\u2019s life, the stroke caused damage to his developing brain.\n\nEventually, Camillo was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.\n\nWhat is cerebral palsy?\n\nCerebral palsy is a broad term for a group of conditions that affect muscle tone, movement and posture. Typically, cerebral palsy is caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain \u2014 most often before birth. Cerebral palsy has a wide range of clinical severity with some children having only mild coordination, strength or tone difficulties while others have significant deficits and limitations.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of cerebral palsy?\n\nSymptoms of cerebral palsy vary greatly from person to person and can include:\n\nPoor coordination\n\nUnsteady gait\n\nTremors\n\nStiff or weak muscles\n\nExaggerated reflexes\n\nInvoluntary motions\n\nAbnormal movements of the hands, feet, arms, or legs\n\nIntellectual disability\n\nSeizures\n\nProblems with vision, hearing or speech\n\nChanges in the spine\n\nJoint problems\n\nWhile there's no cure, treatments can help improve motor skills and communication abilities. There are several types of cerebral palsy, including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic and mixed.\n\nThe three main types are:\n\nSpastic : muscle tightness and spasms\n\n: muscle tightness and spasms Dyskinetic : issues with muscle control\n\n: issues with muscle control Mixed: features of both the spastic and dyskinetic types\n\nPlaying sports with cerebral palsy\n\nImage\n\nFourteen-year-old boy improves athletic abilities at the Texas Children\u2019s Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory and pursues dream of one day competing in the Paralympic Games.\n\nCamillo is now 14 years old. \u201cHonestly, when I hear about what happened to me, I\u2019m just grateful to be alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I can still walk and do some of the normal things that other people can do. And I\u2019m so grateful for everything that Texas Children\u2019s has done to help me.\u201d\n\nThanks to his physicians, therapists, biomechanists and exercise physiologists at the Texas Children\u2019s Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory, Camillo can do much more than walk.\n\nHe is a talented athlete who plays more than six sports competitively.\n\n\u201cI play football, basketball, track and field, tennis, soccer and swimming,\u201d said Camillo. \u201cIn football, I\u2019m a kicker and defensive end. And I run the 100 and 200-meter races in track and field.\u201d\n\nMotion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory\n\nThe Texas Children\u2019s Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory, where Camillo is a patient, is a major part of the hospital\u2019s nationally-ranked Orthopedics program and one of the only pediatric labs of its kind in the state. It is a hallmark feature of Texas Children\u2019s Hospital The Woodlands, a 548,000-square-foot full-service pediatric hospital.\n\nLeveraging the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of physicians, therapists, biomechanists and exercise physiologists \u2014 along with state-of-the-art computer and sensor technology \u2014 the Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory studies, analyzes and helps improve how the human body moves. The laboratory is equipped with a 3D motion capture system, force platforms, a force plate instrumented treadmill, an electromyography system and a metabolic cart.\n\nOne lab. Two tracks.\n\nThe Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory serves two different patient groups with two different clinical focuses.\n\nPatients who have been referred for Clinical Gait Analysis typically have a movement disorder or underlying medical condition, like Camillo\u2019s, affecting their ability to walk. Clinical gait analysis is used to inform decisions about surgical interventions and/or the need for braces/prosthetic devices to address these movement-related issues. Patients with a variety of neuromuscular or musculoskeletal conditions including cerebral palsy, spina bifida, brain or spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophies, hip and joint problems or balance disorders come for Clinical Gait Analysis.\n\nPatients who have been referred for Sports Performance are typically athletes with injuries or issues related to athletic performance or specific functions, such as running or throwing. Physical therapists and sports medicine physicians use a wide range of functional and diagnostic assessments to inform the athlete\u2019s training and recovery regimens.\n\n\u201cAt the lab, Texas Children\u2019s is helping to strengthen my right leg \u2014 we\u2019re doing a lot of leg presses, squats and jumping,\u201d said Camillo. \u201cBecause of my condition, my right side will never be as strong as my left side, but they are helping me compensate for my disability and do better at sports.\u201d\n\nParalympic dreams\n\n\u201cOne of my main goals for the future is to get to the point where I can compete in the Paralympics,\u201d said Camillo. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about the lab at Texas Children\u2019s \u2014 the doctors really care about me, and they want to make my life better and to help me pursue my dreams.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what advice he would give to other patients who are facing similar challenges, Camillo says, \u201cNever give up on what you want to do in life and keep working hard, because eventually it will pay off. I want to encourage people not to give up on their dreams. My dream is to compete in the Paralympics, partly because it could help me inspire other people with disabilities like mine. And thanks to my doctors at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, I can say that it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the nationally-ranked Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Program at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital and the Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory.\n\nTo schedule an appointment, call 832-822-2778.", "source_domain": "www.texaschildrens.org", "article_id": "0a782799-488c-49f8-a0ef-902f811a1496", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

The initiative will remove barriers to entering the behavioral health workforce and provide support that might not otherwise be available to youth.\n\n\u201cThe Hummingbird Initiative is a multi-faceted initiative seeking to eliminate social and structural challenges that prevent youth from entering the behavioral health workforce,\u201d said Lilia Cervantes, MD, associate professor in the Department of Medicine at CU Anschutz, who will help lead the program.\n\nThe program will be offered at six schools\n\nCU Anschutz has developed a structured and culturally responsive pathway for students at six Colorado high schools, including youth living in rural, suburban and urban locations, to learn about behavioral health and help drive interest in behavioral health careers.\n\nThe Hummingbird Initiative will focus on the following key priorities, among others:\n\nEducation and employment : Offer certifications, entry-level employment and educational placements for teens moving through the Hummingbird pipeline.\n\n: Offer certifications, entry-level employment and educational placements for teens moving through the Hummingbird pipeline. Wrap-around services : Provide resources to students with social needs as well as address individual mental health challenges.\n\n: Provide resources to students with social needs as well as address individual mental health challenges. Mentorship : Provide structured advice from professionals on pursuing behavioral health careers as well as peer mentorship and school-based support.\n\n: Provide structured advice from professionals on pursuing behavioral health careers as well as peer mentorship and school-based support. Workforce development: Provide a roadmap for students to get stacking degrees (i.e., certification followed by associates and bachelors). This initiative will be through the CU Anschutz health science programs and community behavioral health programs. Every student in the Hummingbird Initiative will also have the opportunity to enroll in a certified nurse assistant (CNA), medical assistant (MA) or emergency medical technician (EMT) program, each of which is often required for entry level positions in behavioral health. Further, other trainings will be offered to students, such as Mental Health First Aid, Trauma-Informed Care, Substance Use Disorders and Opioid Addiction and Narcan Use.\n\n\u201cBy providing early exposure, mentorship programs, trainings and so much more for Colorado\u2019s teens, we will increase the possibility of a more diverse workforce. Further, this will reduce the academic achievement gap in high school to propel students into pursuing careers in the behavioral health field,\u201d said Katie Bakes, MD, an emergency physician at the Rocky Mountain Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who will also work on the initiative.\n\nWhat is behavioral health? The American Medical Association defines behavioral health generally as referring to \u201cmental health and substance use disorders, life stressors and crises, and stress-related physical symptoms. Behavioral health care refers to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of those conditions.\"\n\nThe initiative was made possible by the BHA.\n\n\u201cThe BHA is committed to strengthening and diversifying the behavioral health workforce, and one of the best ways we can do that is by inviting our emerging workforce to step up and step in. We are thrilled to partner with CU Anschutz to expand opportunities for greater numbers of youth throughout the state and develop future providers,\u201d said Wendy Simmerman, BHA\u2019s Director of Workforce Development.\n\nThe BHA will provide $4.2 million from Fiscal Year 2023 through Fiscal Year 2025 in behavioral health career pipeline funding to the Hummingbird Initiative, which aims to strengthen Colorado\u2019s behavioral health workforce, as directed by Senate Bill 22-181. This funding comes from Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds appropriated to the BHA from Senate Bill 22-181 and SAMHSA Supplemental Mental Health and Substance Use Block Grant funds.\n\nModeled after a successful program\n\nThe Hummingbird Initiative is modeled after a national coalition called FACES for the Future. CU Anschutz implemented this program, calling it Denver FACES, at Manual High School in fall of 2017. Since starting Denver FACES, all students participating in the program at Manual High School have graduated, compared to an overall school graduation rate of 69%. At the time of graduation, over 90% of participants intend to pursue a career in the health profession and continue directly into post-secondary pathways, including college, certification programs or employment.\n\nThis program also aligns with the successful longtime efforts of CU Anschutz, providing early exposure and pathway programming to diverse and BIPOC youth (Black Indigenous People of Color) led by Dominic Martinez, EdD, assistant vice chancellor for the Office of Education Initiatives and Career Pathways.\n\n\u201cThis initiative addresses socioeconomic challenges that have stalled progress in creating a more diverse behavioral health workforce. In Colorado and across the country, there\u2019s a significant disparity and lack of representation in this field. We\u2019re not only providing a better chance for a more diverse future but we\u2019re also providing mental health services to a population less likely to have access,\u201d said Regina Richards, PhD, MSW, vice chancellor at CU Anschutz\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Engagement.\n\nThe program will start in high schools beginning in the fall of 2023 and will include an application process for students and in-classroom teaching and trainings to set students up for success in future healthcare careers.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t see healthcare providers that looked like me. This program is meaningful because I see a reflection of myself in the students,\u201d said Chawtana Edwards, FACES for the Future Denver Program Manager.\n\nRachel Davis, MD, associate professor at the CU Department of Psychiatry, adds, \u201cI\u2019m very excited about this initiative because I grew up in rural Southeastern Colorado and my experience as a CNA and EMT in my town of 800 people introduced me to medicine and set me down the path of ultimately becoming a psychiatrist.\"\n\nAbout the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus\n\nThe University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus is a world-class medical destination at the forefront of transformative science, medicine, education and patient care.

These challenges unfortunately trickle down, creating cumbersome administrative burdens and patient care delays. Meanwhile, the lack of consistent BH data standards poses a major barrier to the exchange of information across stakeholders.\n\nThese issues are so universal, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have committed more than $20 million over the next three years toward addressing them. Through a series of SAMHSA grants focused on substance use treatment and mental health services, the initiative will identify a set of BH data interoperability standards (USCDI+), making it easier for providers to measure, evaluate and report on the care they provide.\n\nSponsored Post The Definitive Guide to Medical Billing Outsourcing: 5 Top Companies In today\u2019s healthcare landscape, your choice of medical billing partner directly impacts your bottom line. What are the best medical billing outsourcing companies, and which one is right for you?\n\nThese standards will be critical to advancing BHIT interoperability. But while states and providers alike look forward to a more consistent approach to data collection and management, many are still unsure of how we\u2019ll get there. Even with standardized criteria, providers and states all operate in a wide range of technological sophistication and capabilities. The tools they use likewise employ various processes, data and file types.\n\nVariation in capacity, resources and infrastructure will make these standards challenging to implement nationwide. While providers and administrators struggle to identify the best next step to meet new standardization rules, they need a strategy tailored to the intricacies of their program, based on their specific data workflows \u2014 which might look vastly different state to state.\n\nDesigning a tailored BHIT solution\n\nFor public health programs to succeed in interoperability, they must understand their specific pain points and capacity for change. For instance, in Colorado, the Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) identified a barrier in its mission to provide comprehensive, equitable and accessible behavioral health services to its citizens: medication-assisted treatment (MAT) admissions.\n\nAlthough Colorado had services readily available to help its population, the intake process was cumbersome. Administrators had to manually collect information and match behavioral health needs to resources, causing patients to sometimes wait for days to be enrolled in a life-saving treatment program. The existing process did not consider the various formats of data sources needed for this undertaking: PDFs, proprietary MAT registries, spreadsheets and more.\n\nWhile Colorado was using some technologies available to them, the tools were not cohesive, causing delays with the intake process for providers, patients and state administrators.\n\nOnce they identified this acute challenge, the BHA worked with their public health technology partner, to understand the state of current workflows and technological need . Thus, the state\u2019s centralized registry was born.\n\nDesigned to streamline data collection and automate patient intake and program matching, the MAT registry enables decision support, automatically de-duplicates patient records and normalizes data from existing disparate sources to create a more impactful reporting and analytics process.\n\nConversely, organizations in Michigan are utilizing technology to increase access to behavioral health directly to patients. Family Health Care, a Federally Qualified Health Center, leveraged virtual health solutions in Mecosta, Missaukee, Newago, and Wexford counties to expand access to substance use disorder and opioid use disorder treatments. These counties are not only facing a provider shortage, but many patients reside in areas where lack of public transportation poses a significant barrier to access. By offering treatment via telehealth, transportation and geographic location were eliminated from the equation entirely, allowing more patients to receive the care they need.\n\nThe Upper Peninsula of Michigan faced its own set of challenges. Long travel distances, lack of health literacy and a substantial shortage of psychiatric care providers made access to behavioral health burdensome for patients. Great Lakes Recovery Center collaborated with a digital platform to connect Medicare, Medicaid and MI Health Plan members to their care teams. By leveraging the virtual health platform, patients can now set appointments, receive notifications and reminders, and flag their needs to providers. Similarly, providers were able expand their care and impact outside of their offices allowing them to follow up on appointments and send alerts and treatment information directly to patients.\n\nColorado and Michigan are prime examples of areas that took time to examine barriers and implement dedicated solutions to better serve patients and staff. But what works well in one state or county might not necessarily solve every BHIT need across the rest of the nation.\n\nAddressing the full BHIT spectrum\n\nWhile one state might have a lot to learn from its neighbors\u2019 approach to BHIT, the administration that tries to copy directly from another state\u2019s data playbook will likely wind up with an ill-fitted strategy that doesn\u2019t suit their program long-term. One-size-fits-all solutions simply can\u2019t address all the nuances across this wide range of technological capabilities and BH complexities.\n\nThat\u2019s why, for this new SAMHSA/ONC initiative to work \u2014 and for BH data exchange to mature overall \u2014 new IT solutions must be tailored to fit the unique needs of each state health administration and its provider partners. Understanding and addressing the entire tech spectrum of these groups will ensure that new solutions alleviate, rather than exacerbate, the administrative and interoperability burdens they face.\n\nFor example, BH entities with limited technological capabilities need simple digital front-end solutions to replace cumbersome paper-based processes, with solutions like automated SAMHSA reporting. Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum, those with more sophisticated IT systems need a robust solution that connects the dots between existing digital tools to help manage integrations and streamline data exchange across platforms.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no singular playbook to guide the path toward BHIT interoperability, state administrators and healthcare providers must be willing to collaborate with the experts to tailor their approach to data exchange. Ultimately, a standardized approach will eventually run into issues in a space as complex and nuanced as behavioral health itself. Although taking the time to design a customized solution might seem daunting, it\u2019s the only path to sustained success for interoperability initiatives across our 50 united, but unique, states.\n\nDisclaimer: The author\u2019s employer is a public health technology partner for the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration (BHA).\n\nPhoto: erhui1979, Getty Images\n\nCarter Powers Carter Powers is both Dimagi\u2019s Managing Director of the United States Health Division as well as Dimagi\u2019s Co-President as the chair of Dimagi\u2019s Executive Committee.

The development will also include a chapel, medical clinic, cafe, mental health clinic and counseling areas. It will serve people in need of long-term services, including seniors and those with physical and cognitive disabilities.\n\nPriscilla Rice / KERA A one-bed, one-bath tiny home will be about 390 square feet.

Although the vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are significant, it is difficult to determine the number of people impacted due to the frequent occurrence of VCID with other etiologies and comorbidities.\n\nAdvances in neuroimaging have identified a high prevalence of brain white matter damage in persons with VCID, leading to consensus that slow progressive changes in the brain related to cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) are a major mechanism involved in VCID.\n\nAdditionally, as life expectancy increases worldwide, the global burden of age-related cognitive impairment, including presumed vascular etiology, will rise. Therefore, the study authors believe that any intervention that alleviates the burden of VCID should be investigated.\n\n\u201cDespite the pressing need to develop VCID biomarkers, only a few can reliably detect and track SVD changes leading to VCID, and these have yet to be approved by regulatory agencies to be used in clinical trials,\u201d said Alison Luckey, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow with the Biggs Institute and first author of the study.\n\nCurrently, the most used neuroimaging marker of SVD is white matter hyperintensities (WMH). However, the etiology of WMH remains undetermined and is further suggested to not only represent vascular lesions but also neurodegeneration.\n\nEnter, PSMD\n\nThe new study notes that PSMD had shown excellent instrumental properties as a marker, meaning it showed reliability across users, sites and time points. So, the scientists set out to extend their work to perform a biological validation, defined as the association with clinically meaningful aspects of VCID, such as cognitive performance.\n\nThe UT Health San Antonio-led team studied a group of 396 participants from the MarkVCID consortium (https://markvcid.partners.org), founded from an initiative of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to identify, develop and validate fluid- and imaging-based biomarkers for the SVDs associated with VCID.\n\nFor their study, the scientists derived PSMD from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using an automated algorithm, and related it to a composite measure of general cognitive function using linear regression models adjusting for confounders.\n\n\n\nFrom that, they observed that higher PSMD was associated with lower general cognition in MarkVCID, independent of age, sex, education and intracranial volume. The findings were replicated in three independent samples. Further, PSMD explained cognitive status above and beyond WMH, the more common cerebrovascular marker.\n\n\n\nThe researchers concluded that PSMD has ideal biomarker qualities for the clinical trial pipeline across the most common form of dementias, as it is non-invasive, fully automated, fast and has excellent reliability, repeatability and reproducibility.\n\nAdditional longitudinal validation studies assessing the use of PSMD as a surrogate of cerebral small vessel diseases are underway.\n\nOther authors of the study are with the Boston Chobanian & Avidisian University School of Medicine; Boston University School of Public Health; National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health; Harvard Medical School; University of New Mexico School of Medicine; University of New Mexico; University of Kentucky; University of California at San Francisco; and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nAlso, the University of Mississippi Medical Center; Icelandic Heart Association; University of Iceland School of Health Sciences; University of California at Davis; Massachusetts General Hospital; University of Southern California; The Mind Research Network; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston; Illinois Institute of Technology; and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nUT Health San Antonio is a world-class research university, ranking at the top 5% among institutions globally for clinical medicine according to U.S. News & World Report. It is No. 12 in the world among universities for the impact of its discoveries \u2013 in normalized citation impact, which compares the number of citations its research receives per paper to the average for similar published work, a recognized core measure of research impact.\n\n\n\nBiological validation of peak-width of skeletonized mean diffusivity as a VCID biomarker: The MarkVCID Consortium\n\nAlison M.

The scientific community widely recognizes that most dementia cases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, are related to a combination of vascular and neurodegenerative lesions.\n\nAnd cerebral small-vessel disease is thought to be the main underlying contribution to cognitive decline and dementia, with nearly half of dementia cases showing both Alzheimer\u2019s and cerebral small-vessel disease neuropathologic characteristics, the study notes.\n\nStill, while observational studies had shown evidence of an association between white matter hyperintensity burden and increased risk of stroke and dementia, causal evidence had been limited. White matter hyperintensities are lesions in the brain that show up as areas of increased brightness in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nIn the new study, researchers were able to provide evidence of a causal link between vascular traits and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, using genetic instrument variable analyses known as Mendelian randomization \u2013 a method that leverages the natural randomization of genetic alleles to test how differences in the genetic effect on modifiable exposure influence disease risk.\n\nSpecifically, in a two-year analysis ending July 24, 2022, and using Alzheimer\u2019s disease genome-wide association studies of up to 75,000 European dementia cases, they found causal evidence of an association of larger WMH burden with increased risk of the disease, accounting for pulse-pressure effects.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of combining several complementary epidemiological approaches and data types, and of accounting for caveats of instrumental variable analyses when exploring the impact of vascular traits on late-onset diseases like dementia.\n\n\u201cAs vascular disease is a treatable contributor to dementia risk, our findings have broad significance for prevention strategies of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia as a whole,\u201d Sargurupremraj concluded.\n\nThe researchers advise future studies to examine whether their findings can be generalized to non-European populations.\n\nOther institutions and entities represented in the study include the University of Bordeaux (France); University of Washington; University of Michigan; University of Tartu (Estonia); Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam (Netherlands); Boston University and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Framingham Heart Study; Icelandic Heart Association (Iceland); Washington University, St. Louis; University of Oxford (United Kingdom); Department of Public Health, Bordeaux (France); University of Pittsburgh; University of Lille (France); Radboud University, Nijmegen (Netherlands); Universidad Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Santiago (Chile); University of Iceland (Iceland); Oslo University Hospital, Oslo (Norway); Norwegian University of Science and Technology; Imperial College London (United Kingdom); National Institute on Aging; and Bordeaux University Hospital (France).\n\nUT Health San Antonio is a primary driver of San Antonio\u2019s leading $44.1 billion health care and biosciences sector, and is the largest academic research institution in South Texas with an annual research portfolio of $413 million.\n\nGenetic Complexities of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Blood Pressure, and Dementia\n\nMuralidharan Sargurupremraj, Aicha Soumar\u00e9, Joshua C.

Film producer Karin Gornick was inspired to dive into the nation\u2019s growing rate of school-aged children being diagnosed with anxiety after trying to find help for her son.\n\nGornick\u2019s pursuit along with Scilla Andreen, Matt Skerritt and Stephanie Riggs resulted in Angst, a documentary that follows the story of several young people sharing their journeys with anxiety.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a filmmaker, but more importantly, a parent,\u201d Gornick told about 175 people during a May 30, 2019 screening at The Health Museum presented in coordination with The Hackett Center for Mental Health and Okay to Say. May is observed as Mental Health Awareness Month.\n\n\u201cMy son was struggling with severe anxiety and it wasn\u2019t until I started opening up to some friends that I was led to help\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we found out how treatable anxiety was, I thought, \u2018Wow. We can really capture this so other parents don\u2019t feel like they are alone and know to reach out.'\u201d\n\nTurnout for the screening required an overflow room nearby. Gornick said the documentary is only being screened in community settings and is not available for streaming online due to potential triggers the film may cause.\n\nThe 56-minute film explores what living with anxiety is like for young people across the county. From achieving high test scores to getting into the right college or even walking into a full classroom a few minutes late, many of the children described their anxiety as debilitating.\n\nHeralded swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, has shared his struggles with mental health. He made a special visit to a young man suffering from anxiety at the end of the documentary.\n\nA panel discussion followed the screening. Marcy Melvin, professional counselor and director of program implementation for child and family policy of the Texas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute and Anna Lee Carothers, a recent University of Texas graduate and former UT chapter president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) joined Gornik to share their expertise about anxiety.\n\n\u201cMost of you in this room and in our overflow room were probably able to see yourself or a loved one in one of the individuals talking,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cI love how they explained the science behind what happens with anxiety; sometimes feelings can sound like an abstract thing, but anxiety really lies in the brain.\u201d\n\nFortunately, as the film and local experts explained, anxiety is highly treatable. Gornick and Melvin suggested reaching out to local organizations to learn more about treatment options.\n\n\u201cOnce you know you have an anxiety disorder, it\u2019s not like living with an anxiety disorder for the rest of your life,\u201d Gornick said. \u201cNow that you know, it, you can name it and tame it.\u201d\n\nVisit angstmovie.com to learn more about the film or for information about how to host a screening.", "source_domain": "www.tmc.edu", "article_id": "b9a26458-6098-4835-b516-b81f031cbf99", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Since August she's been training in family medicine at Salud Family Health Center in Fort Morgan.\n\n\"I really like the continuity of family medicine,\" Hungenburg said. \"We call it 'womb to tomb.' I like that wide age range because I like pediatrics, but I also like geriatrics. I kind of get a little bit of everything.\"\n\nIn Morgan County and the 15 other counties that make up Colorado's Eastern Plains, caregivers like Hungenburg face a difficult problem: Opioid overdose deaths are becoming more common. From 2014 to 2016 these counties had an opioid overdose death rate of 20.6 per 100,000 residents, higher than the state rate of 15.8.\n\nOne way to combat the growing crisis is through medication-assisted treatment, or MAT.\n\n\"I think it's definitely needed, especially in rural areas,\" said Hungenburg. \"If, as primary care physicians, we can provide that, we should be doing that.\"\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Sandi Garcia and Morgan Hungenburg work at Salud Family Health Center in Fort Morgan, which completed the IT MATTTRs Primary Care Practice Team Training.\n\nYoung, bright-eyed and energetic, Hungenburg has taken the required course for her waiver that allows her to prescribe MAT like buprenorphine, but there's an issue: She's the only provider where she works with it.\n\n\"Because I'm a resident, it means I'm still in training, so I have several supervising physicians,\" she said. \"I'm waiting for one of them to be able to prescribe it with me before I can start.\"\n\nFor now, that means there's no one at this Fort Morgan facility who can write the prescription, despite having a provider who meets the requirements.\n\nAn issue of people power\n\nThe lack of medical providers who can prescribe MAT is a problem not only in eastern Colorado but throughout the state - and the country. There is a nationwide push to get more medical providers waivered to write buprenorphine prescriptions, and a new study is taking the training a step further.\n\nThe three-year study is called Implementing Technology and Medication Assisted Treatment Team Training in Rural Colorado, or IT MATTTRs, and it is designed to address the needs of residents in eastern Colorado and the San Luis Valley.\n\n\"We recognize there are many different ways to approach the problem of opioid use disorder, this focuses on treatment and how to increase the capacity in rural practices and communities to be able to provide treatment because it's like a barren, barren, landscape right now,\" said Linda Zittleman, co-director of the High Plains Research Network.\n\nHPRN, based at the University of Colorado Department of Family Medicine, created the study. It is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nBefore the study began, HPRN identified only two providers with the required DEA waiver in the two regions. Their first goal is to help providers get trained and get the waiver to increase that number to 10.\n\nIT MATTTRs started in October 2016. Since then, 30 providers - at least 22 of them in eastern Colorado - have completed the prescribing waiver training. Another 17 have requested their waiver from the DEA.\n\nBut Zittleman found that getting providers trained is not enough.\n\n\"A provider goes through training, (goes) back to the practice and the rest of the team may not know how to support that,\" she said. \"They don't know the other components of medication-assisted treatment.\"\n\nEnter the second part of the IT MATTTRs program: a curriculum to teach medical practices about opioids, addiction and MAT.\n\nThe Primary Care Practice Team Training aims to better equip practices with the information and resources needed to better serve patients with opioid use disorder. The training is for the whole staff, from the front desk and medical assistants to doctors.\n\n\"One of the main things we learned is that you have no idea what an opioid-dependent or opioid-addicted person looks like.\"\n\n\"It's vital to train the entire practice team,\" said Lori Jarrell, practice facilitator and trainer with the High Plains Research Network. \"This is an issue that's complex and we all have personal and professional bias, thoughts, ideas, experiences with that.\"\n\nThe study wanted to recruit 40 health care practices to take the team training. Thus far, 42 have been recruited and 40 have completed the training. Thirty of these practices are in eastern Colorado, including Salud Family Health Center in Fort Morgan. All 50 staff members participated in the four, hour-long, sessions.\n\n\"It takes the stigma away,\" said Sandi Garcia, center director of Salud in Fort Morgan. \"One of the main things we learned is that you have no idea what an opioid-dependent or opioid-addicted person looks like.\"\n\nGetting the community involved\n\nThe High Plains Research Network was established 20 years ago and covers the 16 counties in eastern Colorado. The group works with primary care practices, hospitals, public health agencies and communities in rural eastern Colorado on a variety of research studies and programs that are relevant to and contribute to the health of people living there.\n\nAbout 15 years ago they formed a community advisory council to help guide its work. The council has worked on a variety of health issues like asthma, colon cancer, high blood pressure - and now opioid addiction and treatment.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Maret Felzien, fourth-generation rancher in Sterling, Colorado has been on the High Plains Research Network's community advisory council for 15 years.\n\nCouncil members live in the various Eastern Plains counties and are farmers, ranchers, teachers, large and small business managers, students and retirees.\n\n\"Folks who are not medically trained, they're not public health professionals but they live in eastern Colorado,\" Zittleman said. \"So they know what it's like to live there, they know how people communicate, they know what's going on in the community.\"\n\nThat community understanding is essential to the third part of IT MATTTRs, where the council developed a community-based component. They created the awareness campaign \"Have You Met MAT?\" aimed at changing the conversation around opioid addiction.\n\n\"Our work follows a pretty specific process,\" said Maret Felzien, a fourth-generation rancher and director of academic support services at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling.\n\nShe and husband, Ned Norman are members of the community advisory council.\n\n\"The first process is really beginning to understand what is the situation and what do we need to know about this health issue?\" she said.\n\nAt first the council met quarterly to get an in-depth education about opioids, addiction and treatment. Then they translated the medical information and jargon around opioid use disorder and MAT into concepts, messages and materials that are meaningful and actionable to community members.\n\n\"While there's this curriculum going on in the clinics and this education process in the clinics,\" Felzien said, \"our desire was to start to get people to see and think and hear about (medication)-assisted treatment and to talk about opioid use and abuse.\"\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC The High Plains Research Network's community advisory council created an awareness campaign aimed at changing the conversation around opioid addiction in eastern Colorado. Materials include coasters, posters and inserts for use in churches, bars, health care offices and libraries.\n\nThe \"Have You Met MAT?\" campaign launched last spring. It includes movie theater ads, newspaper articles and informational letters sent to law enforcement workers.\n\nThere are also handouts like coasters, inserts, posters and placemats. The materials are printed with images representative of the Eastern Plains - such as barns and the Pawnee Buttes.\n\n\"It's really important to our community that when we put out publications into our community that it reflects our personalities,\" Felzien said.\n\nOne of the posters features a black and white photo of a player in uniform holding a football in front of his face. In bold green and white letters it reads, \"Deaths from opioid drug overdose increase 300 percent in eastern Colorado over the past decade.\"\n\n\"I've had a lot of patients really in the last few months saying they want to get off opioids.\"\n\n\"Sports are really important to us,\" Felzien said. \"We're small towns, we're small communities, we revolve around our schools and our school's athletics. And so this is the image that looks like us. It could be one of our kids, likely is.\"\n\nMembers of the community advisory council have distributed tens of thousands of the handouts to many local establishments including churches, restaurants, bars, banks, libraries and liquor stores.\n\nBen Brunner has a poster and some inserts on display at his pharmacy in the town of Brush in Morgan County.\n\n\"I've had a lot of patients really in the last few months saying they want to get off opioids,\" he said. \"I think it's helping. It's kind of drawing attention, saying, you know, there's a problem out there and a lot of people probably shouldn't be taking these on a daily basis.\"\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Ben Brunner displays a poster from the \"Have You Met MAT?\" campaign at his pharmacy in Brush, Colorado.\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of the IT MATTTRs program, researchers will conduct pre- and post-surveys with community members, patients and primary care practice teams.\n\nBut the study has already made an impact. The Colorado Office of Behavioral Health has included the prescribing waiver training and Primary Care Practice Team Training in the state targeted response to the opioid crisis grant program.\n\nThrough the IT MATTTRs statewide dissemination efforts over 115 primary and behavioral health care practices have or will receive the team training. Also 480 providers have completed the training and about 375 have requested their waiver from the DEA.\n\n\"So what we want to do with the IT MATTTRs program,\" Jarrell said, \"(is) for people to find options and treatment available within their local communities to get whatever is that they need for care to be able to be successful in their life.\"", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org", "article_id": "67853e2c-2c75-467d-825d-ce86b7486bb6", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

While HCA Healthcare is helping combat the opioid epidemic as a whole, we are also committed to creating healthier tomorrows for our tiniest patients impacted by opioids, infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Read on to find out how the NICU Rockers program plays an important role in the non-pharmacologic management of NAS.\n\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome (also called NAS) is a group of conditions caused when a baby withdraws from certain drugs he\u2019s exposed to in the womb before birth. Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) care for babies with NAS, who need additional support in their first days, weeks or months of life.\n\nEvery fifteen minutes, a baby is born in the United States suffering from opioid withdrawal, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nOur colleagues, communities and volunteers are bringing hope and resilience to the opioid epidemic by breaking down the stigma around substance use disorders for mothers and their unborn babies. With initiatives in surgical, emergency and other care settings, we are ensuring that our patients have access to safer, more effective pain treatment, raising awareness about the dangers of opioid addiction and providing proper disposal of these medications.\n\nNow, another spot in our commitment to curbing the tide of the opioid crisis: HCA Healthcare volunteers are providing warmth, safety and security to babies exposed to opioids in utero through the NICU Rockers program at affiliate TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nWhat is neonatal abstinence syndrome?\n\nDr. Ashraf Hamdan, neonatologist\n\n\u201cNeonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) or neonatal withdrawal syndrome is a group of problems that occur in a newborn who was exposed to addictive illegal or prescription drugs while in the mother\u2019s womb,\u201d says Dr. Ashraf Hamdan, a neonatologist at TriStar Centennial Medical Center.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, symptoms of NAS most often appear in infants within the first three days after birth. While symptoms may appear and vary by infant, Dr. Hamdan outlines a few common signs and symptoms of NAS, including high-pitched cries, restlessness (with sleep duration less than 1-3 hours after feeding), hyperactive reflexes, jitteriness, tremors, myoclonic jerks (involuntary muscle jerk) and convulsions.\n\nThe solution to managing and treating NAS is not always medication. Physical touch can help aid in managing the infant\u2019s withdrawal symptoms. \u201cThe first line of treatments is to try to calm them and sooth them rather than jumping on medications,\u201d Dr. Hamdan told Nashville\u2019s NewsChannel5.\n\nNICU Rockers: healing through physical touch\n\nAmber Price, chief operating officer at TriStar Centennial Women\u2019s Hospital and the Children\u2019s Hospital at TriStar Centennial\n\nAs a result, HCA Healthcare\u2019s TriStar Centennial Medical Center developed NICU Rockers, a volunteer program focused on soothing and comforting infants experiencing NAS by holding and rocking them.\n\n\u201cOur NICU wants to make sure that every baby has a loving pair of arms available around the clock, even when parents can\u2019t physically be present,\u201d says Amber Price, chief operating officer at TriStar Centennial Women\u2019s Hospital and the Children\u2019s Hospital at TriStar Centennial. \u201cAll of our NICU Rockers are specifically trained to soothe these babies, and are available for other babies who need holding for any reason.\u201d\n\nRocking infants with NAS helps to maintain a consistent environment for the infant throughout the withdrawal process.\n\n\u201cSwaddling, pacifiers, low lighting, oscillating cribs and avoidance of abrupt changes in the infant\u2019s environment can be helpful. NICU Rockers play an important role in the non-pharmacologic management of NAS,\u201d says Dr. Hamdan. \u201cRecent studies suggest that the Eat/Sleep/Console (ESC) approach has decreased exposure to pharmacologic agents and decrease length of stay for babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome.\u201d\n\nNICU rocker volunteers also find the program rewarding.\n\n\u201cComforting a baby in withdrawal of opioids is at times a challenge, however, it is such a blessing and a rewarding experience,\u201d said NICU Rocker volunteer, Carol Bingham. \u201cI\u2019m proud to provide singing, soothing, rocking and touch to a baby in need.\u201d\n\nInterested in volunteering as a NICU Rocker? Click here for more information.\n\nNICU Rocker volunteer, Carol Bingham, comforts a newborn at HCA Healthcare\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital at TriStar Centennial.\n\nNot only does the NICU Rockers program help families while in the hospital, the program also offers support once the family leaves by providing them with a virtual toolbox to use at home.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to launch healthy families. Every baby deserves a healthy family to go home to, and by supporting our mothers we are helping them come home to a safe and supportive environment,\u201d says Price. \u201cThe families go home with a virtual toolbox of things they can pull out in challenging situations.

From hurricanes to global pandemics to mass casualty events, we help our colleagues obtain the resources they need to provide patient-centered care in the midst of any emergency. With an estimated 24.9 million human trafficking victims worldwide, human trafficking is an emergency that we have a duty to respond to with a more personalized approach to caring for our communities.\u201d Mike Wargo, HCA Healthcare\u2019s vice president of enterprise emergency operations\n\n\u201cAt the local level, we collaborate with law enforcement and community-based providers to identify, interact and intervene in situations where human trafficking is suspected,\u201d Wargo adds. \u201cBy focusing on awareness and intervention, our colleagues can help human trafficking victims transition into a pathway of survivorship.\u201d\n\nHCA Healthcare\u2019s Enterprise Emergency Operations Center (EEOC) is made up of nearly 200 leaders who work with experts across the country to plan and execute crisis responses.\n\nHCA Healthcare has teamed up with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) to provide online and in-person trainings to HCA Healthcare colleagues to inform and enhance the public health response to human trafficking. OTIP provides human trafficking training to professionals in healthcare, behavioral health, public health and social services settings through SOAR Online, which is administered by the National Human Trafficking Training and Technical Assistance Center (NHTTAC). The SOAR program teaches professionals how to:\n\nS TOP: describe the types of trafficking and common risk factors\n\nTOP: describe the types of trafficking and common risk factors O BSERVE: identify individual and indicators of human trafficking\n\nBSERVE: identify individual and indicators of human trafficking A SK: screen and identify individuals who may have experienced trafficking using a trauma-informed and person-centered approach\n\nSK: screen and identify individuals who may have experienced trafficking using a trauma-informed and person-centered approach RESPOND: address individual needs by coordinating across multidisciplinary stakeholders to deliver appropriate services\n\nWhat is human trafficking?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 Office on Trafficking in Persons describes human trafficking as \u201ca crime and public health concern that affects individuals, families, and communities across generations.\u201d Also referred to as \u201cmodern slavery\u201d, cases of human trafficking have been reported in all 50 states and individuals can be targeted for trafficking across any class, religious, cultural or ethnic group.\n\nThere are two types of trafficking in persons:\n\nLabor trafficking : individuals are compelled to work or provide services through the use of force, fraud or coercion.\n\n: individuals are compelled to work or provide services through the use of force, fraud or coercion. Sex trafficking: individuals are compelled to engage in commercial sex through the use of force, fraud or coercion. When a person under 18 years old is induced to perform a commercial sex act, it is a crime regardless of whether there is any force, fraud or coercion.\n\nWhat are the signs that someone may be experiencing trafficking?\n\nTrafficking can happen anywhere, from illicit markets to legal industries like agriculture, hospitality, construction or domestic services. While not all victims will show physical signs, the Office On Trafficking in Persons shares potential indicators:\n\nPhysical Health\n\nFrequent treatment for sexually transmitted infections\n\nHigh number of sexual partners\n\nMultiple pregnancies/abortions\n\nExposure to toxic chemicals\n\nDental issues\n\nBruising and burns\n\nSigns of self-harm\n\nWeight loss or malnourishment\n\nRespiratory issues\n\nSuicide attempts\n\nPhysical and sexual abuse\n\nBehavioral Health\n\nConfusing/contradicting stories\n\nInability to focus or concentrate\n\nUnaware of current date, location, or time\n\nProtects person who hurt them\n\nMinimizes abuse\n\nGuilt and shame about experiences\n\nSuicidal ideations\n\nExtreme timidity\n\nAggressive, antagonistic, or defensive\n\nHeightened stress response\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\n\nWithdrawn\n\nDepressed\n\nSocial/Environmental\n\nAbsent from school\n\nFailing grades\n\nSudden increase in substance use\n\nChange in dress\n\nAge-inappropriate romantic partner\n\nChange in friends\n\nRepeat runaway\n\nNot able to speak for oneself or share information\n\nEvidence of being controlled\n\nWears inappropriate clothing for the weather\n\nLives at worksite\n\nMultiple people in cramped living space\n\nHow can healthcare professionals step up in the fight against human trafficking?\n\nIt is estimated that 67.6% of individuals who have experienced trafficking encountered a healthcare professional during their trafficking experience.\n\nHealthcare providers play an important role in identifying and treating victims of trafficking. Often, victims of human trafficking suffer injuries or illnesses requiring visits with a clinician. These health issues include sexually transmitted diseases, physical injuries, burns, anxiety, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, depression, sexual violence, malnutrition, skin conditions and dental injuries. Survivors of human trafficking frequently require trauma-related mental health services.\n\nNHTTAC\u2019s SOAR framework is a trauma-informed, culturally and linguistically appropriate response to human trafficking. It provides a quick mental reference for our healthcare professionals to keep in mind the best way to help individuals who are at risk, currently experiencing or have experienced trafficking.\n\n\u201cBy equipping our caregivers and hospitals with accessible NHTTAC tools and training, we are providing a potential lifeline to human trafficking victims and survivors that access HCA Healthcare\u2019s facilities,\u201d said Wargo.\n\nAll courses in the SOAR Online curriculum are available to HCA Healthcare\u2019s more than 283,000 colleagues in HealthStream.\n\nWorking with community partners to fight human trafficking\n\nNo organization or sector can effectively fight human trafficking alone. It requires a community response. HCA Healthcare, the HCA Healthcare Foundation, and our colleagues are proud to partner with law enforcement, government, healthcare, business and community organizations to help ensure that every human has a chance to live free.\n\nA few examples of how HCA Healthcare affiliate hospitals are nurturing meaningful relationships with local community partners include:\n\nForensic nurse examiners at affiliate Mission Health in North Carolina are specially trained to provide comprehensive care for victims of human trafficking, sexual assault and abuse, domestic violence/intimate partner violence and physical assault. The nurse examiners lead a co-located clinic at the Buncombe County Family Justice Center. Mission Health sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) lead Jackie Maillet was recognized by the American Red Cross with a 2022 Western North Carolina Heroes Award for her role at the clinic and for bringing trauma-informed approaches to the emergency department.\n\nMission Health also partners with Our VOICE, a non-profit crisis intervention and prevention agency that serves as Buncombe County\u2019s anti-sexual violence and anti-human trafficking agency.\n\nFrom HCA Healthcare\u2019s headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, the HCA Healthcare Foundation supports the fight against human trafficking through grantmaking, sponsorships and volunteering. We have an active relationship with Thistle Farms, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing healing and hope to women survivors of trafficking, prostitution, and addiction. Another community organization that we partner with is End Slavery Tennessee, who advocates for human trafficking victims, educates communities across the state and the region, and informs legislators about the critical need to enact tougher laws so that traffickers are duly prosecuted.\n\nIn Wichita, Kansas affiliate Wesley Healthcare is working with Hope Ranch for Women, a nonprofit organization offering faith-based equine-assisted learning, mentoring and a residential home to empower and heal women who have been exploited and abused. A Wesley Healthcare nurse colleague has stepped up in the fight and regularly volunteers her time with the organization.\n\nIn Florida, HCA Florida Aventura Hospital has developed a local human trafficking program and HCA Florida JFK Hospital has helped to identify trafficking victims within an addiction stabilization unit.\n\nHelp and resources\n\nThe National Human Trafficking Hotline is a 24/7, confidential, multilingual hotline for victims, survivors and individuals with human trafficking concerns.\n\nCall: 1-888-373-7888\n\nText: \u201cBeFree\u201d (233733)\n\nLive chat: humantraffickinghotline.org", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "121870a1-e14b-4310-8c28-1c0aed81c73e", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

His dependence had escalated to 30 pills a day.\n\nMore than a year into his treatment with methadone, Lopez feels better than he has in years.\n\n\"My journey has been really very emotional and exhausting, and very mentally painful,\" Lopez said. \"But at the same time, it's been very rewarding in the sense that I truly feel like I've taken control of my life back.

More than 400,000 people take methadone as part of their addiction treatment for opioids.\n\nA major change in regulations surrounding methadone treatment allows for take-home doses. This shift is seen as a breakthrough in providing a more patient-centered approach. Methadone treatment once required individuals to visit clinics daily. Changes during the pandemic led to greater flexibility.\n\nCBS Colorado's Tori Mason interviews Jason Valderrama. CBS\n\nJason Valderrama, a medical provider at Community Medical Services, has been working in addiction medicine for seven years.\n\n\"When somebody is staying with us longer, and not coming in and starting treatment and stopping because the treatment demands are too high, we're going to see better success rates,\" said Valderrama. \"They're like, I thought I had to come in every day, and you're telling me I only have to come in three times a week? Like, that's doable.\"\n\nOld restrictions came from concerns that methadone would be abused or sold to other users. Research found the looser practices were safe. But patients must work up to it.\n\n\"You got to earn it, you know, like a trust kind of thing. You got to show that you're responsible with it,\" said Lopez.\n\nSince medicating at home, Lopez has more time to focus on his business and being a husband and father.\n\nWhile the support of the treatment system is crucial, Lopez says that recovery ultimately depends on your commitment to the process.\n\n\"Clinics can't get clean for you.

It wasn\u2019t until she began receiving methadone \u2014 coupled with therapy, 12-step meetings and other help \u2014 that she was finally able to escape heroin for good in 2009.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t touched opioids since then,\u201d she said.\n\nAtkins was fortunate. She had access to the evidence-based addiction treatment that research has shown is the best way to conquer the opioid epidemic roiling this country.\n\nIt\u2019s treatment that most Americans addicted to opioids don\u2019t receive, despite numerous studies showing medication-assisted treatment (MAT) helps people kick their illicit opioid habits and go back to living productive, law-abiding lives.\n\nBuprenorphine, commonly sold under the brand name Suboxone, is a synthetic opioid that reduces a patient\u2019s craving for opioids like heroin, fentanyl or OxyContin without giving them a high.\n\nIt also keeps users out of the torturous hell of physical withdrawal, often the downfall of many addicts\u2019 attempts to get clean and sober.\n\nBuprenorphine, approved for use in opioid addiction for two decades, has been shown to lower overdose deaths, reduce illicit drug use, slow the transmission of diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C, prevent relapse and help people stay in treatment.\n\nAfter years of opioid use, Lindsay Atkins was able to get sober with the help of medication-assisted treatment. Credit: Courtesy / Lindsay Atkins\n\nMethadone, which has been around even longer, is a long-acting opioid \u201cagonist\u201d that is used to control withdrawal safely. Another drug, naltrexone, blocks the high from opioids, helping deter future use.\n\nBut these life-saving and life-transforming medications are vastly underused in the United States, condemning untold numbers of people to lives of degradation and preventable deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of Americans continue to die of drug overdoses, which in 2022 once again topped 100,000 deaths, about 75% from opioids.\n\nI was drawn to this issue after reading a recent op-ed in the Washington Post by two physicians decrying the lack of access to buprenorphine and other forms of MAT. They wrote that these medicines are prescribed to fewer than 1 in 6 people who would benefit from them.\n\nThey placed a big part of the blame on the fact that most U.S. medical schools and residency programs don\u2019t provide enough training to young physicians regarding the treatment of addiction, including opioid use disorder.\n\nOne reason: Addiction medicine, they wrote, has been long neglected because of stigma \u2014 drug addicts are considered a challenging patient population, known for lying and manipulation \u2014 as well as other issues.\n\nI reached out to two psychiatrists who direct the largest medication-assisted treatment program in Bexar County to see if this national-level critique applies to facts on the ground here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally spot-on,\u201d said Dr. Rene Olvera, chief medical officer with the Center for Health Care Services.\n\nThe center\u2019s mostly state-funded ambulatory clinics (2023 budget: $5.3 million) provide buprenorphine and other MAT to some 600 patients at any one time, most of whom lack health insurance. This is just a fraction of the people who could benefit from the treatment, he said.\n\nDr. Rene Olvera is the chief medical officer for the Center for Health Care Services. Credit: Courtesy / Center for Health Care Services\n\n(There are also a number of for-profit MAT clinics and programs in San Antonio, which typically cater to those with insurance or cash to pay for their treatment.)\n\nOlvera said that when he started medical school in 1986, addiction treatment was a relatively new field. Over the last 30 years, it\u2019s been highly regulated, with opioid addiction medications categorized as Schedule 2 drugs, which means doctors have had to mount prescribing hurdles and maintain prodigious record-keeping.\n\n\u201cIt was onerous and a lot of physicians didn\u2019t want to bother with it,\u201d he said.\n\nOlvera\u2019s colleague Dr. Christopher Healey, who oversees the center\u2019s MAT program, said doctors have had to apply for a special waiver to prescribe MAT and go through specialized training.\n\n\u201cAnd because of the regulations, you could only treat a certain number of patients at any time, to guard against doctors overprescribing or creating \u2018pill mills,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nBoth physicians agreed with the op-ed that there hasn\u2019t been adequate training in medical schools, but there are other roadblocks that keep people from accessing the medicine that could save them.\n\nNamely, the expense: Buprenorphine can cost as much as about $300 a month, placing it out of reach for those who lack insurance or work a low-wage job. Even patients who have insurance may find the treatment not covered.\n\n\u201cFor many patients in this population, that amount of money is a real challenge,\u201d said Healey.\n\nThe stigma against treating addicts has lessened in recent years, said Olvera, as those in the medical community \u2014 and the public at large \u2014 have grown to see addiction as a chronic disease, not some moral failing or matter of personal \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\nBut compounding the problem is a shortage of psychiatrists, in Texas and elsewhere, which means there are not enough providers to do the prescribing.\n\n\u201cSome psychiatrists may feel they have enough to do dealing with patients who struggle with bipolar disorder, depression or other mental illnesses,\u201d said Olvera. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do the special training to treat this population. They would rather just refer to someone else, although the reality is people without insurance are not going to be referred in the first place.\u201d\n\nThings are slowly changing, the two physicians said.\n\nFor example, a one-year addiction training fellowship at UT Health San Antonio, which had lain fallow, is now drawing more applicants, said Healey, as doctors in training realize they\u2019ll be able to get jobs in addiction treatment once they\u2019re out of school.\n\n(It\u2019s a sort of paradoxical silver lining to the opioid epidemic, he said: The tidal wave of people suffering and dying is drawing more healers to the field.)\n\nPsychiatrists have become more open to non-psychiatrists prescribing MAT, broadening the level of access to the medications, said Olvera. And doctors are coming to understand that substance use disorder and mental illness are intricately interwoven diseases, to be treated concurrently, not as a \u201cchicken or egg\u201d situation, he said.\n\nPerhaps most important, this year President Joe Biden signed into law legislation that, among other things, will make buprenorphine more readily available to those seeking treatment.\n\nNow, physicians no longer will be required to get the special waiver to prescribe Suboxone and will be able to offer it to patients like any other medication.\n\nAlso, Congress has required all doctors to receive eight hours of education on substance use disorders before prescribing controlled substances. (It\u2019s still not enough training, said the op-ed authors.)\n\nProgress has happened locally, too, with programs like Be Well Texas through UT Health San Antonio, which started receiving funding in 2015.\n\nIn addition to conducting research in addiction treatment, providing training modules for physicians and distributing funding to community-based treatment organizations, the Be Well Texas Clinic offers comprehensive care, including MAT, to those seeking treatment, regardless of their ability to pay, via both in-person office visits and through virtual telehealth.\n\nIt\u2019s about time that attitudes are changing.\n\nTreatment with buprenorphine and methadone has been found to cut opioid overdose deaths in half when compared to behavioral therapy alone. MAT for opioid use disorder, especially when paired with therapy and other support, is far and away more effective than traditional programs based on abstinence.\n\nDr. Christopher Healey oversees the Center for Health Care Service\u2019s medication-assisted treatment program. Credit: Courtesy / Center for Health Care Services\n\nProviding recovering addicts with MAT on an outpatient basis is both more effective and cheaper than adding inpatient beds at rehabilitation centers, other research shows.\n\nStill, resistance to evidence-based MAT remains. Outdated beliefs that such treatment entails \u201cjust trading one addiction for another\u201d persist in the wider culture.\n\nMany residential or outpatient drug treatment centers in Texas and elsewhere don\u2019t offer it, despite its being available for decades. The folks who run many programs may view such medication as a \u201ccrutch,\u201d despite studies that show MAT is more successful at keeping people in treatment than abstinence-based approaches.\n\nSome folks in 12-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous may look down their noses at recovered addicts who use these medicines, going so far as to say they\u2019re not truly sober, because they\u2019re not 100% abstinent. Some sober-living homes and work programs reportedly have rejected people on methadone or other MAT, saying they aren\u2019t \u201crecovered.\u201d\n\nThese mindsets are absurd, bordering on the criminal.\n\nThanks to stubborn stigmas, one study showed it\u2019s far easier to get access to the drugs that started the U.S. opioid epidemic than it is to get help.\n\nNo, MAT isn\u2019t a complete magic pill. Some people relapse on it. It\u2019s not enough by itself: Recovering addicts on MAT need therapy, fellowship and other support to combat the isolation and disconnection that is so much a part of addiction.\n\nAnd, yes, some patients may be on MAT for the rest of their lives. But isn\u2019t that better than dying in an alley, with a needle stuck in your arm?\n\nLast month, Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law measures to combat the fentanyl crisis, including increased penalties for producing and selling it, greater access to the anti-overdose medication Narcan and new programs to increase awareness about the drug\u2019s dangers.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but until we can increase access to the medications that stop people from using illicit opioids in the first place, residents of this state will continue to die.\n\nAtkins, today a human resources manager in San Antonio and single mother to her 15-year-old son, no longer takes methadone. She stays sober by immersing herself in her recovery community. But without MAT, her story could have ended far differently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I would have kept doing heroin,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t be alive today.\u201d", "source_domain": "sanantonioreport.org", "article_id": "f422d10a-a4ab-4836-be5d-d95a298d7bdf", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

In Colorado, the cost is not covered for patients on Medicaid.\n\nMaria Casillas of Commerce City is one patient who wouldn't be able to get this treatment if it wasn't for the clinic.\n\nTMS uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain associated with mood regulation, which Casillas says has been a game changer for her.\n\n\"I feel a lot better than how I was feeling,\" Casillas said in Spanish.\n\nMaria Casillas CBS\n\nAfter trying out countless antidepressants and even Spravato, she had lost hope she would ever overcome her depression. It wasn't until she tried TMS that she quickly began to see changes in her mood.\n\n\"I've done other treatments and they have not worked as much as this has,\" Casillas said.\n\nThe non-invasive treatment is nearly 80% effective in patients, though a downside could be the price tag, especially for those without insurance or on Medicaid.\n\nAxis co-founder Liesl Perez believes in making a difference by providing care to people in underserved communities.\n\n\"Our clinic, since we started, has written off $300,000 of free mental health care to patients who really needed it the most,\" Perez said.\n\nThe clinic opened its doors in 2020 and has now expanded to three clinics in total, Aurora, Westminster and Louisville.\n\n\"For the populations that we are serving, that is extremely important,\" Perez said. \"People do not realize they can afford mental health care, they do not know how to navigate the system.\"\n\nServing patients like Casillas at no cost offering TMS therapy through its' pro bono program.\n\n\"It was like a miracle,\" she said. \"I couldn't believe this treatment would be free for me, until now.\"\n\nThrough this program, the clinic aims to increase health equity, especially among people in minority communities who face barriers to mental health services.\n\n\"We are healing family systems and we are healing lots of generational traumas that comes with mental illness,\" Perez said.\n\nTMS therapy is currently covered by eighteen state Medicaid programs, though Colorado is not one of them, this clinic aims to help those seeking the therapy regardless of their insurance plan.", "source_domain": "www.cbsnews.com", "article_id": "d58f603d-de65-478f-87d4-75a3452dd4c4", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Here\u2019s what you should know.", "published_at": "2018-06-26T00:00:00", "full_text": "It\u2019s official. Video game addiction, or \u201cgaming,\u201d has been added to the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) list of mental health conditions. The disorder was added last week to WHO\u2019s disease classification manual, which identifies health trends.\n\nAudrey Nottke, director of nursing over behavioral health services at The Medical Center of Aurora, told the local Fox affiliate in Denver that she believes this is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cRight now we are seeing people spend up to 16 hours a day just playing on these video games, so this allows them to reach out for help,\u201d Nottke said.\n\nSome experts believe labeling \u201cgaming\u201d as a diagnosis is a bit premature.\n\n\u201cThe behavioral health community is governed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5),\u201d Nottke explained. \u201cCurrently, the DSM refers to internet gaming disorder as a \u2018condition for further study\u2019. However, I can safely say that behavioral health experts recognize all addictions and are supportive of any individual who reaches out to get help for a gaming disorder.\u201d\n\nIf parents are struggling to control the amount of time their child spends in front of a screen, here\u2019s what they should know about the newest mental health condition.\n\nWhat is gaming disorder?\n\nGaming Disorder involves playing digital or video games to an excessive extent. According to WHO, there are three characteristics that define this disorder, including,\n\nimpaired control over gaming,\n\nincreasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that the gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and\n\ncontinuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences\n\nWhat criteria does one have to meet to be considered as having the disorder?\n\nContext is important when considering the criteria. However, if someone can answer yes to five of the following items within one year that might indicate an addiction:\n\nPreoccupation or obsession with Internet games.\n\nFeeling restless when not playing Internet games.\n\nCraving more time playing the games.\n\nThe person has tried to stop or curb playing Internet games, but has failed to do so.\n\nThe person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies.\n\nA person has had continued overuse of Internet games even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person\u2019s life.\n\nThe person lied to others about his or her Internet game usage.\n\nThe person uses Internet games to relieve anxiety or guilt\u2013it\u2019s a way to escape.\n\nThe person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of Internet games.\n\nGaming has started to interfere with job/school performance.\n\nFeeling guilty or depressed about gaming.\n\nWhy do people choose gaming?\n\nIt offers:\n\na temporary escape,\n\nconstant measurable growth,\n\nimmediate feedback,\n\na challenge, and\n\nsocial status, which is dependent on how well the individual plays the game. One\u2019s status can improve quickly in gaming, which may not be the case outside of the game.\n\nHow to recognize gaming condition?\n\nIf a loved one starts:\n\nlosing interest in being socially active outside of the internet game,\n\nno longer attends to various responsibilities (i.e. school, work, relationships), or\n\nthe person lies to others about his or her Internet game usage.\n\nWhat can individuals do to replace gaming?\n\nMy recommendation is to encourage that person to learn a different hobby that involves other individuals. Activities like board games, sports or playing in a band are ideal. Also, there are a ton of great suggestions on the Game Quitters website here.\n\nWhat are some resources people can go to for help?\n\nAnyone who might need assistance for a gaming addiction can contact their local healthcare provider for evaluation and treatment. Individuals can also contact the substance abuse and mental health services administration\u2019s national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Help is also available at treatment centers that specialize in video game addictions, such as Cottonwood Tucson or reSTART.\n\nAudrey Nottke serves as the director of nursing over behavioral health services at HealthONE\u2019s The Medical Center of Aurora, an affiliate of HCA Healthcare.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "87596deb-7763-4776-8cd4-342ffceff979", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Still, the Longhorns hit the ground running as the new-look team prepares for the defending national champion Ohio State Buckeyes in 31 days.\n\n\n\nSteve Sarkisian spoke with the media following practice and he was buzzing about several players\u2019 performances. One in particular is Cal tight end transfer, Jack Endries. The Texas coach called him \u201ccerebral and a team-first player\u201d.\n\n\n\nOne of the newest players in the burnt orange, Endries is fresh off a fantastic 2024 campaign where he caught 56 passes for 623 yards and two touchdowns. As a redshirt freshman, he caught 35 passes for 408 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\n\nEndries, who will be a redshirt junior in 2025, has two seasons of eligibility remaining.\n\nOct 12, 2024; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; California Golden Bears tight end Jack Endries (87) runs after a catch as Pittsburgh Panthers defensive back Rashad Battle (15) chases during the fourth quarter at Acrisure Stadium. Pittsburgh won 17-15. Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-Imagn Images\n\nLast season, the Texas Longhorns leaned quite a bit on tight end Gunnar Helm.\n\nAfter a modest couple seasons, the Tennessee Titans draft pick had a breakout season in 2024. He hauled in 60 receptions for 786 yards and seven touchdowns. Helm set school single-season records last year for receptions (60) and yards (786) by a Texas tight end.\n\n\n\nWell, now he\u2019s gone and Sarkisian wet out west to California to find Arch Manning a safety blanket. The Longhorns head coach also noted he wants Endries \u201cto do things the right way, especially when the offense is new to him\u201d.\n\n\n\nEndries is a fantastic blend of a pass-catching tight end who can extend drives. He can also stick his nose in there and block for you on running and passing downs. The latter being crucial as Texas breaks in four new starters on the offensive line and a new quarterback under center.\n\nI expect for Manning and Endries to continue to build chemistry as we count down to the season opener at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio August 30.\n\n\n\n", "source_domain": "atozsports.com", "article_id": "de9a4791-946c-4f94-afdc-b57491d742a9", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOfficials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.\n\nMuch of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.\n\nThat includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.\n\nFederal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.\n\nThe workforce at SAMHSA dropped to a low of 376 employees in 2020, according to records tallied by the Partnership for Public Service, down from a high of 553 in 2014.\n\nOver the same time, survey scores of employee satisfaction at SAMHSA dropped to a record low of 27 out of 100, far below the average for federal agencies.\n\nEmployee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.\n\nMost federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.\n\nAgencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.\n\nSome agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.\n\nIt is not clear how many total workers were ultimately cut from HHS.\n\nAt SAMHSA, officials remaining at the agency said the firings were frustrating, undoing hard-won hires in some cases for needed positions.\n\nOne health official warned of a repeat from the \"doom loop\" that plagued the agency during the first Trump administration, where most of the highest performing workers fled SAMHSA for jobs in the private sector, feeding a drop in morale.\n\nSome staff remained because they were committed to public service, the official said. But many others remained because they were stuck in their jobs at SAMHSA, either because of personal circumstances or because they were unable to get hired elsewhere.\n\n\"Last time it took them two or three years to induce the doom loop.

It summarizes the key points discussed, but for full details and context, please refer to the video of the full meeting. Link to Full Meeting\n\nPlus: Ask questions about this article.\n\nIn a recent McKinney ISD school board meeting, discussions centered around the implementation of a new law regulating cell phone use in schools, reflecting a growing concern for student mental health and classroom focus. The board acknowledged the challenges posed by technology in educational settings, particularly the distractions caused by cell phones.\n\n\n\nSuperintendent Dr. Winters reported a mixed response from the community regarding the new regulations, noting that initial feedback was roughly split between support and concern. However, he mentioned that since the law's implementation, there has been little ongoing feedback from parents, suggesting a possible acceptance of the changes.\n\n\n\nThe board members discussed the potential benefits of limiting cell phone access during school hours, citing research that indicates reduced screen time can positively impact students' emotional and psychological well-being. They highlighted that many educators have observed improved focus in classrooms since the policy took effect, with teachers reporting a noticeable shift in student engagement.\n\n\n\nWhile some board members expressed concerns about the balance between parental rights and school regulations, they ultimately agreed on the necessity of the law for enhancing student safety and concentration. The decision to keep cell phones out of sight but accessible in emergencies was seen as a compromise to address safety concerns while minimizing distractions.\n\n\n\nThe board unanimously approved the motion to adhere to the new law, marking a significant step in McKinney ISD's efforts to foster a more conducive learning environment. As the school year progresses, the district will continue to monitor the impact of these regulations on student behavior and academic performance, aiming to support both educational goals and student well-being.\n\n\n\nConverted from McKinney ISD, TX - School Board Meeting meeting on August 18, 2025\n\nLink to Full Meeting", "source_domain": "citizenportal.ai", "article_id": "42052df7-875d-4575-aad6-4267ef41a974", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

{"url": "https://bioengineer.org/cu-anschutz-study-finds-smartphone-app-reduces-repeat-suicide-attempts-by-more-than-50-following-hospital-discharge/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "In a groundbreaking advancement for mental health care, researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Yale School of Medicine, and The Ohio State University have unveiled compelling evidence demonstrating the efficacy of a smartphone-delivered digital therapeutic in significantly reducing the rate of repeated suicide attempts among high-risk patients. Published in the esteemed JAMA Network Open on August 8, 2025, this large-scale randomized clinical trial highlights the potential of technology-driven interventions to fill critical gaps in traditional psychiatric care, especially during vulnerable periods post-hospital discharge.\n\nThe study focuses on a phase of psychiatric care often plagued by elevated risk: the weeks immediately following inpatient hospitalization for suicidal ideation or attempts. During this postoperative window, patients commonly experience resurgence of suicidal thoughts, a pattern attributable both to abrupt transitions in care continuity and systemic healthcare limitations. This research sought to determine whether a structured digital intervention could provide timely, personalized therapeutic support when human resources are most strained and patients most isolated.\n\nThe centerpiece of this investigation was OTX-202, a smartphone application developed by Oui Therapeutics, designed to deliver a series of 12 concise, interactive lessons. Each module is engineered to impart cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) techniques, focusing on emotional regulation, safety planning, and crisis management. Patients initiated the intervention during their inpatient stay and continued engagement autonomously post-discharge, complementing standard psychiatric treatment and outpatient follow-up.\n\n.adsslot_X1SkY8j5mK{width:728px !important;height:90px !important;}\n\n@media(max-width:1199px){ .adsslot_X1SkY8j5mK{width:468px !important;height:60px !important;}\n\n}\n\n@media(max-width:767px){ .adsslot_X1SkY8j5mK{width:320px !important;height:50px !important;}\n\n}\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMethodologically, 339 adult patients across six major medical centers\u2014including UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, Yale New Haven Hospital, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, the Menninger Clinic, Western Psychiatric Hospital, and Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services\u2014were enrolled and randomized to receive either OTX-202 or an active control app providing general mental health support absent of targeted therapeutic content. This robust multi-site design enhanced the generalizability of findings and minimized site-specific confounders.\n\nThe trial revealed that among patients with a documented history of suicide attempts, those assigned to OTX-202 demonstrated a remarkable 58.3% reduction in recurrent suicide attempts compared to controls. Furthermore, these patients exhibited sustained alleviation of suicidal ideation extending up to 24 weeks following hospital discharge\u2014a significant temporal improvement over the control group, whose initial gains in mood and cognition deteriorated by the same endpoint. These results underscore the durability of effect and signal the app\u2019s role in stabilizing mental health during critical transitional periods.\n\nCrucially, the digital therapeutic harnesses evidenced-based psychotherapeutic frameworks while capitalizing on mobile technology\u2019s ubiquity. The intervention\u2019s design reflects an appreciation for cognitive load considerations and digital engagement strategies, ensuring users encounter intuitive interfaces, digestible lesson formats, and motivational feedback loops to encourage adherence. This blend of clinical rigor and user-centered design responds directly to adherence challenges endemic to digital mental health tools.\n\nExperts involved in the study emphasize that tools like OTX-202 are not intended to supplant face-to-face psychiatric care but serve as an adjunct during high-risk intervals where in-person support is limited. Dr. Michael Allen, lead co-author and psychiatry professor at CU Anschutz, highlights this paradigm shift, stating, \u201cDigital interventions introduced at critical moments can provide continuous, real-time support tailored to individual needs, enhancing resilience against suicidal crises.\u201d This philosophy aligns with emerging models advocating for stepped and integrated care pathways utilizing digital therapeutics.\n\nThe public health implications of such findings are profound, given that suicide remains among the leading causes of death in the United States, with recorded rates increasing by over 30% since 1999. With more than half a million individuals hospitalized annually following suicide attempts, scalable, accessible interventions that can augment existing treatment frameworks offer a promising avenue to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population.\n\nFrom a neuropsychiatric perspective, the app\u2019s content directly targets dysregulated neural circuits implicated in emotional dyscontrol and impulsivity, which are core contributors to suicidal behavior. By reinforcing cognitive restructuring, distress tolerance skills, and proactive safety planning, the intervention aims to modulate the behavioral phenotypes underpinning suicidality. This mechanistic targeting, coupled with the app\u2019s availability during critical post-discharge phases, represents a significant stride in personalized mental health care.\n\nWhile the research heralds a new frontier in digital mental health, it also acknowledges challenges including user engagement variability, potential for digital fatigue, and issues of equity in access to smartphones and reliable internet connections. Future development will likely focus on adaptive algorithms that personalize content delivery based on user response patterns, integrating biometric data, and expanding accessibility to underserved populations.\n\nIn conclusion, this pioneering clinical trial marks a transformative moment in suicide prevention, illustrating the potent synergy between behavioral science and digital innovation. By extending therapeutic reach beyond physical clinical settings, OTX-202 exemplifies the potential of technology to save lives and reshape mental health paradigms. As the mental health community grapples with escalating demand and resource constraints, interventions like these offer scalable, evidence-based solutions tailor-made for the digital age.\n\nSubject of Research: People\n\nArticle Title: A Digital Therapeutic Intervention for Inpatients With Elevated Suicide Risk\n\nNews Publication Date: August 19, 2025\n\nWeb References:\n\nUniversity of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus: https://www.cuanschutz.edu/\n\nOui Therapeutics: https://ouitherapeutics.com/\n\nJAMA Network Open article: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837367\n\nKeywords: Psychiatry, Behavioral psychology\n\nTags: cognitive behavioral therapy via appdialectical behavior therapy smartphone applicationdigital therapeutics for mental healthimpactful mental health research findingsinnovative therapies for psychiatric caremental health interventions for high-risk patientspsychiatric care post-hospital dischargerandomized clinical trial on suicide preventionreducing repeat suicide attemptssmartphone app for suicide preventiontechnology in mental health treatmenttransition care for suicidal patients", "source_domain": "bioengineer.org", "article_id": "ceac4656-7b38-4a0c-a2cf-6691193eb32b", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

So why don't you brush your teeth,\" McAuliffe suggests.\n\n\"Okay,\" replies Aiden.\n\n\"Thanks,\" she says.\n\nGrowing up in Steamboat Springs, McAuliffe started ski racing when she was a kid. This eventually led to freestyle snowboarding, competing in the halfpipe and multiple injuries.\n\n\"Broken ankles, broken wrist, broken ribs, dislocations,\" she said. \"So, I was put on prescription painkillers pretty much at age 16 to 18.\"\n\nWhen McAuliffe could no longer get Percocet, OxyContin or Hydrocodone from doctors, she started using heroin. Throughout her drug use, McAuliffe had several stints in rehab, but couldn't stay sober. After her second overdose, she decided to try medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT combines medications and behavioral therapy to treat substance use disorders.\n\nBut two years ago, McAuliffe would not have been able to get MAT in Steamboat Springs.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Nancy Best, executive director of Road to Recovery, meets with patient Jonathan Perez. \u201cI feel like I got my life,\u201d says Perez about the medication-assisted treatment services he receives at the facility.\n\nA block off Lincoln Ave, Steamboat's main street, is a Victorian house built in 1912. The bright yellow building with purple trim is home to Mountain Medical Road to Recovery. It's the first integrated addiction medication and behavioral health clinic providing MAT services in Routt County. Before it opened in 2018, people struggling with opioid use disorder had to travel to Grand Junction or Denver for treatment.\n\n\"We came here to try to stop people from dying from overuse of prescribed opiates or from heroin,\" said Nancy Best, executive director of Road to Recovery.\n\nIn 2016, 19 people died of opioid overdoses in Routt County. That's why it and Pueblo County, which also had a high overdose rate, were selected for a new pilot program approved by the state legislature in 2017.\n\nThe Medication-assisted Treatment Pilot Program expanded access to MAT to opioid-dependent patients in Routt and Pueblo counties. Over the course of two years, the program provided $500,000 in grants for to community and office-based practices, behavioral health organizations and substance abuse treatment organizations. Three facilities were selected for the grant, including Road to Recovery.\n\nThe pilot program, administered by the College of Nursing at the University of Colorado Anschutz, had two goals. The first was to increase access to MAT services and medications which include methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone.\n\n\"Those are either medications that help you to not go into withdrawal and help to rebalance the chemical imbalance in your brain that may happen when you have an opioid use disorder,\" said Tanya Sorrell, an associate professor at the College of Nursing, who helped oversee the grants.\n\nThe second goal was to increase the number of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who tend to practice in rural areas, according to Sorrell.\n\nThe two-year pilot program has been a success. Between the two counties, over 700 people have been treated and 10 additional nurse practitioners and physician assistants received their waivers from the Drug Enforcement Agency to prescribe MAT.\n\nIn May, Gov. Polis signed a bill extending the pilot program for two more years. It was expanded to include the San Luis Valley and two other counties that demonstrate a need for MAT services. The funding was increased to $2.5 million.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Tanya Sorrell is an assistant professor at the College of Nursing at the University of Colorado Anschutz. The college administered the Medication-assisted Treatment Pilot Program created by the state legislature in 2017. This May, Gov. Polis signed a bill expanding the program and extending it for another two years.\n\nIn April 2018, Best prescribed McAuliffe Suboxone. Suboxone, which is a brand name for buprenorphine/naloxone, is known as a partial opioid agonist. It's a partial opioid and the effect is weaker than full agonists like heroin and methadone. But after using Suboxone for awhile, McAuliffe no longer wanted to take an opioid-based medication.\n\nShe decided to switch to Vivitrol, a long-acting injectable form of naltrexone, another MAT medication. Unlike Suboxone, Vivitrol is an antagonist and blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and the euphoric effects of drugs like heroin.\n\n\"With Vivitrol, you can't abuse it and it's not an opiate,\" said McAuliffe. \"I just wanted to be 100% clean from all drugs.\"\n\nBut changing medications wasn't easy. Since Vivitrol blocks opioids, a patient needs to be sober for eight days before taking it. The problem: McAuliffe was on Suboxone, a partial opioid. Best did not want her to abruptly stop using that medication, then wait more than a week to get on Vivitrol, and McAuliffe couldn't quickly switch from drug to the other.\n\n\"Suboxone is a partial opioid agonist, meaning it's sitting on that receptor,\" Best said. \"If I give her naltrexone or a Vivitrol shot, it's going to kick that off the receptor and she's going to be sicker than she ever has been.\"\n\nSo Best, who is a physician assistant and certified addiction counselor, got creative. She cross tapered two medications over eight days, decreasing the Suboxone while increasing the oral Naltrexone dosage. Then McAuliffe was able to get a Vivitrol shot.\n\n\"I was honest. I just told Ashley (McAuliffe) you're going to be the first one.\"\n\nBest's experiment worked and McAuliffe received her first Vivitrol shot in December 2018. Since then, she gets the injection every 28 days.\n\nVivitrol and Naltrexone are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat opioid use disorders and alcohol use disorders. But over a year ago, Best started using the medication to treat another type of drug addiction: methamphetamine.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Melinda McDowell was the first patient at Road to Recovery in Steamboat Springs to be prescribed Naltrexone and Vivitrol for methamphetamine addiction.\n\nDuring the spring of 2018, Melinda McDowell spent her days on her bathroom floor, smoking crystal meth.\n\n\"I was tweaking pretty hard. I was hallucinating so bad,\" she said.\n\nHer husband was away in Japan and her two youngest kids had been taken into foster care due to her heavy drug use, which had spanned more than two decades. One day, McDowell looked in a mirror and decided to quit.\n\n\"I knew I looked like crap and I knew that I had to stop, otherwise I was going to die,\" she said.\n\nA friend, who McDowell met in a recovery program, had given her the number for Road to Recovery. McDowell said she called Best, begging for help.\n\nBest had never prescribed a MAT medication for methamphetamine addiction before but knew research on the effects of naltrexone and Vivitrol existed. The first drug had shown more positive results than the second.\n\nSo Best initially prescribed naltrexone. She said McDowell called within an hour of taking the medication and was ecstatic.\n\n\"Sure enough it just, my body started relaxing,\" McDowell said, \"I started feeling relief and the withdrawal and the cravings were going away.\"\n\nBut naltrexone is a daily pill and Best wasn't sure if McDowell could maintain the strict schedule. So, she put McDowell on Vivitrol too. She's been taking both medications for over a year.\n\n\"It's a miracle. It's a miracle. Um, I should not be sitting here today. I should be dead, but Nancy literally saved my life,\" McDowell said.\n\nMcDowell, 45, is getting her life back together. She's filed an appeal to regain custody of her kids and is studying to become a certified addiction counselor. McDowell goes to regular group meetings and counseling sessions at Road to Recovery. She has developed a sober support network.\n\n\"We've got our awesome community of people that we're just so tight and close,\" McDowell said. \"I've referred people who've referred people, who've referred people.\"\n\nBut despite the success of Road to Recovery and the MAT program, McDowell said some people in the recovery community believe in abstinence only. Using medication, she said, comes with a stigma.\n\n\"A lot of the people at the NA (Narcotics Anonymous) groups, they looked down upon us because they say, 'Oh, well you're still taking legal drugs,'\" said McDowell. \"But this is non-addictive. It can't get you high. The only thing it does is give you, it's like a crutch. It helps you stay sober. I mean I don't understand why people just don't get it.\"\n\nMcDowell has struggled with addiction for over 30 years. She said, if necessary, she'll take naltrexone and Vivitrol for the rest of her life.\n\nSince treating McDowelll, Best has prescribed the medications to treat other patients dealing with methamphetamine and alcohol addictions.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Ashley McAuliffe is a manager at an upscale grocery store in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. She receives a Vivitrol injection once a month to treat her opioid use disorder.\n\nAbout three miles from Road to Recovery, McAuliffe cuts a large submarine sandwich into smaller pieces to be individually wrapped and sold. She's a manager at an upscale grocery store at the base of the ski mountain.\n\n\"I feel great overall. Just working hard, exercising hard, you know,\" McAuliffe said. \"More available for my kiddo.\"\n\nLike McDowell, she's also finishing up a program to become a certified addiction counselor. McAuliffe wants to help others who struggle with substance use disorders. But she remains focused on her own sobriety.\n\n\"I always have that fear of relapse,\" McAuliffe said. \"I think I'm going to stay on Vivitrol for a year to two years and that's a good safety net for me.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct which two medications Nancy Best cross tapered Ashley McAuliffe between.", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org", "article_id": "5b34ddc3-3323-466d-9baa-768b5883a649", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Practice size (number of providers) was associated with differences in conditions that provided sufficient aspects for MAT provision. Small (1\u20132 medical providers), non-private practices benefited from the presence of behavioral health and a clinician with MAT experience. Medium sized practices (3\u20135 providers) whether private or not benefited from behavioral health, often in combination with a clinician with MAT experience. In large practices (6 or more providers), behavioral health was not a factor while having a clinician with MAT experience mattered half of the time.\n\nMethods: Mixed methods study using qualitative and quantitative data collected from interviews, observations, surveys, and practice-reported data. Participants were staff members from 35 rural primary care practices in Colorado, United States. We qualitatively analyzed the data, then transformed the data, then analyzed it using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA).\n\nPurpose: Opioid dependence and use disorders (OUDs) are serious public health crises resulting in a rising number of opioid-related deaths. Medication assisted treatment (MAT), in this case treatment with buprenorphine, is an evidence-based solution to combatting OUD; however, MAT has been largely unavailable in rural areas. This study investigated what it took to increase MAT in rural Colorado primary care practices.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe opioid epidemic is a major public health problem in the United States (1, 2). Treatment for OUD with buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist at the mu-opiate receptor), naltrexone (an opioid antagonist), or methadone (a synthetic opioid that acts as a full agonist), frequently referred to as medication assisted treatment (MAT), is an effective, evidence-based approach (3, 4). However, only 25% of U.S. adults with OUD receive MAT (5).\n\nEfforts to close this treatment gap, save lives, and improve the quality of life for individuals and communities include engaging primary care, where Americans receive about half of all their health care (6, 7). Primary care practice has been considered a potential mitigator of OUD with their ability to screen, diagnose, and treat patients by a single clinical team (8). MAT can occur in outpatient settings (9) and can leverage existing chronic disease management models embraced by primary care. Prior to 2023, a primary care clinician was required to obtain a DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder. Obtaining the waiver required 8 h of approved training. Once trained, the DEA offered an \u201cX\u201d waiver that allowed the primary care clinician to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. More recently, to increase access to buprenorphine, this waiver has been eliminated so that all clinicians with a DEA license can prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Unfortunately, the implementation of MAT in primary care has been slow, with barriers including misconceptions about the patients needing treatment, stigma, and lack of trained staff (10\u201313). While the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 eliminated the federal requirement for clinicians to have a special waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD (14), this waiver requirement previously acted as another barrier to MAT implementation (11, 15, 16). Following the trend in other states, only 54% of clinicians in Colorado who had a DEA waiver wrote a buprenorphine prescription that was filled in 2016 and 2017. Further, only 8% of waivered clinicians were located in rural Colorado counties, although rural counties experience the highest rates of drug overdose deaths (6, 17). The literature is silent on why exactly this is the case but this may be potentially due to the overall shortage of medical and behavioral health clinicians in rural areas.\n\nImplementing Technology and Medication Assisted Treatment Team Training in Rural Colorado (IT MATTTRs) is a partnership of researchers, community members, and MAT experts convened to address the OUD crisis in rural Colorado. In Colorado 12 counties have overdose death rates of more than 20 per 100,000 and are among the highest in the nation; seven of these counties are located in the region where IT MATTTRs was implemented (18). IT MATTTRs is a practice and community intervention to improve knowledge and awareness of OUD and increase access to buprenorphine treatment for OUD in rural Colorado primary care practices. Started in 2016 when waivers were still required for OUD treatment with buprenorphine, IT MATTTRs included an evidence-based practice team training on OUD treatment with buprenorphine tailored to rural primary care practices (19\u201323). Although naltrexone and methadone are also evidence-based MAT, this project focused on buprenorphine because it can be prescribed in primary care. Administering methadone must be done at a Certified Opioid Treatment Program, which are not accessible in our rural study region, and the long withdrawal period of naltrexone was not appealing to clinicians participating in the IT MATTTRs study. For these reasons, this study supported the use of treatment with buprenorphine.\n\nRecognizing the challenges and complexity of organizational change in primary care practices (24), we used Qualitative Comparison Analysis (QCA), a novel analytic method, to conduct a rigorous exploration of the key factors needed to increase the provision of MAT to patients in practices receiving the IT MATTTRs Team Training. This paper describes the results of QCA based on our qualitative and other data collected. Our results build on reports of barriers and contribute to detailed understanding of successful implementation of MAT in rural primary care practices.\n\nMethods\n\nWe obtained approval from the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board to conduct this work. This project was supported by grant number R18HS025065 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).\n\nIT MATTTRs interventions\n\nThe IT MATTTRs study included community-focused interventions (22) and opportunities for clinicians (physicians and advance practice providers) to complete training and obtain the previously-required DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD. The program also provided training to practice teams in rural Colorado to enhance understanding of OUD and OUD treatment and facilitate the implementation of MAT. The training covered the epidemiology of OUD, pharmacology of buprenorphine, neurobiology of addiction, and detailed MAT steps. Forty-two practices were randomly assigned to receive training via the in-person Shared Onsite kNowledge Dissemination (SOuND) Team Training\u2122 model (n = 24) or an Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) tele-health model (n = 18). Described in detail elsewhere (20), the training was offered to all staff and clinicians at participating practices.\n\nSetting and participants\n\nForty-two out of approximately 80 total primary care practices from two regions of Colorado, the eastern plains area (served by the High Plains Research Network, or HPRN) and the San Luis Valley (served by the Colorado Research Network, or CaReNet), participated in the IT MATTTRs study and received the IT MATTTRs Practice Team Training. All practices were in a 24-county region located entirely in rural areas, and 13 of the counties have frontier designation (fewer than 6 people per square mile); combined, this study region geographically covers 37% of the state of Colorado. All counties are designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (25). See Table 1 for a list of available primary and behavioral health resources in study region.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Primary and behavioral health resources in study region.\n\nParticipants in this evaluation included a variety of practice member roles including at least one medical provider (physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant), one clinical staff member (usually a medical assistant or clinical supervisor) and, if possible, other roles such as behavioral health provider, practice manager, or health educator/care coordinator. Baseline interviews were conducted in 42 practices and follow-up interviews were completed in 35. Two to five individuals were interviewed per practice, depending on the practice size. The IT MATTTRs Practice Team Training reached 441 team members across all practices and roles (out of an eligible 676 individuals) and a total of 108 interviews were completed across all practices. While all members of the participating practice teams were encouraged to attend the team training, some individuals missed the training due to scheduling obligations or staff turnover; however, all interviewees were familiar with the IT MATTTRs study and their practice\u2019s involvement in it.\n\nData collection and instruments\n\nThe data for this evaluation was collected from a variety of IT MATTTRs data sources including baseline observations, MAT Implementation Checklist at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-intervention, and interviews at baseline and 6 months post-intervention. We conducted observations at each practice at baseline (pre-intervention), which captured information such as the physical layout and space, medical record procedure, work teams, and practice atmosphere. The MAT Implementation Checklist was completed by either a clinician or practice manager and measured the level of MAT implementation using a 26-item checklist, at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after the practice team training. Demographic data were collected from individual practice team members who participated in the qualitative interviews using a short survey (age, gender, race/ethnicity and length of time in the profession and at the practice).\n\nWe developed a semi-structured interview guide to determine practice member perceptions and current practices regarding opioid use, OUD, and OUD treatment. The baseline interview guide covered the practice member role, current practices and protocols in managing patients with both regular opioid use and OUD, and goals, concerns and intentions regarding providing MAT to patients in their practice. Follow-up interviews (held after intervention completion) included the same topics as well as practices\u2019 experiences with the intervention and their current procedures and future plans regarding MAT. Interviews lasted 30\u201360 min each and were conducted by a study team member either in person or by telephone. All interviews were conducted either by a doctorally-trained qualitative researcher or other study team members trained and supervised by that qualitative researcher. Study team members practiced with interviews until they demonstrated competency. Participants were compensated with a gift card. A memo form was completed immediately after each interview to capture key summary points and reflections. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and loaded into ATLAS.ti version 8 (ATLAS.ti GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Baseline interviews and observations were conducted between July, 2017, and September, 2018, and results are reported elsewhere (21). Follow-up interviews were conducted between November, 2018, and January, 2020.\n\nAnalysis\n\nApproach\n\nFor analyzing the baseline data, we used a grounded hermeneutic editing approach (26). This approach is similar to a grounded theory approach but includes editing as an \u201corganizing style of analysis that helps bring forth greater understanding of or meaning from text or data\u201d (26). For the qualitative analysis considering both the baseline and follow-up interview data and other sources of data, we used a variation of a rapid qualitative analysis approach (27\u201329).\n\nData sources and practice template creation\n\nIn this process, we created a summary template for each practice (see Supplementary material S1). The template covered: practice information, OUD and MAT experience, resources including behavioral health, opioid prescribing procedures, and evidence of diversion (i.e., if interview participants described examples of diversion, or sharing medications with others not prescribed), or inherited prescribing (i.e., assuming opioid prescriptions for inherited patients) as captured in the interviews. An qualitative core team member completed the template after reviewing all the data sources for each practice. The data sources included all the baseline and follow-up interview transcripts, the observation field notes, the fidelity checklist (for MAT provision or referral system), and surveys (for practice demographics).\n\nNext, another core team member checked over the completed template using the same data sources. Any discrepancies were discussed and rectified, which sometimes required revisiting the data and considering new categories on the template for summarization. After a summary template was completed for each practice, overall summaries across practices were considered.\n\nSummary template creation\n\nThen the team discussed the convergence of these summaries noting areas of overlaps and divergence. The team considered the meaning and relevance of results emerging from the data. These data were presented to the larger research team for discussion and feedback, then refined and finalized for consistency and implementation considerations. These efforts allowed the core team to revisit the data, confirm, modify, or refute initial impressions, and identify additional areas for further analysis. Throughout the entire analysis process, the lead qualitative analyst kept a summary document as an audit trail to record the discussion elements and decisions made. The completed summary templates provided the essential information for further analysis.\n\nExplanatory condition identification\n\nNext the analysis team reviewed all the data sources and identified the factors most likely to be related to the presence of the outcome of interest, providing MAT. Potential explanatory conditions were identified based on clinical expertise, literature review, and feedback from the larger IT MATTTRs team. Once the potential explanatory conditions were identified, the analysis team organized the data into an Excel matrix, with the rows of the matrix enumerating the practices and the columns enumerating the explanatory conditions Supplementary material S1. The explanatory conditions included those emergent from the qualitative analysis (such as leadership buy-in), important practice descriptive health system information (such as practice size), and other factors (such as having a behavioral health provider). The qualitative team then reviewed the matrix in multiple passes to highlight and group categories consisting of similar dimensions; these were then reviewed and approved by the larger study team. Corroborating/legitimating occurred through review of existing literature and seeking out of associated experiences to confirm or refute insights from the analysis. After initial analysis identified data to support one theme or interpretation, particular effort was devoted to finding negative or disconfirming evidence, essentially examining the data and looking for alternative explanations or findings.\n\nQualitative comparative analysis\n\nGiven the nature of the data appearing to potentially be configurational, the research team decided to use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) (30\u201332), an analytical method used to study complex causality and the effects of context. QCA is uniquely useful in determining what combination of factors may contribute to a particular outcome. It may be used to analyze a mix of quantitatively-and qualitatively-derived data and, in contrast to traditional statistical analysis, is not dependent upon random or representative sampling. Based on Boolean algebra, which deals with logical operations (33), QCA is not constrained by degrees-of-freedom restrictions in the way that conventional statistics are and may therefore be applied to samples of arbitrary size (32, 34). To complete the QCA, we used the protocol outlined by Rihoux and Ragin (30). We first reviewed the emergent themes identified in the analysis above, arriving on an initial set of likely explanatory variables (\u201cconditions\u201d in the terminology of QCA). We then rescaled (\u201ccalibrated\u201d) these conditions onto a 0.0 to 1.0 scale for each practice. Table 2 presents the conditions and the guide the team used in coding them. The outcome condition was having a formal MAT system, defined as a system for identification of patients suffering OUD along with referral or treatment, behavioral health support/referral, peer support or referral, and follow-up plans. The scores represent the degree to which the practice exhibits the specified condition. The members of the analysis team then independently scored each practice using the coding guide, before coming together to compare and resolve any discrepancies. The final scoring involved going back to the transcripts, recalibrating if necessary, and determining each practice\u2019s final scores. This process was repeated for the outcome of providing MAT. The analyses were conducted using Kirq, a publicly available software package for QCA developed by co-author CR.\n\nTable 2\n\nTable 2. Outcome and explanatory conditions.\n\nThe QCA revealed that a number of conditions hypothesized to increase the provision of MAT were not causally explanatory. Such conditions were both contextual (e.g., is the practice part of a health system network; is the practice designated as a federally qualified health center) and proximate (e.g., does the practice serve a large number of patients with OUD; is MAT already provided in the community). Table 2 lists the conditions that were included in the final analysis; Supplementary Table 1 lists those conditions that were examined but found to be causally unimportant. One condition found to be of particular importance was practice size; the QCA revealed different causal \u201crecipes,\u201d or critical combinations of factors, for providing MAT depending upon whether the practice was small (1\u20132 medical providers), medium (3\u20135 medical providers), or large (6+ medical providers). The decision was therefore made to split the data set into three and conduct separate QCAs for the different practice sizes.\n\nAs described by Ragin (32, 34), QCA seeks to identify necessary and sufficient conditions that are related to the presence of an outcome. A unique benefit of QCA is that it is sensitive to issues of causal complexity (that multiple conditions may operate in tandem) and equifinality (that there may be multiple pathways or \u201crecipes\u201d to realizing an outcome). A necessary condition is a condition (or combination of conditions) that must be present for the outcome to occur; its absence prevents the outcome from occurring. A sufficient condition is a condition (or combination of conditions) that, when present, ensures that the outcome will occur. Necessity and sufficiency can be imperfect: it is perfectly appropriate to identify a particular combination of conditions as \u201calmost always\u201d necessary or sufficient.\n\nThe degree to which a given condition or combination of conditions is necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome is measured by two goodness-of-fit metrics: consistency and coverage. Ranging between 0.0 and 1.0, consistency measures the strength of the necessary or sufficient condition. Established standards for QCA use thresholds of > = 0.9 to establish necessity and > =0.8 to establish sufficiency. Coverage also ranges between 0.0 and 1.0 and measures empirical prominence; recipes with higher coverage scores explain a greater fraction of the outcome than recipes with lower coverage scores. A low coverage score may or may not indicate that the necessary or sufficient condition is trivial. There are not standard coverage scores for establishing necessity or sufficiency: a condition that explains only a small fraction of cases may still be substantively important.\n\nTo conduct a sufficiency analysis using QCA, the raw data matrix is first reformulated as a \u201ctruth table.\u201d Presented in Table 3, a truth table lists every possible combination of conditions, the number of practices belonging to each truth table row, and the associated consistency score, which expresses the degree to which the cases associated with a particular truth table row exhibit the outcome. Those rows lacking cases (referred to as \u201cremainders\u201d) are omitted to save space.\n\nTable 3\n\nTable 3. Truth tables describing large-, medium-, and small-sized practices providing MAT, sorted by consistency (consistency threshold: 0.80; proportion threshold: 1.0; frequency threshold: 1) remainders are excluded.\n\nAfter constructing the truth tables, software is used to perform a minimization process that identifies and eliminates logically-irrelevant conditions and mathematically reduces the truth table to a set of Boolean expressions.\n\nResults\n\nSome practices were unable to complete follow-up interviews due to practices closing, \u201cshared\u201d clinical staff across multiple participating practice sites, and a small number of practices that chose not to participate in follow-up interviews. We did not include data from practices that did not participate in follow-up interviews, which resulted in 35 practices out of 42 total with complete information. Descriptive information about the participating practices and practice members are shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4\n\nTable 4. IT MATTTRs practice interview participant descriptions.\n\nNecessity results\n\nThe necessity analysis revealed two conditions common to all practices that were providing MAT within 6 months of the conclusion of the study (Table 5). All such practices had a MAT prescriber on staff and MAT system in place, and both conditions exhibited perfect consistency with a consistency score of 1.0. The latter condition is, by definition, trivially necessary for delivering MAT, which is reflected in the relatively low coverage score of 0.39. The relatively higher coverage score of 0.53 for the former condition indicates that while all practices prescribing MAT also have an MAT prescriber on staff, there are also many practices with an MAT prescriber on staff that are not providing MAT.\n\nTable 5\n\nTable 5. Necessary conditions for providing MAT (consistency threshold: 1.0).\n\nSufficiency results\n\nThe sufficiency analysis revealed that practice size was a crucial explanatory condition, with seven different recipes associated with three different practice sizes\u2014two recipes describing small practices, three describing medium practices and two describing large practices. These results are reported in Figure 1 (35), which presents a Fiss configuration chart of seven recipes. In a Fiss chart, the recipes are read vertically, with circles indicating sufficient conditions and diamonds indicating necessary conditions. A filled glyph indicates the presence of a condition and a crossed glyph, its absence. When no glyph is printed, it indicates that the QCA minimization process has identified that condition as irrelevant within the context of the recipe: some practices exhibited the condition while others did not, yet all exhibited the outcome. Overall solution consistency is 0.94, indicating that a practice described by one (or more) of these recipes almost always was providing MAT at 6 months. Overall solution coverage is 0.86, indicating that most (but not all) practices that were providing MAT at 6 months are described by one or more of these recipes.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. Fiss chart describing characteristics of (S)mall, (M)edium, and (L)arge practices providing MAT.\n\nAcross the three practice sizes, all seven recipes share four conditions, indicating that these conditions that their relevance is independent of practice size. In addition to the two necessary conditions identified by the necessity analysis, each recipe also includes the presence of leadership buy-in and a key person driving the MAT program. Note that the fact that these two conditions are common to all seven recipes does not imply that they are necessary for providing MAT. Recall that solution coverage is less than 1.0, which indicates that there are practices providing MAT that are not explained by these recipes; that is, while these two conditions are certainly important to understanding the provision of MAT, the results of the QCA indicate that other pathways to providing MAT are also possible that lack one or both of these conditions.\n\nAmong small practices, an important condition was whether the practice was or was not private. Small private practices providing MAT lacked both a behavioral health practitioner as well as a clinician with previous experience providing MAT. In contrast, small non-private practices had staff members fulfilling both roles. Whether the practices were private or not does not appear to be particularly crucial for medium sized practices; some were and some were not. However, all the recipes describing medium-sized practices included the presence of a behavioral health provider; two also included a clinician with previous MAT experience. Two recipes describe large practices, none of which were private. One recipe describes practices that lacked a behavioral health practitioner and may or may not have a clinician with previous MAT experience. The other recipe describes practices that possess a clinician with previous MAT experience and may or may not have a behavioral health practitioner.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis analysis identified practice characteristics that are present in study practices that participated in a team-based training and were providing MAT. While there were numerous contemporary statewide initiatives to increase OUD treatment with buprenorphine, the communities participating in IT MATTTRs had a significantly greater increase in treatment than the rest of the state, as we previously reported (23). The results of the present study help inform practice-focused strategies to engage primary care in treating OUD with buprenorphine.\n\nSurprisingly, having a MAT prescriber in place was not present across all configurations, and not all practices with a waivered prescriber were engaged in the delivery of MAT. The results of this evaluation indicate that having a waivered buprenorphine prescriber is necessary but not sufficient to provide MAT in primary care practices. Having a key person or champion as well as leadership buy-in surfaced as important elements to MAT provision.\n\nDifferences in configurations tended to split out based on practice size, which may represent a proxy for resources. Interestingly, among small, private practices, neither behavioral health nor a clinician with prior MAT experience were relevant. This may reflect the flexibility of small private practices with clinicians who seek innovations and resources that keep their practice up-to-date and do not need to seek administrative approval to implement innovations. For medium and larger sized practices, the differences in configurations are less striking, with only one of the five configurations demonstrating no behavioral health presence.\n\nThe QCA identified many conditions as irrelevant that were initially expected to matter. Contextual factors like strong perceived community need and lack of a local MAT provider did not appear to be important factors in explaining MAT provision. Nor were health system or hospital affiliation. Similarly, practice change capacity and receiving either the SOuND or ECHO-delivered team training were also not conditions that entered into any configuration. The IT MATTTRs Team Training aims to engage full practice teams, strengthen leadership understanding of the importance and feasibility of MAT in primary care, and identify and activate practice champions, based on findings from numerous studies examining primary care practice improvement. One possibility is that Team Training serves to support these conditions versus standing as its own condition. Further, the comprehensive training may have made other conditions less relevant or necessary for increasing MAT by providing substantial background on the need for MAT in primary care as well as the support required to implement, when the key necessary and sufficient conditions were present.\n\nWhile recent trends in prescribing behavior indicate increasing prescriptions written by primary care clinicians compared to prescribers in other specialties (36\u201338), continued efforts to provide MAT in primary care are crucial to expanding access to treatment for OUD. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 expanded prescribing authority by eliminating the federal requirements of a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine (14), discipline restrictions, and patient limits. Additional types of professionals such as different levels of substance abuse counselors or psychologists may enhance service provision, however, hiring such professionals in rural areas can be challenging. Additional opportunities for increasing MAT implementation efforts may come from understanding the characteristics of current buprenorphine prescribers. The original Agency for Healthcare and Quality grantees reported several facilitators and barriers to MAT implementation in primary care (19). They report that practice culture related to opioid use stigma and community knowledge of treatment options are important factors in uptake of MAT in primary care. Secular changes in opioid use and abuse culture, with decreased opioid prescribing and increased availability of fentanyl analogs has impacted the opportunity to identify potential patients in primary care practices (39\u201341).\n\nLimitations\n\nQualitative work inherently is not meant to be inferential; it is intended to provide insight into what the selected group of participants might be experiencing or perceiving. Thus, this population of practices from selected rural Colorado may not be applicable to other rural populations. Even though we had high participation, it is possible that some selection bias may have occurred such that the sample was predisposed toward implementation of MAT. Multiple methods were used to validate the results including triangulation across researchers and multiple analysis methods; however, the results may have bias or misinterpretation of the stories shared in the interviews or through other methods. This study occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, and COVID has had a substantial impact on OUD, overdose deaths, and how OUD treatment is provided. This study does not address that concern.\n\nConclusion\n\nIT MATTTRS was a multi-component intervention for rural Colorado that included practice team training, prescriber waiver training, and community education. Overall, IT MATTTRs resulted in an increase in the number of primary care practices providing MAT through buprenorphine. The QCA results found that, as expected, having a waivered prescriber was necessary prior to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that, while important, prior MAT experience and behavioral health support were not required elements in all cases. In our data, successful implementation of buprenorphine treatment for OUD also entailed the presence of a practice champion and support from practice leadership. However, the QCA did not identify these as necessary conditions, indicating that they may not in fact always be required. Future research should investigate whether buprenorphine treatment for OUD can be successful in their absence and, if so, under which contexts. The results further revealed important differences by practice size, which may help inform practice-focused strategies to engage primary care in treating OUD with buprenorphine.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThe studies involving humans were approved by Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board.

It\u2019s really a day for his family, his friends, and the community.\u201d\n\nThe event was organized by the Forever 41 Committee, including Dakota Dreyer, Devin Tessier, Ryan Thompson, and Arie\u2019s family. Arie and Melissa's children played a central role in making the day possible, with overwhelming support from sponsors across the southeast.\n\nWalsh noted the strength of the turnout. \u201cRight now, we have over 160 golfers and a packed house for supper with a silent auction as well. The support has been overwhelming, and we are truly grateful. Arie was actually one of our own team members, so this means a lot to us.\u201d\n\nThe Forever 41 Foundation was created by Arie\u2019s sons, Austin and Attison Schimmel, following his passing in January. In a statement, they shared their mission:\n\n\u201cWe know that nothing can bring back our Dad, but to honour him, we wanted to make it our mission to speak up for Men\u2019s Mental Health and Suicide Awareness. We want to do the best we can to make sure no other family has to go through what we have gone through.\u201d\n\nThe tournament featured strong sponsorship support, including multiple beer hole sponsors, a putting green sponsor, and dozens of donations toward the silent auction. Funds raised will go toward mental health awareness initiatives and local supports.\n\nFor Walsh and the staff at Mainprize, the day was deeply meaningful. \u201cIt\u2019s really brought home the importance of mental health and suicide awareness. It\u2019s been a tough start to our year, but we\u2019ve all come back a little bit stronger and more compassionate. At the end of the day, this is honouring Arie, and I\u2019m super proud of this community for coming together.\u201d\n\nThe Forever 41 Golf Tournament is set to become an annual event, continuing Arie\u2019s legacy while opening up vital conversations about mental health and suicide prevention in the southeast.", "source_domain": "discoverweyburn.com", "article_id": "f3d1b446-f631-4138-8a87-c48bc823ca69", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

The new \"three-strike\" law in Aurora mandates the towing and impoundment of vehicles when they violate three specific conditions: expired registration, an unlicensed driver, and no proof of insurance.\n\nFernandez impounded the vehicle.

Covey uses a communication device to give commands to his service dog, Tessa.\n\nCBS\n\nWhen we visited, Covey commanded Tessa to \"Tug!\" Tessa grabbed a rope with her teeth that opened a sliding door. The dog's support enables Covey to go back and forth between his small house and the main house at the ranch south of Chatfield State Park where Covey now lives on his own.\n\n\"Good girl!\" Covey typed on his talker, celebrating Tessa's service.\n\nTessa is helping Covey to live a more independent life.\n\nAnd new, wider ramps recently installed by the Home Builders Foundation make it possible for Covey and his service dog to move about the property in synch.\n\nCarson appreciates how small accommodations like a wider doorway and ramp can make a big difference.\n\nCarson Covey's friends, Marc and Eric.

So having the dog and just having independence here coming and going has been life-changing for him. He doesn't want to rely on people for the things he things he's able to achieve on his own and he's very motivated to make it work no matter how hard it is and this has made it much more simple in the sense that he can come and go on his own without my assistance.\"\n\n\"It's freedom,\" Covey said about how much he relishes his independence.\n\nHe operates the automatic doors and window blinds and opens the refrigerator in his house so Tessa can get him a snack.\n\n\"Get,\" he commands. Tessa is not Covey's first service dog. He's still breaking her in.\n\n\"She's the third one but she's getting there,\" he said.\n\nCBS\n\nWe caught up with him on his way to greet a horse therapy student via a barn, heading to the riding arena.\n\n\"Horses bring kids to life,\" Covey says.\n\nLast year, Covey was selected to participate in the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities program at the University of Colorado. He just completed the program and is currently a self-advocate coach.\n\nTo date, the Foundation has provided modifications for the homes of more than 2,000 people, impacting the lives of thousands more.\n\nThe Home Builders modify about a dozen homes every month to give people like Covey the ability to achieve greater mobility and safety.\n\nCarson Covey\n\n\"How much their life is just a little bit easier throughout the day with the addition of a ramp and in Carson's case, the addition of a ramp that is wide enough for his service dog,\" Lauren Knudsen, the foundation's development director, said.\n\nIt costs about $5,000 to install a single ADA-compliant ramp.\n\nSince 2011, the Home Builders Foundation in Colorado has installed ramps estimated at $950,000 at no cost to the people who use them.\n\nCovey is hoping his work can improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of Coloradans living with disabilities.\n\nHe's fueled by the memory of his good friends, Mark and Eric.\n\n\"I am working to keep my friends' dream alive.

The launch is in collaboration with The Jed Foundation (JED), a leading national nonprofit that protects emotional health and prevents suicide for teens and young adults, and The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, Texas\u2019s most trusted source for data-driven mental health policy.\n\nHeadstream convened a diverse working group of 12 educational leaders whose collaboration resulted in a Roadmap with 10 key recommendations that can be put into action via the Navigator, a free, web-based resource for K-12 administrators and educators to inform and guide the process of choosing and using digital tools to support the mental health and well-being of students. The Navigator helps guide schools and districts serving adolescents from historically marginalized communities through the digital health product procurement journey with key features, including:\n\nIdentifying Core Challenges: Outlining evidence-based recommended practices for addressing common student mental health challenges.\n\nDiscovering School Success Stories: Understanding examples of successful implementations of digital well-being products in diverse school districts and learning from case studies.\n\nFunding Guidance: Exploring expert recommendations of processes for stakeholder engagement around assessing and selecting digital mental health products and strategies for resourcing initiatives.\n\nProduct Selection: Identifying key considerations to ensure the right product fit, including examples of 20 products that could be used to support youth mental health in schools.\n\nThese solutions come as nearly 70% of public schools have reported that the number of students seeking mental health services has increased since 2020.\n\n\u201cIn-person human care and interaction is critical to support student well-being,\u201d said David Ball, Senior Director at Headstream. \u201cHowever, the resources and capacity don\u2019t currently exist to meet the needs schools face. Technology-based interventions can support counselors, teachers, and schools to address student mental health at scale. The Navigator will walk education decision-makers through product procurement strategies that solve pressing issues like counselor shortages, and early intervention.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a former district leader myself, I have seen the need for innovative and flexible solutions when dealing with the complexity of student mental health. With the Navigator, administrators and district leaders will have a resource to help them make informed decisions on integrating digital interventions into their existing supports and systems for protecting the emotional well-being and mental health of students and school communities nationwide,\u201d said Tony Walker, PhD, Senior Vice President of Academic Programs at JED.\n\n\u201cWe all know that schools are searching for solutions to meet the growing mental health needs of students and staff in this country. The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute is excited to partner with Headstream and The Jed Foundation to develop this critically important resource for school districts who are struggling to connect students and staff to mental health services,\u201d stated Michelle Harper, Executive Vice President of State Partnerships and Executive Director of the Center for Child & Family Wellness at the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.\n\nThe K-12 Mental Health Tech Navigator is being provided for educational and informational purposes only. It provides illustrative examples of technology products that are marketed by third-party vendors for purchase and implementation by schools to augment support for mental health and well-being for its students. The K-12 Mental Health Tech Navigator is not an exhaustive list of all such products.

She was unable to open her hand enough for someone to hold it, and was afraid no one would want to try.\n\n\u201cThe words \u2018graceful\u2019 and \u2018cerebral palsy\u2019 are two words that are not typically used in the same sentence,\u201d explained Sarah, an individual with spastic cerebral palsy.\n\nWatch Sarah dance today and you would describe her as graceful. Not only has Sarah become a competitive ballroom dancer, she is helping CU Anschutz researchers explore how cerebral palsy impacts health and mobility in adults.\n\nFollowing a dream\n\nSarah was first inspired to follow her dream after seeing a news report about a blind individual who was able to learn ballroom dancing. She knew the challenges were different from her own, but thought there might be a way for her to learn. She called the dance studio, Colorado Dancesport, and explained her situation. They told her to come in for a lesson\u2014the lesson that she ultimately cancelled.\n\nThings were different six months later when she rescheduled for the eve of her 29th birthday. Despite still being nervous, she was resolved to pursue her dream.\n\n\u201cI stood across from my instructor, held out my hand, and I said, \u2018Hello my name is Sarah, I\u2019m 29 years old, and I would like to learn how to waltz.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven though learning to dance proved more difficult than she first thought, Sarah eventually had the dance down. Five months later she and her instructor were performing a tango routine in front of a live audience. After that she entered her first ballroom dance competition.\n\n\u201cI dance because I love it,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cI hope when I dance people see that.\u201d\n\nPeople do see it. They see it when Sarah talks about dancing. They see it when she steps onto the dance floor. They see a lot that can be learned from Sarah\u2019s determination, perseverance and courage.\n\nLearning from Sarah\n\nJim Carollo, director of the Center for Gait and Movement Analysis (CGMA) at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, and associate professor in the Departments of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R), Orthopedics, and Bioengineering, also thinks much can be learned from Sarah\u2019s active lifestyle. That is why he invited her to participate in the Cerebral Palsy Adult Transition (CPAT) study.\n\nThe CPAT study is designed to understand how the walking abilities of individuals with cerebral palsy change during the transition from childhood to adulthood. Carollo, along with coinvestigators Patricia Heyn, Amy Bodkin and faculty members from the PM&R Department, are analyzing 70 former CGMA patients to see how their gait and other variables compare to data collected when they were children.\n\n\u201cSome people with cerebral palsy assume that they will have to stop walking at some point,\u201d Carollo said. \u201cThey often think it is a natural consequence of the disorder. However there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that. What is important, is to identify and remove biomechanical obstructions to independent ambulation, and thereby avoid falling into a sedentary lifestyle, because there is evidence that that can lead to secondary health conditions, especially in patients with a pediatric condition.\u201d\n\nCarollo theorizes that maintaining an active lifestyle can help to maintain gait and walking ability\u2014ultimately allowing individuals to stave off secondary conditions that accompany a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nThe hours Sarah spends practicing and performing her dance routines could also be helping her to maintain overall health. Sarah was eager to participate in the study since she knew there is little research on adults with cerebral palsy.\n\n\u201cI was excited to learn they were doing research to help people over 18 with cerebral palsy,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of resources for that, and the condition doesn\u2019t go away just because you\u2019ve turned 18.\u201d\n\nThis is a significant problem, according to Bodkin, who noted that the CPAT study is hoping to begin bridging the gap between patients lost during the transition from pediatric care to adult care.\n\n\u201cCP patients tend to get lost between 18-21 years old,\u201d Bodkin said. \u201cThis happens to many adults with pediatric conditions. It is a combination of a lack of specialists and lack of insurance, as well as limited access to the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nPassport to health\n\nSeeking to provide an additional resource for CPAT study participants, Carollo, Heyn and Bodkin have created an individualized \u201chealth passport\u201d for every participant. The health passport incorporates data collected from the gait analysis as well as lipid and insulin panels, quality of life assessments and other tests to give guidance on how they can live a healthy lifestyle. The passport is presented at a conference with the participant and their family.\n\n\u201cThe health passport has been a strong motivator for patients to participate,\u201d Carollo said. \u201cThe passport is valuable to them since it provides input on how they might maintain or improve movement going forward.\u201d\n\nCarollo and the CPAT research team plan to conclude the data collection phase of the study by the end of summer 2016. They hope that once analyzed, the data will shed light on adults with cerebral palsy and offer new ideas on how to improve overall health and avoid secondary conditions often reported in this vulnerable population.\n\n\u201cAs a person who values measurement, I value being able to test previous patients not as an evaluation of the past, but as a roadmap for the future,\u201d Carollo said.", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu", "article_id": "cdc29d42-4a13-4f8c-a7d8-33c930738c62", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

On Sept. 3, 2020, HCSET reached another milestone by launching a pharmacy that will serve its patients. The new pharmacy is operating under the same roof as the Cleveland clinic, located at 307 N William Barnett Ave.\n\nThe pharmacy offers patients who meet certain income requirements and qualify for assistance to receive their prescriptions at vastly-reduced prices.\n\n\u201cSince the Health Center of Southeast Texas is a federally-qualified healthcare center, we are able to offer our patients these prices if they qualify and have given their financials to the clinic. The cost of the medicines is income-based,\u201d said Pharmacy Director Andee Kesner. \u201cThe whole point is to have all of these services under one roof. Not every med is available through our 340 B pricing, but there are a lot of different categories of medications, and a lot of drug classes have multiple meds within those classes.\u201d\n\nHealth Center of Southeast Texas Executive Director Steve Racciatto and Dr. Jasmine Sulaiman, HCSET medical director, (second from left) join the staff of the Cleveland clinic\u2019s new pharmacy for an official grand opening ceremony on Sept. 15. Pictured with them are Senior Technician Yesli Salas, Staff Pharmacist Lori Harrison and Pharmacy Director Andee Kesner.\n\nBecause the pharmacy is part of the HCSET\u2019s operation, the pharmacy has access to the patient\u2019s records and works with doctors to come up with the best solution to address the patient\u2019s medical needs.\n\n\u201cWe have the ability to go in the system and see what is the best option for the patient, and if we don\u2019t have the medicine that is prescribed, we work with the physicians to see if one of the other meds in the classes will work,\u201d Kesner said.\n\nThe pharmacy is \u201cclosed-door,\u201d meaning that it only serves HCSET patients.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of a 340 B pharmacy is to break down the barriers to care. Having the pharmacy here, we are able to maintain the patients\u2019 care better and that increases compliance with the patient. They are more likely to take their medications to maintain their health,\u201d Kesner said.\n\nSince the pharmacy opened, staff members have already seen the life-changing impact it is making on patients.\n\n\u201cWe have seen patients already who are in shock at the prices for their prescriptions. It\u2019s hard to explain to people why they can get them here so cheap. It\u2019s because we are a federally-qualified healthcare center,\u201d Kesner said. \u201cWe have patients paying $10 for a prescription that would have cost $400. We had a patient the other day who used to come in for blood work weekly so he could stay on a med that was cheap enough for him to afford. Now, we are able to offer him a different med that allows him to come in every three months. He also is not out the cost of the labs every week. That is something that would not have been available to him at another pharmacy.\u201d\n\nThe turnaround time for most prescriptions is minutes. By the time patients make the short walk from the clinic to the pharmacy, pharmacy staff members are already working to fill the prescription.\n\nThe Greater Cleveland Chamber of Commerce was part of the grand opening celebration for the Health Center of Southeast Texas\u2019s new pharmacy on Sept. 15. The clinic opened on Sept. 3.\n\n\u201cThe average wait time is 10 minutes,\u201d said Kesner, adding that medicines that are not readily available are ordered for next-day service.\n\n\u201cRight now we are finding ourselves ordering a lot of medications because we are still trying to figure out which ones we need to have on hand more often,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pharmacy is unable to fill compound prescriptions at this time, but Kesner hopes to expand in that area as the pharmacy grows. She says patients\u2019 reception of the pharmacy has been better than anticipated.\n\n\u201cWe expected it to be amazing but we didn\u2019t know if people would buy in, but they are,\u201d she said.\n\nCurrently, the pharmacy can only serve those without insurance who qualify for assistance through the clinic and self-pay patients, but Kesner says that within the next two months, most major insurance policies should be accepted.\n\nClinic hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on Wednesday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. It is closed on weekends.\n\nAccording to Kesner, HCSET is also looking at adding satellite pharmacies to offer prescriptions to patients at its clinics in Livingston, Liberty and Shepherd. In addition to Kesner, the Cleveland pharmacy is staffed by Yesli Salas, senior technician, and Lori Harrison, staff pharmacist. Bilingual assistance is available.\n\nFor more information on Health Center of Southeast Texas, go online to https://hcset.com/ or call 281-592-2224.", "source_domain": "bluebonnetnews.com", "article_id": "26366d1a-c51b-41ef-9d00-eb515484b5e5", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

{"url": "https://filtermag.org/why-are-methadone-patients-still-being-punished-for-marijuana-use/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Marijuana, which is now legal for medical use in 33 states and counting, can help treat pain\u2014something which opioids also treat. But people with opioid use disorders (OUDs), including those getting treatment with methadone or buprenorphine, may have a hard time getting the pain relief they need (and these days, even people without OUDs have a hard time getting pain relief).\n\nSo why do so many treatment programs\u2014including opioid treatment programs (OTPs, also known as methadone clinics) and office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) providers\u2014test for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis?\n\nContradictions in Colorado\n\nEven in Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize cannabis for recreational use, OTPs are required by state law to test for THC.\n\nTreatment providers there are frustrated by this. Tina Beckley, regional director in Colorado for Behavioral Health Group, said recently that ever since Colorado started requiring OTPs to test for THC in 2006, many patients have lost their take-home doses\u2014often, understandably, having thought that their medical marijuana card would spare them this sanction. Some decided to leave treatment as a result. It was a recipe for chaos and increased risk.\n\nIn Colorado, take-homes for people who receive medical marijuana are limited to those with no history of illicit marijuana use, who had a medical condition that was identified as being treatable with marijuana, and whose primary care providers agreed to the use of medical marijuana.\n\nThese problems began when only medical marijuana was permitted. With the advent of recreational marijuana in 2012, life for OTP patients\u2014and providers\u2014got even more complicated.\n\nMethadone patients use nicotine and alcohol without sanctions, yet the same still doesn\u2019t apply to state-legal marijuana. And this after many methadone patients, according to Beckley, moved to Colorado specifically for the marijuana.\n\nWhat Federal Rules Say\u2014And Don\u2019t\n\nHere\u2019s the catch-22. If an OTP does test for THC, and the sample comes up positive, the OTP can\u2019t necessarily just disregard it. Under some state and clinic rules, the OTP may take steps such as reducing the patient\u2019s take-home doses.\n\nBut there\u2019s no reason to do so, according to the federal guidelines.\n\nEven though THC testing is frequently applied in some states, this testing is never federally mandated except at admission.\n\nIf methadone doesn\u2019t show up in the toxicology reports, there is reason for concern\u2014the patient may be diverting take-homes and foregoing the benefits of methadone. If barbiturates or benzodiazepines show up, there is also reason for concern because of risks to the patient. (But taking barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or other opioids in addition to methadone might mean that the patient is not getting high enough dose of methadone; it does not mean that the patient should be punished.)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that cannabis combined with methadone is harmful. This is why, in the era of medical marijuana, there is little point in even testing for THC in OTPs, and in fact the federal government doesn\u2019t recommend it after the patient\u2019s first visit. Outmoded and outdated state regulations need to be fixed.\n\nEven though THC testing is frequently applied in some states, this testing is never federally mandated except at admission. Both the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Joint Commission, which together accredit and certify OTPs, say OTPs should only test patients for THC once\u2014upon admission. A \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter from SAMHSA, which is equivalent to regulation, does not suggest that OTPs test for THC.\n\nBut there is pushback\u2014don\u2019t assume that the federal government supports cannabis for people with OUDs. The SAMHSA letter expresses plenty of concern about potential harms related to marijuana use. And while some states have decreed that cannabis can be used instead of opioid agonists to treat opioid use disorders, this has prompted SAMHSA head Elinore McCance-Katz, MD, PhD, as well as OTPs, to disagree.\n\nAccording to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, however, in states where medical cannabis is legal, the same approaches should apply as are used for other medications. Indeed, other medications may cause some problems for patients taking methadone which cannabis does not cause.\n\nA Psychiatrist Who Prescribes Buprenorphine and Cannabis\n\nLeaving the situation of OTPs and methadone for a moment, let\u2019s consider buprenorphine. It\u2019s not only OTPs, which mainly dispense methadone, that are interested in helping patients by allowing cannabis.\n\nFrederick E. Kahn, MD, a psychiatrist practicing with Forest Recovery in New Jersey, prescribes cannabis for pain in his buprenorphine patients (though patients can\u2019t obtain a medical marijuana card from Forest; they need to have one already).\n\n\u201cIf the piece of the withdrawal you\u2019re experiencing is anxiety, maybe [cannabis] can help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne hundred percent of my patients became addicted to opioids because of having pain problems, mostly chronic,\u201d he told Filter. Complaints included lower-back pain, lupus, neck injuries and autoimmune diseases, he said. In addition, he said some of his patients became addicted following acute pain\u2014they were prescribed hundreds of pills of opioids after, for example, shoulder surgery.\n\nKahn said the cannabis doesn\u2019t help opioid withdrawal specifically\u2014there are other drugs for that\u2014but it can treat anxiety in some patients. \u201cIf the piece of the withdrawal you\u2019re experiencing is anxiety, maybe it can help you,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen beginning treatment for opioid use disorder with buprenorphine, his patients have adequate doses within the first 24 hours to treat their withdrawal, he said. Under-medication\u2014a dose that\u2019s not high enough\u2014is responsible for patients feeling withdrawal symptoms, and should not occur with good treatment. This is not always the case with OTPs, which are required by law to start methadone on low doses regardless of the dose the patient will end up on.\n\nKahn does test his patients, including for THC. But he doesn\u2019t use the results punitively. (And he\u2019s not an OTP, so doesn\u2019t have those federal regulations to deal with.)\n\n\u201cIf someone is positive and we didn\u2019t know about it, we talk about it with them, see what it\u2019s doing or not doing for them,\u201d said Kahn. \u201cWe work with them about it. Toxicology is not there to punish people. It\u2019s there to help guide treatment.\u201d\n\nHow does Kahn know that his patients are not, for example, using the cannabis addictively, but really need it for pain? \u201cThat comes from the doctor-patient relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell from the blood level.\u201d\n\nBut you can discuss it. \u201cAsk them how much they\u2019re smoking. We can talk about changing from smoking to either vaping or making some kind of foodstuff because of [lung] problems with smoking anything,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can talk about how many times they\u2019re using it a day, how many puffs, how many grams.\u201d The point is to make an active commitment to work together as doctor and patient, he said\u2014and to bear in mind that most of these cannabis-using patients are on fewer opioids for pain.\n\nAt Forest, patients come in voluntarily. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in therapy, so we\u2019re not just handing out buprenorphine\u2014we\u2019re following them closely,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople who work in New Jersey\u2019s cannabis dispensaries usually consult with the patients about strains and potency. But Kahn described this set-up as \u201cthe Wild West.\u201d They\u2019re not pharmacists or doctors, he said, \u201cthey just work there.\u201d\n\n\n\nContrasting Approaches in New York and Massachusetts\n\nNew York State does not require its OTPs to test for THC. Allegra Schorr, president of the Coalition of Medication-Assisted Treatment Providers and Advocates, the state\u2019s membership association of OTPs, told Filter that there is a very mixed message going out to OTPs about cannabis. Schorr, who is married to Kahn, also heads West Midtown Medical Group, a proprietary OTP based in New York City.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough evidence on chronic pain so that we should try this,\u201d said Schorr of medical cannabis for OTP patients. \u201cThere are some conditions that we can easily find consensus on.\u201d\n\nAnd she commended the state\u2019s regulatory agency, the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS), for not taking a hardline approach. Many other states have much to learn from this.\n\nMassachusetts, by way of contrast, is another state that, like Colorado, requires THC testing in its OTPs.\n\n\u201cConquering an opioid addiction is no easy feat for someone chemically handcuffed to narcotic medicines,\u201d said Benjamin Caplan, MD, founder of the CED Foundation and a physician who treats patients at the CED clinic. \u201cIn states with medicinal cannabis as an option, we see strong evidence of better results for recovery from opiates: fewer prescriptions, better pain management, less suffering, and better quality of life.\u201d\n\nPeter Grinspoon, MD, has treated OUD patients with cannabis as well. He has a primary care practice affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cIn the almost-universal anecdotal experience of the patients I\u2019ve treated, cannabis is the most effective medication for withdrawal symptoms from opioid addiction,\u201d he told Filter. \u201cCertainly better than clonidine and lofexidine. This is true whether they are or aren\u2019t in OTP programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my personal experience transitioning off of opiates,\u201d he added, \u201cI found cannabis to be profoundly helpful, particular in offsetting the physical symptoms of opiate withdrawal, as well as cravings and anxiety.\u201d\n\nSeeing Cannabis Use for What It Is\n\nAmong many studies on this issue, there have been these findings showing the benefits or lack of harms of cannabis for OTP patients:\n\nCannabis use does not negatively influence opioid outcomes among patients receiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment, with no difference in productivity and quality of life between individuals maintained on buprenorphine with and without current cannabis use.\n\nFor people who use drugs and start opioid agonist treatment, daily cannabis use was associated with a 21 percent greater odds of treatment retention compared with less-than-daily cannabis use.\n\nCannabis use dropped significantly following methadone dose stabilization, and data suggested that objective ratings of withdrawal symptoms decrease in methadone patients using cannabis during this stabilization period\n\nIt\u2019s not that most OTPs necessarily want their patients to take cannabis; many do not. But it should be up to the program\u2019s discretion, they say, not mandated by state or federal governments in terms of testing and sanctions such as loss of take-homes.\n\nAnd emerging evidence that cannabis helps with opioid craving make it even more important to use judgment, and not hard-and-fast rules, about cannabis\u2014especially during an opioid-involved overdose crisis.\n\nRetention in treatment is much more important than keeping people off of cannabis, which\u2014unlike, say, illicit fentanyl\u2014isn\u2019t responsible for any deaths.\n\nPhoto: Sonya Yruel / Drug Policy Alliance", "source_domain": "filtermag.org", "article_id": "aacfc545-d58b-4d1a-9f69-9210cd6461eb", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

It is our honor to support organizations like United Way and the American Red Cross to help our western North Carolina communities through Hurricane Helene and its aftermath.\u201d Sam Hazen, chief executive officer, HCA Healthcare\n\nHCA Healthcare\u2019s Nashville-based Enterprise Emergency Operations Center, a multi-disciplinary incident response team of nearly 200 leaders, is actively working to provide its western North Carolina hospitals with the resources they need to care for patients and support colleagues in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\nLeading up to the storm, HCA Healthcare activated its Nashville-based Enterprise Emergency Operations Center (EEOC), comprised of nearly 200 multi-disciplinary leaders, including risk management, clinical experts, supply chain, patient logistics, air and ground transport and community liaison representatives. The EEOC is working alongside hospital leadership to distribute key resources to care teams in the Southeastern U.S. before, during and after the catastrophic storm. HCA Healthcare colleagues from across the country, including more than 100 nurses, as well as physicians and HCA Healthcare\u2019s incident support team, are continuing to arrive to provide support to local caregivers.\n\nHCA Healthcare is also a longstanding national partner of the American Red Cross, through its Annual Disaster Partner Giving Program (ADGP), which includes an annual contribution of $500,000, that helps the organization have the infrastructure, resources and technology in place to provide care and comfort to those in need. Over the last eight years, HCA Healthcare has provided nearly $8 million in financial support to the Red Cross for disaster relief efforts, including Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Hurricanes Florence and Michael in 2018, and the Texas winter storms and Kentucky tornadoes in 2021. The company also supported relief efforts following Hurricane Ian and historic flooding in Kentucky in 2022 and tornado relief efforts in Middle Tennessee in 2023.\n\n\u201cThough the level of destruction is immense, I am proud of the dedication of our colleagues, who have continued to support our patients, our community and one another. We remain dedicated to helping our colleagues through this time, just as they have selflessly served their community and supported patients without hesitation.\u201d Greg Lowe, president and CEO, Mission Health\n\nOn September 29, 2024, more than 100 HCA Healthcare nurses traveled to Western North Carolina to provide support and relief for caregivers at Mission Hospital.\n\nHCA Healthcare established the HCA Healthcare Hope Fund to support colleagues in disasters such as this. The HCA Healthcare Hope Fund is an employee-run, employee-supported 501(c)(3) charity that provides financial aid and resources to employees after an extended illness, injury, disaster or other special situation. Since its inception, the HCA Healthcare Hope Fund has given more than $110 million in grants helping more than 56,000 colleagues and families.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "da2f54e2-27bc-44b6-ad3b-0a33e2e6ecdb", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

It also helps explain associations, such as why diabetes and obesity are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nRichard Johnson, MD\n\n\"In essence, we propose that Alzheimer's disease is a modern disease driven by changes in dietary lifestyle in which fructose can disrupt cerebral metabolism and neuronal function,\" said author Richard Johnson, MD, professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nJohnson outlines data that showcase the overactivation of cerebral fructose metabolism that can drive Alzheimer's disease. The source of fructose is largely from endogenous production in the brain. Thus, the reduction in mitochondrial energy production is hampered by neuronal glycolysis that is inadequate, resulting in progressive loss of cerebral energy levels required for neurons to remain functional and viable.\n\nResearchers hope study can help spur novel treatments\n\n\"By outlining consistent evidence, we're hoping to inspire researchers to continue exploring the relationship between fructose in the brain and Alzheimer's disease. New treatments aimed at inhibiting intracerebral fructose metabolism could provide a novel way to prevent and treat this disease,\" Johnson adds.\n\nIn one of the scenarios outlined by Johnson and his collaborators, glucose hypometabolism increased oxidative stress, and a progressive loss of mitochondria occured, leading eventually to neuronal dysfunction and death. In this scenario, the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are part of the inflammatory response and participate in injury, but are not the central factors driving the disease.\n\nJohnson mentions that theoretically, inhibiting enzymes in the brain that are involved in fructose production or metabolism might provide novel ways to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu", "article_id": "5099c394-ad84-4eab-974f-81b92cbcb0c0", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

You wake up with a sore throat, swollen glands, and a fever \u2013 textbook symptoms of strep throat. But, you have a meeting at 9 a.m. that you just can\u2019t miss and so, you have two hours to get ready, get to see a care provider, and get to the office. Where do you go? What do you do?\n\nMany patients, in similar situations, are turning to urgent care centers to get the convenient, quality care they need. And, CareNow, HCA Healthcare\u2019s national chain of urgent care centers, are available to provide our brand of exceptional care in convenient, easy-to-access locations across the nation.\n\nTim Miller, president of HCA Healthcare\u2019s Urgent Care Services, tells us more about the biggest misconception \u2013 and the benefits \u2013 of urgent care centers and what he learned from one of his greatest inspirations and mentor \u2013 the founder of CareNow.\n\nName: Tim Miller\n\nJob Title: President of HCA Healthcare\u2019s Urgent Care Services\n\nHometown: Lewisville, Texas\n\nYears at HCA Healthcare: 2.5\n\nLife before HCA Healthcare: I started my career in urgent care over two decades ago around the time CareNow was founded in 1993. I served in various roles over the years but most recently as president and CEO.\n\nHow would you describe your role: I serve our patients, our physicians, employees and market leaders and together accomplish our mission to deliver quality, convenient, patient centered urgent care that supports HCA Healthcare\u2019s mission to care for an improve human life.\n\nWhen did you get interested in healthcare? I grew up as a missionary kid on an island in the South West Pacific (Papua New Guinea). My mom was a nurse and I had the privilege of often helping her take care of patients who were very sick. The nearest doctor was 500 miles away and she often had to get on the radio and ask for direction on the care of a very sick adult or child with malaria, dysentery or traumatic injury. My first love of healthcare came from her as she dedicated her life to help these people.\n\nThree words to describe urgent care centers: Convenience, Quality and Care\n\nWhat services are offered across HCA Healthcare\u2019s urgent care centers? General illness diagnosis and treatment, quick flu tests, EKGs, x-rays, minor emergencies, scrapes/lacerations, sprains/strains, contusions, eye injuries, burns, sports physicals.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between urgent care and ER? Urgent care is great for non-life-threatening problems, such as minor injuries, common illness, rashes, sore throats or sprains and strains. Emergency rooms are for any life-threatening or disabling conditions, sudden or unexplained loss of consciousness, major injuries, chest pain, shortness of breath, high fever with stiff neck, mental confusion or difficulty breathing. Urgent care centers are typically staffed with family doctors and advanced practice providers (APPs) (i.e. nurse practicioners, physician assistants) while ERs are staffed with ER doctors, APPs and specialists.\n\nBiggest misconception about urgent care centers: I think that there is still a misconception as to quality of care. I still cringe when I hear people refer to urgent care centers as \u201cdoc in the box\u201d. While this could be true in some urgent care centers, I believe that CareNow, HCA Healthcare\u2019s urgent care centers, offer the highest quality urgent care available in the country. The first element of quality is our doctors, which is why we have a physician-driven model. We also believe that accreditation is fundamental to quality.\n\nWhat do you like best about your line of work? I love urgent care because it allows us to take care of patients during their time of need. I remember when the swine flu hit in September 2009 all of the doctors\u2019 offices in the area were completely booked and patients were in a panic thinking they had contracted a life threatening disease. We saw patients in most of our clinics that year until 1:00 a.m. in the morning. It was a crazy time, but so many patients thanked us for being there for them when they could not have otherwise been seen outside of long waits in the ER. The physicians and staff hold all of the credit as they work tirelessly in their care of the patients.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important thing you\u2019ve learned over the course of your career? To work hard, be accountable, conscientious and humble.\n\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? The founder of CareNow David Walter was a great mentor for most of my career. He taught me the importance of humility, the pursuit of excellence and generosity. I remember a couple times over the years we outgrew our existing office space. Every time we moved he gave me the larger office, nicer desk/furniture and chose the small office or in one case, when we were out of space, the storage closet for his office. We had a prayer room that we would meet every Tuesday and pray for the needs of the company. If someone was hurting or had a death in the family he was the first to be at the bedside. The other great inspiration to me was my father. He gave his life to help the poor and suffering. He taught me kindness, gentleness and to serve others.\n\nWhat\u2019s your go-to app on your phone? CareNow\u2019s mobile operating system app that allows me to see the wait times in all of our clinics across the country.\n\nBest way to decompress: Spend time with my wife. I am fortunate that my wife plans great trips for us and we love to travel and experience new places.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best part of your job? The people I work with and the patients we serve. I love coming to work every day and seeing the smiles and hearing the encouraging words.\n\nWhat\u2019s an item on your bucket list? Visiting New Zealand.\n\nWhat advice would you give your younger self? Slow down a little and enjoy life. Invest more time in family and friends. Learn to say \u201cno\u201d more. Work harder.\n\nWhen you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? Many kids growing up in the U.S. want to be police officers or firefighters. For me, the heroes were the pilots who flew in some of the most dangerous conditions on the planet, where people live isolated from the rest of the world, cut off from the most basic necessities. They would deliver medicine and doctors, disaster relief, education, food supplies. I remember holding my breath and watching pilots navigate a box canyon and land in a clearing on the side of a mountain.\n\nWhat\u2019s the future of urgent care centers at HCA Healthcare? We know that across all of the communities we serve, our patients want convenience and to experience healthcare, in non-emergent settings, in ways similar to how they access other services. To meet that need, we will continue to acquire and build new urgent care centers across the nation to provide our patients with a full panel of care options.\n\nVisit here for more information on CareNow\u00ae Urgent Care, a division of HCA Healthcare.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "8ec14152-5616-444e-be36-f8d44ddca57c", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Rudolph\n\nSupporting positive mental health in early childhood is critical to mental and physical health outcomes later in life. One of the best ways to prevent the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is by fostering responsive relationships between caregivers and children. Since early childhood mental health is inextricably linked to caregiver mental health, caregiver mental illness is considered an ACE.\n\nWhile stress and traumatic events in early childhood are associated with negative mental health status in adulthood, children whose mothers report positive mental health are less likely to develop mental health and behavioral disorders later in life, highlighting the importance of interventions and support for positive caregiver mental health. It\u2019s estimated that approximately 44% of adult depressive disorders could be prevented with the elimination of ACEs.\n\nState, territorial, and freely associated state health organizations have an important role in safeguarding positive mental health in young children and their caregivers. Support for programs and policies that encourage positive mental health in early childhood and provides support for parents and caregivers to have the best chance to improve mental health across the life course. Caregiver and family interventions are critical components of effective mental health therapies for young children.\n\nNational Efforts to Improve Early Childhood Mental Health Outcomes\n\nRecent research and headlines about the early childhood mental crisis have spurned national, state, and local action. The federal government issued a recent letter to states, tribes, and jurisdictions outlining a national plan to align state-level coordination across federal funding streams to advance and expand mental health services for children. The letter describes opportunities for states to address the rise in diagnoses of mental illness in children from 3-17 years old, including leveraging the HRSA Title V Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s (SAMHSA) Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, and the Administration for Children and Families\u2019 Title IV-E Prevention Program. It also suggests states coordinate and fully utilize mental and behavioral health services and programs covered by Medicaid.\n\nSAMHSA\u2019s Infant Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) grant program also supports mental health in early childhood. IECMH designs programs that serve children at risk of developing or those showing early signs of having a diagnosis of mental illness to improve mental health outcomes for children from birth through age 12. Strengthening caregiver mental health is an important goal of the IECMCH through multigenerational therapy and other services that aim to strengthen caregiving relationships. From 2019 \u2013 2021 alone, over 9,000 young children and caregivers received evidence-based mental health and related services through IECMH. For more information, health agencies can connect with the national center that provides technical assistance to increase mental health consultations throughout the country.\n\nState Examples\n\nIn 2019, in New York state, several state agencies collaborated to create new behavioral health services available for any child aged 0-21 eligible for Medicaid and meeting medical necessity guidelines. These Children and Family Treatment and Support Services were designed to deliver services in the community where it works best for families and children. This approach helps overcome barriers such as access to transportation and childcare for other children. Authorized under Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment benefit, these services include family and youth peer support, therapy, rehabilitation, and crisis intervention.\n\nTennessee\u2019s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services manages the new Behavioral Health Safety Net for Children, which provides mental health services to children aged 3-17 who are uninsured or underinsured for behavioral health conditions. As of 2021, services available include but are not limited to assessment and evaluation for a behavioral health concern, individual and family therapeutic intervention, care management, peer support services, transportation, and psychiatric medication management. Administered through community mental health agencies, participants have access to an outreach coordinator and referrals to other behavioral health payor sources.\n\nIn July 2022, Colorado established the Department of Early Childhood to unite Colorado\u2019s early childhood systems and support the health and well-being of all of Colorado\u2019s children, their families, and early childhood professionals. The department supports social-emotional development and mental health through early childhood mental health consultants for providers, parents, and caregivers. The Colorado Early Childhood Mental Health Specialists program focuses on early identification and treatment to help early care providers create environments that support mental health and well-being among children and families. The department also houses the Colorado Early Childhood Mental Health Support Line for parents and caregivers searching for information related to early childhood mental health. It offers videos, print materials, and additional resources to raise awareness and support families\u2019 learning and understanding of mental health.\n\nRecommendations for State and Territorial Health Agencies\n\nRecognizing that rates of early childhood mental health disorders have increased in recent years, assess the status of statewide early childhood mental health. Consider looking for county and township-level trends, if possible.\n\nExpand child mental health outpatient and crisis services in Medicaid. Gathering data on the effectiveness of these services can help make the case with private health plans to cover similar services and further bolster the mental health system.\n\nEngage youth and caregivers in formulating new policy and programming ideas. Ensure that families and caregivers are included in mental health service provision.\n\nEncourage collaboration among state agencies and public and private partners to participate in federal early childhood and caregiver mental health programs such as SAMHSA\u2019s Project LAUNCH, Indigenous Project LAUNCH, and IECMH.\n\nWork with state Medicaid agencies to promote innovative financing arrangements for early childhood mental health services.\n\nAs rates of early childhood and caregiver mental health concerns continue to increase and access to mental health providers is increasingly diminished, health agencies have a responsibility to use available mechanisms to support positive early childhood and caregiver mental health.", "source_domain": "www.astho.org", "article_id": "3554368a-e4ff-479b-a0d9-5e360ebc3253", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

He had been reported missing late one evening in June 2012. Police suspected he was planning to take a bus.\n\nMonths after the attempted escape, late in 2012, he was sentenced to a year in a military prison. After a bad conduct discharge in 2014, Kelley moved to Colorado, where he was cited on an animal cruelty charge for allegedly beating a dog.\n\nHe remarried and moved to New Braunfels, Texas, about 35 miles from the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, where police say he killed 26 people, including an unborn child, and injured 20, at the First Baptist church before he was shot twice by a civilian and fled in his SUV. The 26-year-old was found dead a couple of miles from the scene, seemingly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA couple who survived, Joaquin Ramirez and his partner, Roseanne Solis, told KSAT local news that after an initial hail of gunfire, Kelley went through the church shooting anyone who made a noise, including children.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are trying to determine a motive for the mass slaughter, and on Monday said that there was a \u201cdomestic situation\u201d that included threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who was known to attend the church but was not present on Sunday.\n\nInvestigators have so far been unable to access Kelley\u2019s phone because of its security protections and have sent it to FBI headquarters in Virginia, Chris Combs, an FBI special agent, said at a Tuesday news conference.\n\nThe US air force said in a statement on Monday that the base failed to enter the record of Kelley\u2019s domestic violence conviction into the national background check system for firearms sales. Had they done so it would have raised red flags when he attempted to buy guns. A Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives official said on Monday that Kelley purchased four guns between 2014 and 2017; he had a rifle and two handguns with him on Sunday.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "article_id": "135f3d2f-6d07-4ece-bbbb-71e156d6986a", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

There is one place in your home that may not be on your list to de-clutter and dust, but it should be \u2013 the medicine cabinet. Spring is a great time to re-evaluate the safety of your family\u2019s medicine cabinet and clean out your household supply of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications.\n\nConsider this \u2013 nearly 80 percent of Americans using heroin right now say they got hooked on prescription opioids first. Could spring cleaning your medicine cabinet be the end of this deadly trend?\n\nWe sat down with Karla Miller, vice president of pharmacy services and clinical therapeutics at HCA Healthcare, for insight on proper medicine storage and disposal to prevent accidental poisonings and overdoses.\n\nWhy is cleaning out your medicine cabinet important?\n\nKeeping unused medications in your medicine cabinet undoubtedly increases the risk for theft of medication and resultant consequences that are likely to occur from this activity, such as calls to poison control centers, hospitalization and even death.\n\nAccording to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, six million Americans misused controlled prescription drugs. This study shows that a majority of abused prescription drugs were obtained from family and friends, often from the home medicine cabinet.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recently provided more data to strengthen the link between failing to discard unused medications and deviant activity. They conducted a national survey that found 53 percent of people 12 years or older who misused prescription pain relievers in the past year obtained the pain relievers most often from a friend or relative. It is important to routinely clean out your cabinet to avoid misuse and medication diversion, sharing and trading medicines, theft of medication, doctor shopping or buying medications from patients.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest concern of having old or unused medications?\n\nThe biggest concern of having old or unused medications around the house regards the risk to our pediatric population. The statistics may shock you:\n\nWhat is HCA Healthcare doing in the pharmacy space to ensure medications like opioids, for example, don\u2019t get into the wrong hands?\n\nHCA Healthcare has developed a multidisciplinary Pain Steering Committee dedicated to appropriate use of opioids and multimodal treatment of pain. We are taking multiple measures to minimize the abuse of opioids among our patients by reducing the volume of these medications prescribed. This begins by having a conversation with patients about their expectations for pain management, explaining they may experience some pain after surgery.\n\nHCA Healthcare also recently implemented the Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, which is devoted to maximizing function after surgery instead of heavily focusing on pain management. Our caregivers have often elected to provide non-opioid medications for patients seeking pain relief.\n\nFurthermore, physicians now have access to aggregated electronic health record providing data that will allow them to prescribe medications like opioids judiciously. By the end of 2019 we will have over 2000 physicians electronically prescribing controlled substances. Electronic prescribing of controlled substances decreased the risk of these medications getting in the wrong hands.\n\nIn 2013, HCA Healthcare\u2019s Physician Services Group developed controlled substance monitoring guidelines for its physicians and advanced practice providers. Recommendations include screening state prescription drug monitoring programs, implementing controlled substance agreements with patients and using random drug screens when deemed necessary.\n\nWe\u2019ve also partnered with leaders in our company\u2019s sustainability program to create a continuing education course for our pharmacists and nurses and educational and guidance materials that are shared with the healthcare industry.\n\nWhat are 3-5 tips people can use to safely dispose of their medication at home?\n\nThe safest and most responsible option is to take unwanted medications to a drug take-back site.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) hosts National Prescription Drug-Take Back Events periodically devoted to providing an opportunity for people to discard their unused medications. Local law enforcement agencies may also conduct drug take-back programs.\n\nThe next DEA Take-Back Day observance occurs today, April 27, 2019.\n\nClick here to find a Drug Take-Back Collection Site near you.\n\nHCA Healthcare will be hosting a Take-Back Day in the fall of 2019.\n\nIf you can\u2019t find a convenient disposal site or take-back event in your area, here are some suggestions for safe medication disposal:\n\nCheck the dates on your medications, including ointments, supplements and vitamins. Discard any of these products that are beyond their expiration date due to the loss of effectiveness and potential for them to become toxic. Discard items that have changed color, smell or taste, including those medications whose colors have faded. This indicates that the medication has been exposed to too much sunlight. For prescription medications, follow the \u201cone-year cut off\u201d rule. Discard any prescriptions that are more than one year old. Discard medications that are in unmarked containers, especially if they cannot be identified. In the future, ensure that medications that are still within their expiration date and being used by the patient are kept in their original containers so that they may be easily identified. At HCA Healthcare, due to potential harm to the environment, we take steps to not throw medications out or flush them down the toilet. Similarly, flushing medications down the toilet at home is not recommended. Instead, a method that is available to almost everyone at home is to simply place all medications in a sealable bag. For solid medications, add some water to dissolve them. Then, add items such as coffee grounds, kitty litter, sawdust or any material that mixes well and makes the medication unappealing for children or animals to eat. Seal the bag, and place it in the garbage. After properly disposing of the medication, remove any identifying information on the prescription bottle, clean it, and recycle.\n\nFor more information, check out the FDA\u2019s website on disposing of unused medication, which offers further details on how to safely dispose of certain medications.\n\nHappy spring cleaning!", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "c26ce433-5339-46d2-beb9-5c2dc7a55023", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

After six seasons with the Canadiens, Drouin signed a one-year deal with the Avalanche this offseason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAhead of the upcoming season, Drouin spoke to ESPN\u2019s Ryan S.

I'd walk my dog six times a day to get out of my house.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDrouin told Clark that he didn\u2019t sleep, criticizing himself for poor performances and plays he could\u2019ve made during previous games. During the 2020-21 season, Drouin realized he needed to take a step back from hockey in order to address his mental health.\n\n\"My body literally shut off on me. I remember that first practice and came to the hotel room and started feeling sick, started feeling tired and started having attacks,\" Drouin said. \"It was new for me and I thought I was sick. I thought I had a fever or something. Obviously, the doctor came and saw me and there was no fever and now I was even more worried about why I was feeling this way.\"\n\nDrouin has often been weighed down by lofty expectations placed upon him as a prolific scorer with the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, where he and MacKinnon won the Memorial Cup together in 2013. Selected third overall in the 2013 draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning, Drouin struggled to produce consistently and was traded to Montreal in June 2017 in exchange for Mikhail Sergachev.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe trade has been a source of consternation, as Sergachev won two Stanley Cups and has blossomed into a genuine top-tier defenseman who will be a perennial down-ballot Norris Trophy candidate.\n\nHaving grown up watching Canadiens games, Drouin thought he would be prepared for the unique pressure of being a French Canadian player in that market. He was mistaken.\n\n\"Until you live it, no one's ready for it,\" Drouin said.\n\nDrouin\u2019s agent, Allan Walsh, also attested to the unique pressures of playing in hockey-mad Montreal.\n\n\"You want to be welcoming and understand that this is a privileged set of circumstances that you are living under, yet at the same time when things are not going well, it's just grinding you down every day,\" said Walsh, who grew up in Quebec himself. \"There's no getting away from hockey off the ice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"What players tend to do in this situation ... is you tend to cocoon.

This expanded work with Google Cloud is part of a strategic partnership announced in 2021 that includes safeguards to protect patient privacy and the security of data.\n\nAs part of a pilot program that began early this year, approximately 75 emergency room physicians at four HCA Healthcare hospitals started using Google\u2019s AI technology to quickly and more easily document key medical information from conversations during patient visits. It is part of a collaboration among HCA Healthcare, Google Cloud, and Augmedix, a healthcare technology company that specializes in ambient medical documentation.\n\nPhysicians use an Augmedix app on a hands-free device to create accurate and timely medical notes from clinician-patient conversations. Augmedix\u2019s proprietary platform then leverages natural language processing, along with Google Cloud\u2019s generative AI technology and multi-party medical speech-to-text processing, to instantly convert the data into medical notes, which physicians review and finalize before they are transferred in real time to the hospital\u2019s electronic health record (EHR).

Crushing the Crisis during fifth annual prescription drug take back day\n\n(October 2023) HCA Healthcare hosted our fifth annual \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d prescription drug take back day on October 28, 2023. Our organization has now collected more than 67,500 pounds of medication since launching \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d as an enterprise initiative in 2019.\n\nThis year, all 15 HCA Healthcare U.S. divisions participated alongside local law enforcement in a \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d prescription drug take back day to raise awareness about the dangers of prescription drug misuse and the importance of proper disposal of unused or expired medications. An estimated 9 million doses of medication were collected at 132 collection sites across 15 states.\n\nHCA Healthcare facility events with the greatest amount of medication collected this year include:\n\nIn addition to \u201cCrush the Crisis\u201d events, efforts to reduce prescription drug misuse and transform pain management include:\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR): a multi-modal approach to pain management using pre-, intra- and post-operative interventions to optimize outcomes. HCA Healthcare\u2019s ESR programs have demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and patient satisfaction.\n\nElectronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS): aims to stem increasing rates of opioid-related addiction, misuse diversion and death by making it more difficult for medication-seekers to doctor-shop and alter prescriptions. Physicians have access to aggregated electronic health records, providing data that will allow them to prescribe opioids judiciously.\n\n4. Investing in clinical education and training for nurses\n\n(May 2023) Providing effective clinical education and career support for our nurses is the first step in delivering high-quality patient care. This year, we announced a more than $300 million in investment to support the education and training of nurses. This includes $200 million towards the expansion of Galen College of Nursing and approximately $136 million towards the opening of new HCA Healthcare Centers for Clinical Advancement. HCA Healthcare has plans to open twenty additional centers in the next three years.\n\nHCA Healthcare\u2019s purchase of Galen College of Nursing in 2020 brought together two of the leading nursing organizations to increase access to nursing education and to provide career opportunities for both students and colleagues. Since joining HCA Healthcare, Galen College of Nursing has announced more than a dozen new campuses and increased enrollment to over 12,000 students.\n\nThe Centers for Clinical Advancement operate independently from nursing schools and are dedicated to helping nurses advance their skills and careers. New nursing graduates use the centers to complete their Nurse Residency program and choose specializations, while veteran nurses can use the centers to earn advanced certifications. From classroom instruction to high-fidelity immersive simulations, the centers are equipped with technology that allows students to learn from clinical experts.\n\n5. Increasing mental wellness education for young girls\n\n(September 2023) As a result of a $1.38 million grant from the HCA Healthcare Foundation to Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) in 2022, HCA Healthcare and GSUSA announced the launch of a series of patch programs designed to increase mental wellness in girls in 4th through 12th grade.\n\nThe GSUSA Mental Wellness Patch Programs, developed in partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the GSUSA Program Advisory Committee, including HCA Healthcare behavioral health experts, are currently available to all councils nationwide. The programs, Knowing My Emotions, Finding My Voice and Showing Up for Me and You, encourage girls to:\n\nLearn about mental wellness for themselves and others;\n\nRecognize and understand their feelings;\n\nEffectively cope with mental health challenges; and\n\nFeel comfortable seeking help.\n\nThe 90-minute programs include activities, such as making art or writing poetry, that foster resilience and help girls to better understand their world. Program materials also contain meeting aids, parent/caregiver resources, teaser activities and marketing tools to equip Girl Scout troop leaders and council staff with support and activities focused on mental wellness, behavioral issues and healthy habits. Each patch program also includes an adult facilitator guide to help adults approach girls in a sensitive way, prompt important conversations and guide them through difficult moments.\n\n6. Moving medicine forward through clinical trials and research\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic inspired renewed public interest in clinical research. But using it to help doctors and researchers learn more about diseases and improve healthcare is anything but novel.\n\nAcross HCA Healthcare, clinical research has brought forth new medications, new ways of doing surgery, new medical devices, new ways to use existing treatments and new ways to improve the quality of life for our patients with acute or chronic illnesses.\n\nWe\u2019re including few of the top HCA Healthcare clinical research stories that made headlines in 2023:\n\n(October 2023) We announced a large multi-state study by HCA Healthcare, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and the University of California, Irvine which found that a nasal antibiotic ointment, mupirocin, which is currently used daily for intensive care unit (ICU) patients in only one-third of U.S. hospitals, is highly effective at preventing Staphylococcus aureus infections in critically ill patients, outperforming an antiseptic solution.\n\nThis study was published in JAMA and involved more than 800,000 ICU patients in 137 HCA Healthcare hospitals and built upon an earlier study among these research partners demonstrating that daily bathing with antiseptic chlorhexidine soap plus nasal mupirocin for all ICU patients prevented many bloodstream and other serious infections. This strategy is called \u201cdecolonization\u201d because it reduces the amount of bacteria on the body in order to reduce infection risk. Today, as a result of the previous study, the majority of ICUs bathe patients with chlorhexidine; however, only one-third of hospital ICUs provide nasal mupirocin to all patients, largely due to fears of fueling antibiotic resistance.\n\n(October 2023) We also announced in October that HCA Healthcare\u2019s Johnston-Willis Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, is the first hospital in the United States to provide treatment in a new clinical trial for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. This clinical trial, conducted by HCA Healthcare Research Institute and sponsored by Insightec, a global healthcare company pioneering the use of focused ultrasound technology, investigates the benefit of combining noninvasive focused ultrasound with systemic immunotherapy as an alternative.\n\nJohnston-Willis Hospital is hosting the trial and has already enrolled the first two U.S. patients who are currently undergoing a total of six treatment cycles each. The patients have metastatic brain cancer, which originated from cancer cells spreading to the brain from the primary tumor in their lungs. The new treatment uses Insightec\u2019s system to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which defends the brain against harmful substances, but also prevents critical medications from being delivered. By opening the BBB, non-small cell lung cancer medications may reach and target the critical lesions in the brain.\n\n7. Addressing food insecurity\n\n(December 2023) In December, HCA Healthcare announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund gave $375,000 in grants to nonprofits as part of its new Health Equity Catalyst Grant Program. This year, the grants were given to nonprofits addressing food insecurity and providing access to healthy foods across the country.\n\nLaunched for the first time in 2023, the Health Equity Catalyst Grant program provides one-time operating grants to support organizations and collaboratives addressing health inequities in a defined focus area in order to advance or accelerate efforts to:\n\nProvide culturally and structurally competent services,\n\nAdvance high-impact health equity programming,\n\nSupport collaborative health equity efforts, and/or\n\nAddress root causes of health inequities.\n\nThe fifteen nonprofits receiving this year\u2019s grants are focused on key food insecurity issues, including improving access to nutrient-dense fresh food, providing locally grown produce and job training opportunities, and advancing culturally congruent health education.\n\nIn addition to these grants, HCA Healthcare hosted our third-annual Healthy Food for Healthier Tomorrows Food & Nutrition Drive to help fight against food insecurity. HCA Healthcare, our colleagues and the HCA Healthcare Foundation provided more than 1 million nutritious meals to community food banks by donating food or making financial contributions to help purchase perishable items such as milk, fruit and vegetables.\n\nFor this year\u2019s food drive, hospitals were encouraged to get creative and build sculptures with the donated food before transporting it to their local food banks. The sculpture winner in each division received a $10,000 grant for the food bank serving their community. In addition, there were three national winners selected to receive an additional grant to a food bank in the hospital\u2019s hometown to make an even greater impact.\n\n8. Preparing and responding to natural disasters\n\n(August 2023) On August 30, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida\u2019s Big Bend as a Category 3 major hurricane, before moving into Georgia as a Category 1 hurricane and pushing into South Carolina as a tropical storm. As destructive winds and heavy rainfall progressed across all three states, HCA Healthcare colleagues stood ready to serve those who needed care. Long before a hurricane makes landfall, HCA Healthcare\u2019s disaster response team prepares to ensure continuity of care.\n\nThe Nashville-based EEOC responds to approximately 900 events annually and is comprised of nearly 200 multi-disciplinary leaders, including risk management, clinical experts, supply chain, patient logistics, air and ground transport and community liaison representatives. During hurricane season, EEOC leaders leverage strategic partnerships with weather forecasting agencies and utilize real-time alerting technology to continuously monitor threats and evolve response plans and programs.\n\nHCA Healthcare activated its Nashville-based Enterprise Emergency Operations Center (EEOC), comprised of nearly 200 multi-disciplinary leaders, including risk management, clinical experts, supply chain, patient logistics, air and ground transport and community liaison representatives. In advance of Hurricane Idalia, the EEOC worked alongside local leadership to prepare by distributing key resources to our hospitals, so that colleagues remain safe and patients continue to receive quality care.\n\nWorking across HCA Healthcare\u2019s network, the EEOC can redirect the company\u2019s supply chain to get medical supplies, equipment and care teams to impacted areas to offer assistance. The EEOC prepositions resources, including temporary generators, bulk water and fuel supply. This year, HCA Healthcare stationed Incident Support Unit Trailers equipped with 3,000 Flood Control Barriers and storm readiness equipment, in both its Gulf Coast and West Florida divisions.\n\nIn the event of an evacuation, the company uses EvacuNATE, an algorithm developed by HCA Healthcare, which helps to reduce hospital evacuation time using real-time triage data to track every patient\u2019s movement and where alternative care is available.\n\n(December 2023) In December 2023, we also announced that HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are donating $250,000 to aid those impacted by the tornadoes that recently hit Middle Tennessee. The tornadoes, which touched down the afternoon of Saturday, Dec. 9, 2023, devastated multiple counties across Middle Tennessee, destroying homes and leaving thousands without power.\n\nAdditionally, the HCA Healthcare Hope Fund, an employee-run, employee-supported 501(c)(3) charity that provides financial aid and resources to employees after extended illness, injury, disaster or other special situations, is providing grants to HCA Healthcare colleagues impacted by the tornadoes.\n\nRead more: HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation donate $250,000 to aid tornado relief efforts in Middle Tennessee\n\n9. Advancing comprehensive cancer care with multi-cancer early detection screening\n\n(October 2023) We announced a strategic collaboration with Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute, part of HCA Healthcare, and GRAIL, LLC, a healthcare company with a mission of detecting cancer early when it can be cured, to advance comprehensive cancer care through early detection. On October 17, 2023, GRAIL\u2019s Galleri\u00ae multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test was made available to patients who meet screening criteria at select HCA Healthcare physician practices.\n\nMore than 600,000 people die from cancer each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. This is in large part because some of the deadliest cancers are found too late when outcomes are often poor. Recommended screening tests save lives, but only cover five cancer types in the U.S.: breast, colon, cervical, prostate, and, in high-risk adults, lung. In fact, approximately 70% of cancer deaths have no recommended early detection screening.\n\nThe Galleri test, available by prescription only, is the first clinically validated MCED test that can detect a shared cancer signal across more than 50 types of cancers using a simple blood draw. The MCED test offers a fundamentally different blood-based approach intended to be used in addition to recommended single cancer screenings.\n\nRecognizing the Galleri test is a new paradigm in cancer screening, Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute will leverage its leading nurse navigation program to support patients and providers through the diagnostic journey following a positive Galleri test result. Plans to enhance patient experience and outcomes include standardizing patient and provider education, developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways, and facilitating timely evaluations.\n\nHCA Healthcare is also participating in the PATHFINDER 2 multi-center interventional study of the Galleri test in Nashville, Asheville, Austin, and Denver. The company\u2019s research partner, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) and its contract research organization, will conduct a retrospective study focused on patient and provider outcome-based metrics and quality of care related to MCED testing as part of the initiative.\n\nRead more: HCA Healthcare and GRAIL collaborate to advance comprehensive cancer care with multi-cancer early detection screening\n\n10. HCA Healthcare NICU patients attend prom together\n\n(June 2023) HCA Healthcare has a long history of prioritizing and working to continually improve perinatal safety including Developing evidence-based perinatal protocols through the company\u2019s longstanding partnership with March of Dimes, such as prohibiting elective delivery prior to 39 weeks to help babies have a healthy start to life. This best practice has now been adopted worldwide as a standard of care.\n\nThe story of two HCA Healthcare neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients and March of Dimes families went viral in 2023, detailing how they \u201cmet\u201d as newborns in the NICU at The Children\u2019s Hospital at TriStar Centennial in 2005 went viral. Nearly 18 years later and despite living 200 miles away from each other, the two NICU grads attended prom together this spring.\n\nLeighton was born at the Nashville, Tennessee-based hospital on Aug. 22, at 28 weeks, weighing a little over two pounds. Tatum was born three days later at 24 weeks, weighing just over 1 pound. Once Leighton and Tatum\u2019s families were introduced to each other, they developed a special bond. In addition to the supportive and compassionate care provided by the hospital\u2019s NICU nurses, their mothers found encouragement and life-long friendship in each other.\n\nAfter the families left the hospital, they told Good Morning America that they remained close over the years meeting up for birthday parties, day trips and play dates. It was Tatum who decided to ask Leighton to her senior prom. Leighton was quickly on board with the \u201ccool\u201d idea, and his parents even surprised Tatum with a limo rental for the special occasion. This milestone was a special one for their moms, who recall their babies once being so small and fragile.\n\n\u201cIt is because of each and every nurse that we get to see our babies grow and have such a beautiful friendship. We owe it all to TriStar Centennial.\u201d Laura, mother of HCA Healthcare patient, Tatum\n\nHCA Healthcare nurse Jamie Horton cared for Tatum the day she was born. She now serves as a NICU manager in the 60-bed, Level III NICU caring for babies who are born at less than 32 weeks gestation or are critically ill. The NICU offers a wide range of lifesaving medical services, including life support, pediatric surgical care, respiratory therapy, access to pediatric physician specialists and air transport.\n\n\u201cSeeing this bond between former NICU patients, such as Tatum and Leighton, cements my passion for a job and a NICU that I love so much. I chose to be a NICU nurse to help be a voice for these babies and their parents and to do all I could to make sure they have healthy and wonderful lives ahead of them,\u201d said Jaime. \u201cThey started life with a challenge and have no doubt they\u2019ll handle any other challenge that comes their way. I got to see how tiny Tatum was and how tiny and critical she was on that first day of life. I\u2019m not surprised she is who she is today because she started out as a really strong young lady as a baby, and watching her grow into that has been rewarding.\u201d\n\nGood Morning America article: Tennessee teens, former NICU neighbors, attend prom together\n\nStories to make you smile\n\nJust as a family does, we pull together to care for, support and celebrate with patients and each other. Across HCA Healthcare, we saw a number of stories about the remarkable people at the bedside of our patients resonate with our followers on social media this year. Here\u2019s a look at HCA Healthcare\u2019s top feel-good news stories from 2023.\n\nHCA Healthcare nurse learns baby she helped deliver two decades ago is her daughter-in-law\n\nMary Ann West has been a dedicated labor and delivery nurse with HCA Healthcare affiliate MountainStar Healthcare for more than 25 years. She is one of the nurses proud to welcome the more than 218,000 new babies delivered across our organization annually. This year, Mary Ann experienced a moment of pure serendipity when she discovered that she helped with one very special delivery 22 years ago at HCA Healthcare\u2019s Lakeview Hospital in Utah \u2014 her daughter-in-law.\n\nMary Ann\u2019s son, Tyler, and his fianc\u00e9 Kelsey were looking through old pictures ahead of their May wedding for a slide show when Tyler recognized the nurse who was caring for Kelsey\u2026it was his mother. Mary Ann told Good Morning America the coincidence is remarkable. \u201cWhat are the odds that these two kids would find each other and end up getting married and starting their own little family,\u201d said Mary Ann.\n\nThe labor and delivery nurse said she remembered the day Stacy, Kelsey\u2019s mother, was in labor at Lakeview Hospital due to her nervousness about having three kids under five years old. Additionally, Mary Ann remembered her due to a rare condition Stacy had called velamentous cord insertion \u2013 a complication that occurs in about 1% of single-birth pregnancies. \u201cI remembered Kelsey\u2019s birth because I had never experienced labor like this, before or since. We were all relieved and happy when everything went perfectly and Kelsey was born healthy, without complications. She really is a miracle, and it really does feel like it was meant to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be able to have both of my moms there with me when I was brought into the world is something that not everyone gets to say, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ll be forever grateful for, that I have that connection with her and that she has that connection with my mom, too,\u201d said Kelsey.\n\nHCA Healthcare cancer survivor officiates oncology nurse\u2019s wedding\n\nEach day, our colleagues build strong relationships with their patients during their care journey. This year, we shared the story of how HCA Healthcare patient and cancer survivor Julie Marshall fulfilled her nurse\u2019s wish by officiating her wedding after the two developed a special bond.\n\nDiagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma in the summer of 2021, Julie went through intense treatments of chemotherapy at the Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute at Johnston-Willis Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. During her six-cycle treatment, she formed a close relationship with her care team, which included one of her nurses, Tiffany Knepshield.\n\nWhen Tiffany learned that Julie was a chaplain, she was her first choice when it came time to find someone to officiate her wedding. \u201cStanding on that dock, pronouncing her and her husband as husband and wife was just an honor for me,\u201d Julie recalls.\n\nNow in remission, Julie continues to keep in touch with Tiffany and her new husband. Julie also regularly visits the hospital where she was treated to visit her care team and performed a \u201cBlessing of the Hands\u201d ceremony during National Nurses Week.\n\n\u201cOur relationships with our chemo patients don\u2019t stop after they finish their cycles,\u201d Julie said. \u201cThey\u2019re all a family and we love them so much. It\u2019s awesome to have that connection outside of work. Julie will always be a part of my life now.\u201d\n\nRead WRIC article: Patient officiates her nurse\u2019s wedding after the pair became friends during cancer treatment\n\nHCA Healthcare nurse celebrates 90th birthday and half a century of caring for our patients\n\nEvery day, nurses influence strategies and decisions related to patient care, share best practices and make a difference. For more than 50 years, registered nurse Mattie Schier has served patients at HCA Healthcare affiliate St. David\u2019s Medical Center. Catching the spotlight on HCA Healthcare\u2019s social media channels, Mattie\u2019s fellow colleagues surprised her with a celebration in honor of her 90th birthday.\n\nIgniting her passion for healthcare, Ms. Mattie decided to pursue a career in nursing after learning more about the field from her mother, a licensed vocational nurse. She began working at the Austin, Texas, hospital in 1972 as a nurse in the operating room.\n\nOver the years, she has served in a variety of roles across multiple surgical specialties. Today, she works on the central sterile processing team ensuring surgical instruments are sterilized and prepared for surgery. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being a nurse,\u201d Mattie shared. \u201cI really love interacting with the patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Mattie is a three-time cancer survivor \u2014 battling breast cancer twice and colorectal cancer once. She\u2019s drawn on her personal experiences to give hope, encouragement and compassion to her patients. Mattie shares that throughout her cancer journeys, her hospital family was there for her every step of the way with unwavering support. \u201cThey have just been so wonderful to me and I feel like I need to be wonderful to them and work as long as I can,\u201d Mattie said.\n\nGeorgia HCA Healthcare hospital throws wedding for burn patient\n\nHCA Healthcare patient Preston Cobb and his future bride, Tanesha, had their wedding date marked for July 22, 2023. However, their wedding plans were paused when Preston suffered a severe chemical spill accident on June 30.\n\nPreston was brought to HCA Healthcare affiliate the Joseph M. Still (JMS) Burn Center at Doctors Hospital of Augusta for specialized burn care for the severe burn injuries sustained on 32% of his body. Preston began his hospitalization on a ventilator in the burn intensive care unit (ICU) and eventually required 16 surgeries.\n\nDue to his accident, Preston and Tanesha thought they would have to postpone their wedding date but the JMS Burn Center colleagues were not going to let that happen. Wanting to create a memorable day for Preston and his bride, the hospital team organized a wedding \u2014 complete with a DJ, decorations, a cake, flowers and a photographer. Their family and friends stood by their side at the hospital as they exchanged vows in the hospital\u2019s chapel.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be able to give Preston his wedding day since he was adamant about not changing his date,\u201d shared HCA Healthcare nurse Mary Cook. \u201cI know a lot went into planning his original wedding and I thought if I could do this for him, it would keep his spirits up and give him hope to hold on to because his road to recovery will be tough. I just wanted to give him and his family something positive.\u201d\n\nRead USA Today article: Georgia hospital throws wedding ceremony for couple after groom is severely burned before his big day\n\nNurse\u2019s words of compassion become lifeline for patient\n\nAn act of compassionate care during the pandemic led to a special patient-caregiver reunion in 2023. On January 17, 2020, critical care nurse Lisa Whittaker came to work to care for patients in need as she has for the past 30 years \u2013 five of which have been spent at HCA Healthcare\u2019s Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful, Utah. One patient she cared for that night claims that Lisa is the reason she found the strength to keep fighting to live today.\n\n\u201cI started coming down with these symptoms that I\u2019ve never felt before,\u201d Jennifer recalled, reflecting on the onset of her illness and respiratory failure. The immense pain caused by respiratory issues still lingers vividly in her mind and ultimately required her to be placed on a ventilator in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Lakeview Hospital. The severity of Jennifer\u2019s condition eventually caused her to lose consciousness.\n\nAmid the commotion around her, Jennifer remembered a voice that deeply resonated with her. \u201cSomebody was in my ear saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got you, you are okay.\u2019 I thought it was an angel,\u201d said Jennifer, who spent 10 days in a coma. When Jennifer woke up, she recalled everything that Lisa said on the first night of her coma, January 17. Lisa\u2019s comforting words of reassurance that everything would be okay helped her to fight, despite the severity of her condition.\n\nJennifer recovered and was discharged from the hospital on January 31, 2020, without knowing Lisa\u2019s name. Early this year \u2013 more than three years after leaving the hospital \u2013 Jennifer returned to the with a picture of herself in a hospital bed with the nurse who had given her the strength to keep fighting \u2013 determined to find the nurse with whom she shared this special bond and to say \u2018thank you.\u2019 During National Nurses Month 2023, the two were able to reunite for Jennifer to deliver those words in person with a hug.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "6c535a83-b7d2-41a3-967f-a0bf29fb9398", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

From 2016 to 2020, 33 pregnant and postpartum individuals died from unintentional overdoses\u2014a number tragically comparable to those who died from HIV (36) in the following three years from 2020-2023.\n\nWhile these figures might appear small in isolation, they represent preventable deaths that are driving a disturbing trend. Unintentional overdoses have surged to become the second-leading cause of pregnancy-associated deaths in Colorado, with rates nearly doubling from 15.6% in 2016 to 26.2% in 2020, according to the state's Maternal Mortality Review Committee.\n\nThese aren't just statistics\u2014they're children who grow up without their mothers, families forever changed by preventable loss. This growing crisis has prompted the University of Colorado College of Nursing to take action through their Recovery Coach Doula Program, which is now expanding beyond the Denver metro to reach pregnant people across the Front Range. Services made possible through a $700,000 Opioid Response Strategic Impact Grant from the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Office will reach\u2014in addition to the Denver Metro\u2014Fort Collins and Pueblo.\n\nRecovery Coach Doula Program Partners Integrating Care for Women and Babies (ICWB): a practice facilitator program at CU Anschutz focusing on people with substance use disorder and helping establish relationships with clinical settings that provide care to pregnant and postpartum individuals with substance use disorder.\n\nElephant Circle: A birth and reproductive justice organization is partnering with CU Nursing to train additional recovery coach doulas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge that the state recognizes the program and the need for funding so it can expand and offer essential services,\u201d CU Nursing Assistant Professor Brie Thumm, PhD, CNM, RN, MBA, FACNM, says. \u201cSubstance use is not limited to just Denver or the Denver metro. It\u2019s an issue that needs to be addressed across the state.\u201d\n\nThe grant will fund the program\u2019s expansion for two years, offering support surrounding all phases of pregnancy to more Coloradans. CU Nursing has been collaborating with partners since October 2024 to establish referral systems and coordinate logistics so that doulas can start offering services in early March.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to expand more broadly into Colorado\u2019s rural and frontier communities, so expanding to Pueblo and Fort Collins is the first step since they\u2019re bigger population areas,\u201d Thumm says.\n\nHow the Program Works\n\nThe Recovery Coach Doula Program supports pregnant people with substance use disorder during pregnancy, birth, and the first year after birth. Trained recovery coach doulas (also known as peer support specialists) with specialized doula training meet with patients to offer emotional and physical support, help them adjust to life in recovery, and give insights on pregnancy, birth, substance use, and recovery.\n\n\u201cA recovery coach doula is someone who\u2019s in long-term recovery from substance use disorder,\u201d recovery coach and doula Britt Westmoreland says. \u201cWe use our lived experience and education to support our patients with advocacy and wellness. We also focus on other things like how to find a job, forming healthy relationships, and relapse prevention.\u201d\n\nPatients are referred to the Recovery Coach Doula Program through their prenatal clinics and hospitals.\n\n\u201cEverything is based on the request and needs of the patient. They\u2019re the ones driving the conversation,\u201d Westmoreland says. \u201cThe services are based on how frequently the client wants to see us, and so is the form of communication, whether it\u2019s in-person or virtual.\u201d\n\nA Blueprint for Success\n\nPart of the expansion also includes funding from Colorado\u2019s Behavioral Health Administration to study and implement a blueprint for the program to develop in Colorado and beyond. Liza Creel, PhD, who does healthcare policy research with the CU School of Medicine, will help study the program\u2019s sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re figuring out how all of the support and services we\u2019re developing at the Anschutz Campus can reach people in different settings,\u201d Thumm says. \u201cThere are challenges for sustainability in rural areas, including geographic dispersion of clients and client volume, so we need to research how to make this program sustainable for not only clients but employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has always been one of my long-term goals,\u201d Westmoreland says. \u201cThe grant funding is showing enough people want us to succeed. I\u2019m hopeful in the future we can use this blueprint to expand services not only in Colorado but in other states.\u201d", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu", "article_id": "b3dedc41-0266-4851-ba5e-7b6daea713b6", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)\n\nThis story originally appeared in Stateline.\n\nDespite an encouraging national dip in the past year, overdose deaths are still on the rise in many Western states as the epicenter of the nation\u2019s continuing crisis shifts toward the Pacific Coast, where deadly fentanyl and also methamphetamine are finding more victims.\n\nOverdose deaths remain sharply higher since 2019. Many states are working on \u201charm reduction\u201d strategies that stress cooperation with people who use drugs; in some cases, states are getting tougher on prosecutions, with murder charges for dealers.\n\nAlaska, Nevada, Washington and Oregon have moved into the top 10 for rate of overdose deaths since 2023, according to a Stateline analysis of federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Meanwhile the biggest one-year improvements were in Nebraska (down 30%), North Carolina (down 23%), and Vermont, Ohio and Pennsylvania (all down 19%).\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nThe spread of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can cause overdose and death even in tiny amounts, explains much of the east-to-west movement in the number of deaths, said Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention program at Vital Strategies, an international advocacy group that works on strengthening public health.\n\n\u201cFentanyl really came in through the traditional drug markets in the Northeast, but you can see this steady movement westward,\u201d Heller said. \u201cSo now we\u2019re seeing overdoses going up on the West Coast while they\u2019re going down dramatically on the East Coast.\u201d\n\nThe provisional CDC data estimates drug overdose deaths in the year ending with April 2024, and nationally they decreased by 10%, with more than 11,000 fewer deaths than the year before. But they\u2019re still rising in 10 states and the District of Columbia, including 42% in Alaska, 22% in Oregon, 18% in Nevada and 14% in Washington state. Deaths climbed by almost 1,300 in those states and others with more modest increases: Colorado, Utah and Hawaii.\n\nExperts are still debating why some Eastern states hit early in the overdose crisis are seeing improvements.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some kind of improvement spreading from east to west and we don\u2019t know exactly what it is yet. Everybody sees their little piece of the elephant,\u201d said Nabarun Dasgupta, a scientist specializing in opioid disorder and overdose at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nIn North Carolina and other states with recent improvements, \u201cit feels like we finally got a lid on the pot, but the pot is still boiling over. Things aren\u2019t really cooling down,\u201d Dasgupta said.\n\nIt could be a result of better acceptance of harm reduction policies to help those who use drugs, including no-questions-asked testing of street drugs and providing naloxone to counteract overdoses. Or users may simply be getting more wary of fentanyl and its dangers and unpleasant side effects, Dasgupta said.\n\n\u201cFentanyl is very potent, but potency isn\u2019t the only thing. Otherwise we\u2019d all be drinking the highest proof IPAs (India pale ales),\u201d Dasgupta said.\n\nAlaska now has the nation\u2019s second-highest rate of drug overdose deaths, about 53 per 100,000 population, behind only West Virginia (73 per 100,000). Other Western states that are now in the top 10: Nevada (47 per 100,000), Washington state (46 per 100,000) and Oregon (45 per 100,000).\n\nThe CDC data shows Alaska had the largest increase from 2023 \u2014 up 42%, to 390 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy in August 2023 proposed legislation making fentanyl dealers subject to murder charges in overdose death cases, writing: \u201cDrugs and drug overdoses have had a devastating effect on our state.\u201d The legislation was signed into law this year.\n\nIn May, the state kicked off \u201cOne Pill Can Kill,\u201d a national\u00a0awareness campaign\u00a0warning about the dangers of fentanyl.\n\nFentanyl, mostly in the form of counterfeit 30 mg oxycodone pills, has become tremendously profitable for smugglers in Alaska who make use of airline passengers and air shipments of other products to get drugs into the state, said state Department of Public Safety spokesperson Austin McDaniel. Pills that sell for less than $1 near the U.S. southern border with Mexico can fetch $20 in Alaska, McDaniel said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make the dealers think twice about targeting Alaska,\u201d said Alaska state Rep. Craig Johnson, an Anchorage Republican, who supported the bill signed into law July 12.\n\nJohnson\u2019s 23-year-old nephew died of a fentanyl overdose two years ago. \u201cThis is personal. I don\u2019t want other Alaska families to go through what we went through. I hope we never have to use it, because that will mean nobody else died.\u201d\n\nOther state and federal authorities are also trying a more punitive approach to the fentanyl crisis: Under a state program in Wisconsin meant to ferret out suppliers, three people were arrested in September and charged with first-degree reckless homicide in the fentanyl overdose death of a 27-year-old man. In Michigan, two men pleaded guilty this month to federal charges in a mass fentanyl poisoning that led to at least six deaths.\n\nSuch punitive approaches can backfire, experts say, if they drive people toward more dangerous solitary drug use \u2014 where no one can see an overdose and try to help \u2014 and away from programs such as free testing to unearth fentanyl hidden in other drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of nonsensical, like saying you can beat something out of people. People are still going to use drugs,\u201d said Heller, of Vital Strategies. \u201cThis should be a call to action to wake up and really invest in a response to drug use as a health issue.\u201d\n\nIn Nevada, health authorities in the Las Vegas area are stressing more cooperation with residents who use drugs, increasing naloxone distribution and encouraging people to submit their drug purchases for testing so they\u2019re not surprised by counterfeit heroin, methamphetamine or other drugs that are increasingly cut with cheaper fentanyl, said Jessica Johnson, health education supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.\n\nA state office coordinates goals for county naloxone distribution based on factors such as hospital reports of overdoses. More overdoses trigger more naloxone distribution to community centers, clinics, entertainment venues and even vending machines.\n\nOne puzzle in Nevada and in other states is that increasingly, overdoses involve a combination of opioids, such as fentanyl, along with stimulants such as methamphetamine. Almost a third of overdoses in Nevada are caused by both being used together, according to a state report based on 2022 data.\n\nIt feels like we finally got a lid on the pot, but the pot is still boiling over. Things aren\u2019t really cooling down.\n\n\u2013 Nabarun Dasgupta, University of North Carolina Injury Prevention Research Center\n\nIt could be that some people seek the \u201croller coaster of effects using a stimulant like methamphetamine and a depressant like fentanyl or heroin,\u201d Jessica Johnson said, but mostly she hears that unsuspecting users get cocaine or methamphetamine that\u2019s been cut with cheaper fentanyl.\n\n\u201cWe get people saying, \u2018Oh I don\u2019t need naloxone because I don\u2019t use fentanyl,\u2019 and our team is able to say, \u2018Well, our surveillance data actually suggests there might be fentanyl in your methamphetamine\u2019 or whatever it is.\u201d\n\nNationally, both drugs are increasingly a factor in fatal overdoses: Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl contributed to 68% of overdose deaths in this year\u2019s CDC data, up from 48% in 2019. Stimulants such as methamphetamine were factors in 35% of deaths, up from 20% in 2019.\n\nHeroin and other partly natural opioids, such as oxycodone, have diminished as factors, together accounting for 13% of deaths in the latest data compared with 40% in 2019.\n\nSome experts theorize that the high potency of fentanyl makes those who use drugs want to tweak or balance the effect with methamphetamine. Fentanyl itself is often cut with xylazine, a non-opioid animal tranquilizer \u2014 often known as \u201ctranq\u201d \u2014 that can cause unpleasant side effects, including extreme sedation and skin lesions, Dasgupta said.\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, there were a lot of reasons why people were using substances more. Now that things are different, people are tired of the adulteration, the sedation, the skin wounds,\u201d Dasgupta said. \u201cPeople may take lower doses, and that in itself can help lower overdoses.\u201d\n\nStateline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

I was taking care of myself mentally and physically. My relationship was solid.\u201d\n\nThen, during a routine medical exam while serving in the military in California, doctors discovered he had Atrial Fibrillation, or AFib.\n\n\u201cAtrial fibrillation is a rhythm disorder of the upper chambers of the heart during which the upper chambers lose the mechanical function, so they don\u2019t contract,\u201d Andrea Natale, M.D., executive medical director of the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute (TCAI) at St. David\u2019s Medical Center, said.\n\n\u201cSuddenly everything changes, and I\u2019m not able to work out anymore. I may not live as long as I expected,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cThese were all emotional shocks for my wife and me to learn.\u201d\n\nIn just five years, Wiseman underwent 10 cardioversions, four ablations and one failed surgery to treat his AFib, but all were unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cAfter my third ablation, the cardiologist that I have out in Denver, they looked into alternatives to where I could go across the country and they were saying, \u2018We\u2019ve done the best we can. We don\u2019t want to take any more risks than we feel comfortable taking. We\u2019re going to send you to the best guy that we have in the country,\u2019\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cSo they sent me to Dr. Natale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe typical age of a person with AFib is about late 50s, early 60s, so Ryan is clearly an exception, but this is a genetic disease,\u201d Dr. Natale said. \u201cUnfortunately, because the upper chamber is not contracting, AFib can increase the risk of stroke and heart failure.\u201d\n\nAFib is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting millions of Americans. AFib can cause blood to pool and form clots in the left atrial appendage (LAA). If a blood clot breaks loose, it can travel to the brain, causing a stroke.\n\nApproximately 20 percent of all strokes occur in patients with AFib, and AFib-related strokes are more frequently fatal and disabling. The most common treatment to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AFib is the use of blood-thinning warfarin medication. Despite its proven efficacy, long-term warfarin medication is not well-tolerated by some patients, and it carries a significant risk for bleeding complications.\n\nAs a result, doctors decided to close Wiseman\u2019s LAA mechanically using the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device.\n\nThe WATCHMAN Implant is a permanent implant designed to close the LAA to keep harmful blood clots from the LAA from entering the bloodstream. By closing off the LAA, the risk of stroke may be reduced, and over time, patients may be able to stop taking warfarin.\n\n\u201cImagine an umbrella that springs out and closes it,\u201d Dr. Natale said.\n\n\u201cTo eliminate my stroke risk and not have to be on blood thinners anymore\u2014that\u2019s huge for me,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cBeing able to go back to running and not having to worry about falling down or somebody hitting me in the chest. I make jokes about it with friends, \u2018Hey don\u2019t hit me in the chest. I\u2019m on blood thinners, I might die.\u2019 To a certain degree, it\u2019s kind of funny, but also at the same time it\u2019s a real life-threatening risk that if I fall down some stairs, I may not get back up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is true for any patient, not just Ryan, but for him, it\u2019s more important because he\u2019s a young parent, so he has to take care of young kids\u2014 and at the same time, he has to make sure he can financially provide for his family,\u201d Dr. Natale said. \u201cSo it\u2019s actually very important.\u201d\n\nNow, at 32 years of age, Wiseman has bounced back.\n\n\u201cI feel really great, which is an awesome place to be,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cWhen you have atrial fibrillation, your heart isn\u2019t pumping as efficiently and, in general, you feel bad. And in general, I feel good\u2014which is awesome.\u201d\n\nThe WATCHMAN was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2015. Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute was involved in clinical trials to study its effectiveness in the United States for nearly a decade, and it was the first facility in Texas to implant the WATCHMAN device in a patient with non-valvular AFib in 2015.\n\nSt. David\u2019s Healthcare, an affiliate of HCA Healthcare, is a network of hospitals in the Austin, Texas area.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com", "article_id": "d733e8b0-1fc8-4e16-b65d-5db806acf939", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Capt. Jordan Simonson, 21st Medical Squadron psychologist, opened his office door Monday and is slated to begin treating patients in early October.\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin native did his undergraduate work in psychology and sociology at the University of Wisconsin and completed his doctorate in clinical psychology at Seattle Pacific University.\n\n\n\nHe earned his Air Force commission soon after, then spent a year in residency at Joint Base Andrews, Md.\n\n\n\n\"Residency was pretty intense,\" Simonson said. \"It's all about making you an Air Force psychologist through clinical practice. You work extremely long hours and treat a lot of patients. During the year, you conduct group and individual therapy, alcohol and drug treatment and other kinds of behavioral medicine.\"\n\n\n\nThe avid cyclist and runner found it difficult to contain his excitement upon learning of this assignment.\n\n\n\n\"I'm looking forward to riding and running here in Colorado and now I've got the chance to ski and do more mountain-oriented activities,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSporting activities aside, Simonson is most excited about his new job and duty station.\n\n\n\n\"While I was in residency I hoped I might get the chance to start a new program, but figured I would instead be assigned to an existing unit where I would serve as the youngest psychologist,\" he said. \"I feel extremely fortunate to get this opportunity. I couldn't have hoped for a better first assignment.\"\n\n\n\nHere, Simonson will treat patients, but he also has an opportunity to develop a mental health program from scratch.\n\n\n\n\"Very few Air Force psychologists come right out of residency and get to have their own program. That's pretty cool. There will be some challenges such as figuring out all of our operating procedures and all of the hiccups that come with starting something new. So, at this point I'm trying to smooth out the bumps along the road and get up and running,\" Simonson said.\n\n\n\nHe said one of the biggest draws to working as an Air Force psychologist was knowing of the urgent need. And, he's looking forward to the opportunity to deploy in the future.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's important in many circumstances to provide mental health treatment as early as possible,\" he said. \"Early treatment has shown to be most effective for people who experience traumatic events and you can't get any earlier intervention than at a deployed location.\"\n\n\n\nSimonson's primary role here will be providing patient care, including individual therapy and potentially group therapy if he sees an interest for it. Down the road, he envisions the mental health clinic providing alcohol and drug treatment as well. He'll also lead the clinic in its outreach, education and training programs.\n\n\n\n\"We are very excited about the arrival of our new psychologist, as this will be the first-ever full-time mental health services program available to our patients right here at Schriever,\" said 21st MDS Commander Lt. Col. Brent Sonday. \"This is such a great benefit for our active duty and dependent patients to have access to this valuable service in our Schriever clinic.\"\n\n\n\nTo find more about services available at the Schriever Medical Clinic, visit the clinic in Building 220 or call 567-4455.\n\nNEWS INFO Date Taken: 09.12.2013 Date Posted: 09.12.2013 15:16 Story ID: 113542 Location: COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, US Web Views: 126 Downloads: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN This work, 21 MDS welcomes Schriever's first psychologist, by PA Workflow, identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.", "source_domain": "www.dvidshub.net", "article_id": "3cbc5473-5ee6-4c56-8f32-d60558c9a9e0", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

Proposals then must be vetted by the state\u2019s Title Board, and then proponents must gather some 125,000 voter signatures to make the ballot. For measures amending the constitution, those signatures must include at least 2% of the total voters in each of Colorado\u2019s 35 state senate districts.\n\nKeep in mind these initiatives would be for the 2026 election.\n\nThe initiatives filed by Fields and Taheri were:\n\nInitiatives 14 and 15 would make it a Level 1 drug felony, punishable by up to 32 years in prison, to distribute, manufacture or sell any amount of drug or drug compound that contains fentanyl, carfentanil, benzimidazole opiate or an analog of one of those drugs. Right now, it\u2019s only a Level 1 drug felony if someone distributes, manufactures or sells more than 50 grams of those drugs. Initiative 15 would also make it a Level 4 drug felony to knowingly possess more than 6 milligrams of fentanyl, carfentanil, benzimidazole opiate or an analog of one of those drugs, or a compound containing those drugs. That would be down from 4 grams.\n\nInitiative 16 would amend the state constitution to require voter approval for any fee with projected revenue more than $100 million total in its first five fiscal years, starting in 2027.\n\nInitiatives 17 and 18 would amend the state constitution to require, starting in 2027, that any bills passed by the legislature \u201cwith a projected negative impact to the state gross domestic product\u201d of more than $100 million in its first five calendar years to be put to a statewide vote.\n\nInitiative 19 would amend the state constitution to declare that government regulations \u201crestricting or banning common use products and services, such as gas-powered vehicles, stoves, heaters and lawnmowers,\u201d create a severe financial burden. It would block those kinds of bans, based on energy source, from being imposed by state and local governments.\n\nInitiative 20 would reduce Colorado\u2019s individual and corporate income tax rates to 4.35% in 2027 and 4.2% in 2028, down from 4.4%. Initiative 21 would drop the rates to 4.2% starting in 2027.\n\nInitiative 22 would amend the state constitution to declare that families and students have a right to school choice. It\u2019s similar to Amendment 80, which voters rejected in November.\n\nInitiative 23 would declare that \u201cstate and local law enforcement must cooperate with federal requests to notify the Department of Homeland Security\u201d before releasing inmates charged with a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in state law or if the inmate has been convicted of a prior felony.

It\u2019s a playbook he\u2019s used before with success on property taxes.\n\n\u201cWe urge the legislature to pass a law mirroring our ballot measure so that Colorado statute mandates cooperation with federal authorities to detain and deport violent criminals and repeat felons who endanger our communities and families,\u201d Fields said in a written statement. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be optional to take criminals who are here illegally out of our state. It should be mandatory.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in the legislature in recent years have passed laws prohibiting state and local law enforcement in Colorado from assisting federal immigration agents beyond the scope of their criminal investigations. They\u2019re unlikely to budge given the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation plans.\n\nFields declined to comment further on any of the measures he filed.\n\nThese measures are probably just Fields\u2019 opening salvo. We\u2019re a long way out from 2026.\n\nOTHER BALLOT MEASURES\n\nA few other notable ballot measures have been filed with Legislative Council Staff.\n\nInitiative 25 would repeal the state\u2019s retail delivery fee, which raised funds for transportation projects.\n\nInitiative 13 would end wolf reintroduction in 2026, while Initiative 10 would repeal the 2020 ballot measure to reintroduce wolves. The measures were filed by former El Paso County Commissioner Stan VanderWerf and Spencer Thomas of Garfield County.\n\nand of Garfield County. Initiative 12 would make Colorado a right-to-work state, meaning that all employees at a company couldn\u2019t be forced to pay representation fees, whether they are in a union or not. It was filed by conservative activist Jon Caldara, amid legislative negotiations to change the state\u2019s Labor Peace Act.\n\nTHE NARRATIVE\n\nThe curious case of TABOR\u2019s vanishing people\n\nA vanishing \u201cWelcome to Colorful Colorado\u201d sign. (Photo illustration by Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun)\n\nNearly 24,000 Coloradans are set to disappear from the state\u2019s population this year \u2014 at least as far as the state budget is concerned.\n\nIt\u2019s no mere illusion.\n\nThe vanishing act will have real consequences for public services, to the tune of $77 million in required cuts, if lawmakers don\u2019t take action to prevent it.\n\nThe issue dates all the way back to when the legislature first implemented the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights in 1993, the year after voters added it to the state constitution.\n\nObligatory TABOR refresher: The state constitution generally limits state revenue to the combined rate of consumer inflation and population growth. TABOR requires the state to use U.S. Census Bureau estimates to determine the population, but the legislature ultimately decides exactly how the growth rate should be calculated.\n\nFor the past 32 years, the state has used a formula that leads to undercounts in some years and overcounts in others, a Colorado Legislative Council staff analysis found. And it doesn\u2019t necessarily even out.\n\nNext budget year, the formula will result in the state losing 24,000 people to an undercount, trimming the TABOR growth rate by 0.4 percentage points. That has the Joint Budget Committee considering a once-in-a-generation change to how the state calculates the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights revenue cap.\n\nThe current calculation, said Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat and vice chair of the JBC, \u201cisn\u2019t really reflective of reality.\u201d\n\nMath warning: We\u2019re going to walk you through the numbers, so bear with us for a second.\n\nEach December, the Census Bureau releases new estimates for what the population was on July 1 of any given year. So for 2024, Colorado had an estimated population of 5,957,493.\n\nThe 2023 population estimate used in last year\u2019s TABOR cap was 5,877,610. So from one budget year to the next, the population grew by 79,883 people, or 1.4%.\n\nThat\u2019s the rate the JBC wants to use in next year\u2019s budget. But that\u2019s not how population growth is calculated under state law today.\n\nEach December, the Census Bureau tries to correct mistakes from previous years. Under the most recent estimates, the state\u2019s population was actually 5,901,339 in 2023 \u2014 about 24,000 more than last year\u2019s estimate. That means that from 2023 to 2024, the state\u2019s population only grew by 56,154 people \u2014 a 1% growth rate for TABOR purposes.\n\nOn the surface, that seems like a reasonable way to calculate growth. After all, why wouldn\u2019t you use the most current estimates available?\n\nThe problem is, the state can\u2019t go back and correct this year\u2019s TABOR cap to reflect higher growth. Colorado didn\u2019t get credit for those 24,000 people in this year\u2019s budget, because the cap was set with the smaller estimate from December 2023. And it won\u2019t get credit for them in next year\u2019s budget either, because the state\u2019s population is growing off the new, higher population estimate.\n\n\u201cI actually think the 1% (growth rate under current law) is a better reflection of how much Colorado\u2019s population grew in 2024,\u201d Greg Sobetski, the chief economist for Colorado Legislative Council staff, told the JBC this week. \u201cThe issue is that the 1% misses people who ought to have been included in the count of Colorado\u2019s population in 2023. They weren\u2019t, and our current methodology never lets them be counted at all.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unless state law changes, TABOR will make those 24,000 people disappear.\n\nWant to reach Colorado political influencers and support quality local journalism?

Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat who isn\u2019t up for reelection until 2028, sent out a fundraising email Wednesday night touting his questioning of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during a confirmation hearing for Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cI pressed RFK Jr. on his long history of spouting conspiracy theories, which is disqualifying for anyone seeking public office, but especially for someone nominated to be the highest health official in America,\u201d Bennet wrote in the email. \u201cIf you stand with common sense and against RFK Jr.\u2019s conspiracy theories, please stand with me today. I\u2019m doing everything in my power to make sure he does not become our next Secretary of Health and Human Services.\u201d\n\nCOLORADO GOP\n\nThe Colorado GOP central committee meeting Thursday night was nothing short of a cluster.\n\nChairman Dave Williams called the meeting to vote on a number of party bylaw amendments aimed at making it easier for the party to endorse candidates and opt out of the state\u2019s primary elections, as well as make it harder to remove party officers. The proposals drew a major rebuke from the four Republicans in the state\u2019s congressional delegation, who accused Williams of being \u201cdivisive\u201d and attempting to consolidate power.\n\nThe gathering was held virtually over Zoom, and immediately drew a parliamentary challenge.\n\nA central committee member complained that the party\u2019s meeting rules were violated because the government-issued ID\u2019s of participants weren\u2019t checked as required. Williams rejected the challenge, but, on appeal, the central committee narrowly voted to overrule the chairman, at which point he abruptly ended the meeting after an hour and a half.\n\nBefore the meeting ended, Williams clashed with U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert and state Rep. Ron Weinberg. Williams accused his opponents of trying to disrupt the gathering and played down the parliamentary challenge.\n\nELECTION 2026\n\nState Rep.

He is a lead sponsor of the Labor Peace Act bill. (Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun)\n\nGov. Jared Polis has made it clear that Senate Bill 5, the Labor Peace Act measure, is a nonstarter as introduced. But what\u2019s unclear is whether the Colorado labor movement is willing to amend the legislation to get it to a place where Polis may be willing to sign it.\n\nSenate Bill 5 would eliminate a requirement that 75% of workers at a company sign off before a union can negotiate with an employer on union security, which is when workers are forced to pay collective bargaining representation fees regardless of their union participation. Business groups are fighting the change.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and a lead sponsor of the measure, said \u201cthere are some conversations happening\u201d between proponents of the bill, but that \u201cformal offers have not been (made) at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that at least conversations have started happening,\u201d he said.\n\nRogridguez said the governor\u2019s office has not been involved with his discussions with the business community. He said Polis\u2019 representatives told him the two sides should work it out among themselves.\n\n\u201cWhere we\u2019ll get to is what both sides are probably going to hate, which is sometimes a good thing,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anything that\u2019s offered will even get the governor (to a point where he could sign it).\u201d\n\nThe governor has said he\u2019s open to reducing the 75% threshold, but Rodriguez said it\u2019s not clear to him that the labor movement would be willing to go there in exchange for dropping the union security vote altogether.\n\nPurplish: The embattled Labor Peace Act\n\n\u2014 Colorado Public Radio and The Colorado Sun\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE\n\n\ud83d\udd11 = source has article meter or paywall\n\nThe Colorado Sun is part of The Trust Project.

Sydney, who is deaf and suffers from cerebral palsy and seizures, uses a feeding tube and a wheelchair. With a surgery scheduled for the following week, Laura, 42, says she knew the photos would have to happen on that rainy Sunday on July 15.\n\n\u201cWe needed to get the pictures done before the surgery,\u201d Laura tells PEOPLE. \u201cI was very nervous that we\u2019d have to cancel.

There they met 20-year-old Christian Lopez who agreed to the photo shoot. But the supervisor took his kindness a step further, lending his umbrella and helping the women unload their car.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible. He was almost like our knight in shining armor. I couldn\u2019t believe how nice this kid was,\u201d Laura says. \u201cHe had gotten Sydney a towel, they dried her off. And he was making all of us hot chocolate!

Medications such as buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone often are used to treat opioid dependence and help patients achieve recovery, while naloxone is used to quickly reverse instances of opioid overdose.\n\nDetails and Objectives\n\nWestfall explained to AAFP News that the HOMER trial originated from a prior study, \u201cImplementing Technology and Medication-Assisted Treatment and Team Training in Rural Colorado,\u201d which was aimed at increasing the use of MAT for OUD among rural practices in the state.\n\n\u201cWe heard from many patients, physicians and practices questions about what is the best way to start a patient on treatment,\u201d said Westfall. \u201cThe start of treatment for OUD is called induction and, while there are several evidence-based methods, there has not been a comparative effectiveness trial to determine the best method. Even more important may be identifying which patient is most likely to benefit from which induction method.\u201d\n\nPractices selected for participation in the HOMER trial will be asked to identify six to 20 patients who have opioid dependence or OUD and who have opted to receive MAT with buprenorphine.\n\nIdentified patients will then be randomized to receive MAT in one of three methods:\n\noffice-based induction, during which patients discontinue opioid use, begin withdrawal and receive the first few doses of buprenorphine in the clinic setting, with additional monitoring from clinic staff and the prescribing physician;\n\nhome induction, in which patients can stop opioids at any time and start buprenorphine when they reach the appropriate level of withdrawal; or\n\ntelehealth induction, in which the patient undergoes the same process as an office-based induction, but from a location other than the clinic, with contact between patients, clinic staff and the prescribing physician by phone or video.\n\nInduction, Westfall said, \u201cis a crucial first step to long-term treatment. One must successfully complete MAT induction to move on to MAT stabilization and, ultimately, MAT maintenance.\u201d\n\nWestfall said that research to determine the best method of MAT induction is lacking, as is research that indicates which patients would derive the most benefit from each method.\n\nAs such, the HOMER study\u2019s aims are to\n\ncompare short-term stabilization and long-term maintenance treatment engagement in MAT among patients who receive home-based, office-based or telehealth induction; and\n\nidentify which clinically relevant practice and patient characteristics are associated with successful long-term treatment.\n\nPractices selected for participation will undergo training beginning in March 2021. During the trial, participating practices will have access to a variety of MAT resources, including treatment forms, protocols and guidelines.\n\nPatient enrollment will occur for 12 months beginning in April 2021. Patients who participate in the trial will be monitored and their data tracked for nine months. During this time they will be asked to complete a series of surveys related to quality of life, self-reported opioid use and other measures. Clinic staff and prescribing physicians may also be asked to complete surveys or participate in interviews.\n\nOverall, the trial will run for three years and is expected to enroll 1,200 to 1,400 patients to allow for attrition.\n\nHow You Can Participate\n\nOne hundred primary care practices throughout the United States are expected to be involved in the trial. Although the recruitment period runs through February 2021, FPs who want to participate are highly encouraged to submit a study interest form at their earliest convenience.\n\nWestfall explained how FPs individually, and the specialty in general, could benefit from taking part in the study.\n\n\u201cFamily doctors are on the front lines of the opioid epidemic,\u201d Westfall said. \u201cWe see lots of patients with opioid use disorder, and many want to get help. Too often, the big universities do these studies on a very narrow spectrum of patients and just expect family doctors to use that evidence, but evidence created at the academic medical center may not actually be the best evidence for a primary care practice.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.aafp.org", "article_id": "81a7fdfa-4d59-4cf4-a58b-2614d2ad616f", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}
{"url": "https://www.cdc.gov/rural-health/php/policy-briefs/child-mental-health-policy-brief.html", "title": "Child Mental Health: Rural Policy Brief", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Telemedicine is the general use of technology to provide health services, and telemental health refers to mental health services provided at a distance.7\n\nTelemental health could increase access for all rural Americans by allowing the existing mental health workforce to reach people who don't have access to in-person services.\n\nWhile telemental health has been used more with adults than children, pediatric use is increasing.6Although telemental health is a promising option for expanding access to care, there are some barriers to widespread adoption and use (including pediatric use).\n\nInsurance coverage for telemedicine\n\nTelemedicine services are governed by federal and state laws, and regulation varies considerably because each state defines telemedicine services differently. These definitions determine the services that qualify for reimbursement under Medicaid and private insurance.8\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) encourages states to \"use the flexibility built into Medicaid to create innovative payment methodologies for services that incorporate telemedicine technology.\"9 Here are examples of how some states handle payment:\n\n48 states and the District of Columbia provide some level of Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine. 10\n\n39 states have some form of Medicaid coverage and reimbursement for telemental health services. 1112\n\nOn the private payer side, 32 states and the District of Columbia have private payer policies in place for telehealth. However. these policies differ considerably in which services are covered and how much providers are reimbursed. 813\n\n23 states and the District of Columbia require that payments for telemental health services be equivalent to those received for in-office treatment. 14\n\nSome evidence shows that when telemedicine is not reimbursed or is reimbursed at a lower level than in-person services, providers may not have sufficient financial incentives to provide telemedicine services. 15To increase adoption of telemedicine, states could consider adopting private payer parity laws.16 More research is needed to determine the effect that parity laws may have on the adoption and use of telemental health.\n\nLicensure requirements\n\nEach state establishes licensure requirements for healthcare professionals who practice within their borders. The unique nature of telemedicine services could allow doctors and mental health providers to easily provide services across state lines. However, many states' licensure requirements limit this possibility.\n\nThese licensure laws cover physicians as well as psychologists, social workers, nurses, and pharmacists. 17Some evidence suggests that adding licensing requirements for professionals who practice across state lines may slow or limit the expansion of telemedicine technologies by some healthcare facilities.16\n\nTo deal with this emerging issue, states have established several options for licensing telemedicine practitioners:\n\nEight states accept conditional or telemedicine licenses from out-of-state physicians.\n\nThree states have established registries that permit qualifying out-of-state physicians to practice in the states.\n\n18 states have adopted the Federation of State Medical Boards' compact. This \"enforces an expedited license for out-of-state practice\" for doctors, including psychiatrists. 18\n\nSimilar multistate agreements that would include other mental health professionals, such as psychologists, are in the early stages of development. 14\n\nEvidence of effectiveness\n\nEvidence suggests that telemental health services can be effective for underserved populations, such as rural Americans.19 Telemental health can also:\n\nEffectively treat underserved children with specific conditions, such as ADHD. 20\n\nMeet the broader behavioral health needs of children and adolescents.\n\nSuccessfully meet the psychiatric needs of rural children. 21\n\nAlthough these studies demonstrate effectiveness for these specific populations, more evidence is needed to support the use of telemental health for the broader population of rural children with MBDDs. In rural areas, adoption of new interventions and methods often outpaces research into the potential effectiveness of expanding those programs.22\n\nMore rigorous research into these innovative approaches can expand the evidence base and may increase adoption of telemedicine services and interventions for treating rural children with MBDDs.\n\nChallenges\n\nPrivacy. Providers must ensure that patient privacy and confidentiality are maintained at the same level as with an in-person visit. 23\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) created \"national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information (PHI).\"24 Telemental health providers handling PHI must follow the same HIPAA requirements as for in-person meetings. 25\n\nCost.

It just makes me feel kind of special when I do that some days,\" said Amelia van der Merwe.\n\nShe was born two months early and had to have heart surgery. But soon after her parents realized something was wrong.\n\n\"She started not making the typical milestones of children, you know, not crawling when she should,\" said Amelia's mother, Robin van der Merwe.\n\nThat's when she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy by doctors at Children's Health.\n\n\"When they tell you your child has spastic hemiplegia cerebral palsy, it's a lot to take in at one time because the first thing you start to think about is what does that mean for their future? You know, what does that look like? What is she going to be able to do or what is she not going to be able to do?,\" said Robin van der Merwe.\n\nDoctors painted a picture of what her life might be like.\n\n\"She said, well, she'll probably always be a little clumsy, meaning that her balance would not be very good. She wouldn't be able to play team sports, just because she would not have that same physical capability as other children,\" said Robin van der Merwe.\n\nAmelia's parents credit her team of doctors at Children's Health who immediately stepped in to rewrite Amelia's future. She was put in leg braces before she turned two and has had surgery on her left leg, injections and intensive therapy to strengthen her muscles.\n\n\"There were just never any limitations. There wasn't anyone who said, this is what it's going to look like forever. It was 'we're going to make her the very best that we can',\" said Robin van der Merwe.\n\nToday there are no limits to what she can do. Her favorite hobby is kicking a soccer ball.\n\n\"I actually kind of like that because even little kids like me can do big things,\" said Amelia.\n\nHer parents hope her story inspires other parents whose children are dealing with difficult medical diagnoses.\n\n\"If I knew then what I know right now, I wouldn't have felt nearly as bad as I did. You know, ten years ago, because I would know that the outcome would be so fantastic,\" said Robin van der Merwe. \"It's been a lot but the result is a girl who's free to choose to do anything she wants to do.\"\n\nAmelia's long and continuing journey has inspired her too.\n\n\"I have a lot of things I want to be when I grow up, but the one thing that I really want to be is a doctor,\" said Amelia. \"These doctors I've been meeting over the years, they've inspired me when I when I keep seeing them taking care of kids, I thought to myself, I want to do the same thing. I want to help kids to do things that they couldn't do. I want to make their dream come true.\"", "source_domain": "www.cbsnews.com", "article_id": "5ee5ab40-361f-4ae6-9515-7047ad035392", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)\n\nColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a brief Tuesday outlining the state\u2019s arguments defending a 2019 Colorado law that bans conversion therapy for minors in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe case concerns a Colorado state law that bans conversion therapy, the practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation, such as to eliminate same-sex attraction, or gender identity. Conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom represents the plaintiff, Kaley Chiles, a Colorado Springs counselor who argues the Colorado law violates a counselor\u2019s right to free speech by prohibiting certain conversations related to gender and sexuality.\u00a0\n\nThe named defendant in the case is Patty Salazar, executive director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. The Supreme Court decided to hear the case in March, and will hear arguments in the case during its term that starts in October.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nColorado law protects patients from receiving \u201csubstandard care\u201d and that conversion therapy has been regulated in the U.S. for more than a century, Weiser said in a press conference Tuesday. He said the law does not prohibit a provider from \u201csharing information, content, or viewpoints with a patient,\u201d and therapists are still permitted to tell patients about conversion practices offered by religious entities or others.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a First Amendment objection to protecting patients and prohibiting substandard \u2026 care regardless of whether or not the care is carried out through words,\u201d Weiser said.\u00a0\n\nAbout half of U.S. states and Washington, D.C., ban conversion therapy, and the American Medical Association opposes it. The Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that advocates equality for all LGBTQ+ people, says \u201cevery mainstream medical and mental health organization\u201d has rejected the practice for decades and that it can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide, particularly for minors.\u00a0\n\nThe 2019 law prohibits licensed psychiatrists and mental health care providers from \u201cengaging in conversion therapy\u201d with patients under 18 years old. Providers who conduct conversion therapy are subject to disciplinary action from the appropriate licensing board, though Weiser said the state hasn\u2019t taken disciplinary action against any providers since the law went into effect.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere have never been any disciplinary actions against the therapist in this case,\u201d Weiser said of Chiles. \u201cNone of what the therapist is alleging actually appears to violate Colorado law, because she says that she\u2019s not trying to change a patient\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d\u00a0\n\nChiles\u2019 petition to the Supreme Court says she is a practicing Christian who \u201cbelieves that people flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex.\u201d It says she views her career \u201cas an outgrowth of her faith\u201d and that many clients come to her because of her Christianity.\u00a0\n\nA ruling against the state would open the possibility to challenging other licensing and malpractice processes, Weiser said. The brief the state filed says, \u201cFrom this country\u2019s infancy, states have exercised their power to regulate professional healthcare treatment to protect patients from substandard care,\u201d and that has always included treatments performed with words like therapy.\n\n\u201cWhat is at stake is whether or not the Supreme Court opens up a First Amendment exemption to professional licensing and malpractice systems that are designed to prevent patients from suffering substandard care, and that is the core argument we make in our brief,\u201d Weiser said. \u201cThe Supreme Court has never created such an exemption before. They shouldn\u2019t do so now.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the court declined to review a similar challenge in 2023. While the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the Colorado law, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has struck down local bans on conversion therapy in Florida.\u00a0\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\n\nSUPPORT\nREPUBLISH\n\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The renowned competitor visited Laughlin Air Force Base on Aug. 18th, 2021 to discuss mental health resilience and the importance of self-care.\n\nMr. Walker uses his own mental health journey to eliminate the stigma attached to asking for help when necessary before it is too late. Mental health issues\u00a0 have plagued a number of those who served in the armed forces. According to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, 6,435 veterans took their own lives in 2018.\n\nWhile there are many triggers which contribute to these terrible tragedies, emotional distress is the most prominent. Causes of this may vary whether from stressful situations at home, workplace, or in combat zones. These situations can include what you do in the war, the politics around the war, where the war is fought, and the type of enemy you face. All of these factors may contribute to PTSD and other mental health problems.\n\nDuring his visit with Airman, Mr. Walker shared that he too suffered from Dissociative identity disorder He explained that once it started to affect his personal life, his support group pushed him to seek help so he could overcome this new challenge.\n\n\u201cI started going to some professionals to help me cope with different things and the way they did that was to give me different things to do whether it was talking to someone, journaling, or doing pottery. That is where I started coping with things,\u201d said Walker.\n\nThroughout his tour, he met Airmen from all different walks of life and backgrounds, and shared the same advice and wisdom to each of them.\n\n\u201cYou have to think about more than just yourself,\u2019 said Walker, \u2018There's someone that loves you whether it's your family or friends, and it's important to know there are people that can make you feel better.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s important to raise awareness of these issues and to do what we can to insure those who need help can get the support they need. Seeking help is key whether it be from friends, family or professionals.\u00a0\n\nResources for our service members include the mental health clinic, military family life counselors at Airman Family Readiness Center, and the chaplain. Additionally, veterans can contact Veterans Affairs at 1(800) 698-2411.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is admitting the truth to yourself that there's a problem that exists,\u201d Herschel Walker imparted. \u201cWe try to hide our problems because we\u2019re ashamed of them and try to pretend it doesn't exist; once you admit it, you can finally work to try to overcome it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0", "source_domain": "www.aetc.af.mil", "article_id": "4870691c-a9f4-48f5-8ebf-4ee6f67032a7", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}

(Getty Images)\n\nThis story originally appeared in at Stateline.\n\nSome states and hospital systems have updated their policies on drug testing for pregnant women and newborns, aiming to better support patients\u2019 treatment and recovery from substance use disorder and combat racial disparities in testing and reporting.\n\nUnder federal law, medical professionals must notify child protective agencies when an infant has been affected by the mother\u2019s substance use, including alcohol use. However, the federal rules \u2014 which were updated in 2016 in response to the opioid epidemic \u2014 emphasize that substance use disorder on its own doesn\u2019t constitute child abuse, and require states to develop their own \u201cplans of safe care\u201d to promote the long-term health of the newborn and the mother.\n\nBut federal law doesn\u2019t define \u201caffected,\u201d and testing and reporting policies vary from state to state and even from hospital to hospital. As the opioid crisis continues, some of the nation\u2019s most prominent hospital systems and a handful of states have enacted or are considering less punitive approaches, as long as the baby is in no imminent danger.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nOne impetus for the shift is research showing that Black pregnant women are more likely to be drug tested and long-standing disparities in how Black and Indigenous families are treated by child welfare agencies. Mental health conditions and substance use have also emerged as leading causes of maternal death, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cThe data about bias in child welfare reporting related to pregnant/birthing people\u2019s substance use has been around for decades,\u201d Sarah Roberts, a legal epidemiologist and professor at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an email to Stateline. Roberts tracks testing policies across the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s changed, Roberts said, is a growing awareness of the harms of over-testing and over-reporting to child welfare agencies.\n\nOnly two states, Minnesota and North Dakota, have laws that require drug testing of pregnant patients in certain circumstances, such as when there are complications during birth that point to the possible use of drugs or alcohol, according to an analysis by If/When/How, a reproductive justice nonprofit. And only four states (Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin) mandate the drug testing of newborns in certain circumstances.\n\nThe data about bias in child welfare reporting related to pregnant/birthing people\u2019s substance use has been around for decades.\n\n\u2013 Sarah Roberts, a legal epidemiologist and professor at the University of California, San Francisco\n\nBut hospitals and clinicians are often confused about their own state laws, said Joelle Puccio, director of education at the Academy of Perinatal Harm Reduction, which provides information to pregnant women and parents who use drugs.\n\n\u201cWhat actually happens is always more punitive, more surveillance than what is actually required by the law, and it always falls more heavily on Indigenous, Black and other families of color,\u201d said Puccio, who has worked as a registered nurse in perinatal and neonatal intensive care for two decades.\n\nMass General Brigham in Boston, one of the most highly respected hospital systems in the country, announced changes to its perinatal reporting policy in April as part of a broader effort to eliminate practices that might \u201cunwittingly perpetuate structural racism.\u201d\n\nProvided the baby isn\u2019t in imminent danger, the hospital will now conduct toxicology testing only with written consent from the pregnant patient and will only report positive results to child welfare authorities if clinicians determine the baby is suffering or in imminent danger. Mass General Brigham also will move away from considering a baby\u2019s exposure to drugs or alcohol \u2014 including a mother\u2019s medication treatment for opioid use disorder \u2014 as automatic grounds for reporting abuse or neglect. This is to combat the stigma pregnant patients often report facing while on such medication treatment, leading them to fear health care settings.\n\n\u201cThe single biggest deterrent for people engaging in care was the concern that if they went on buprenorphine or methadone, lifesaving treatment for their opioid use disorder, that they would have an open case with the Department of Children and Families,\u201d said Dr. Davida Schiff, director of perinatal and family-based substance use disorder care at Mass General Brigham. \u201cWe know that buprenorphine and methadone reduce the risk of overdose.\u201d\n\nDr. Allison Bryant Mantha, an OB-GYN and associate chief health equity officer at Mass General Brigham, said one priority of the policy change was to lessen room for bias.\n\n\u201cWhen you allow people to have a lot of their own discretion, that sometimes is where biases kind of creep in,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes minimizing variability gets you to equity.\u201d\n\nLegislation has been introduced in the Massachusetts Senate that aims to protect parents from scrutiny from child welfare authorities or criminal prosecution when their infant has been affected by in-utero substance exposure.\n\nOther states already have approved such policies. Since 2019, Connecticut has directed health care providers to shield the identity of the parents when reporting a positive test to child welfare authorities, and to instead offer supportive services. That year, New Mexico also passed a law that removes substance use disorder from being considered abuse or neglect on its own.\n\nAnd in 2020, Colorado updated its definition of child abuse and neglect to exclude cases in which a newborn tests positive for substance or alcohol exposure and the mother is on medication-assisted treatment.\n\nBut hospital staff still express confusion about state law, said Britt Westmoreland, a doula and addiction recovery specialist at the University of Colorado College of Nursing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had hospitals have policies that are more punitive than state law,\u201d Westmoreland said, \u201cand I have addressed that directly by educating them on what the state law is.\u201d\n\nStateline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

But compliance is proving difficult.\n\nBY STEPHEN SIMPSON\nMARCH 7, 2025\n5 AM CENTRAL\nSHARE\nREPUBLISH\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nA new state law meant to ensure that more Texans recovering from substance abuse in residential facilities have uniform standards of care and living conditions may not have the effect lawmakers intended.\n\nThe 2023 law, which goes into effect in September, requires recovery homes to be accredited to receive state funding. That accreditation requires them to meet specific health standards, adhere to an established code of ethics and agree to inspections. But there aren\u2019t enough people to inspect the nearly 600 recovery homes, the cost of becoming accredited can be cost prohibitive for some facilities and legislators haven\u2019t earmarked enough money to subsidize the number of homes advocates say are needed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough incentive for them to get accredited,\u201d said Ralph Fabrizio, a certified recovery support peer specialist and owner of the accredited House of Extra Measures facilities in Houston. \u201cThere is just not a lot of money in recovery housing, and this is another expense some good providers can\u2019t take on financially because they are already battling unlicensed recovery homes, setting the price point so low that it's running them out of business.\u201d\n\nHouse Bill 299, which the Texas Legislature passed in 2023, prohibits a recovery house from receiving state money if it has not participated in the \u201cvoluntary\u201d accreditation process.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nTexas Health and Human Services Commission adopted the standards established by the National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR) and the nonprofit Oxford House Incorporated. These accreditation organizations' standards require a community-based approach to recovery and set the bar for resident safety while educating providers on what is legally required in health care.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\u201cA lot of people come into recovery housing from other industries with not a full understanding of the rules in health care,\u201d said Elizabeth Henry, director of policy for RecoveryPeople, a substance use recovery nonprofit based in Texas. \u201cThings like referral fees and bonuses and things like that are not welcomed in health care, but we have people trying to get discounts on drug testing. One of the great things that happens when they go through accreditation is they learn these things.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Oxford House, Texas Recovery Oriented Housing Network accredits recovery houses in Texas. To start the certification process, a recovery house must pay $500 per application and $10 per bed.\n\nTo help categorize recovery residences into more specific groups, NARR distinguishes these residences based on four levels of care.\n\nThe first level is peer-run recovery residences, where residents operate the facility. Level two is for monitored recovery residences, with an administrative director overseeing operations. A level three home is a supervised recovery residence, which has more intense oversight than monitored residences and includes 24/7 support for residents. The fourth and final level is for service provider recovery residences, which are typically operated by organizations or corporations that offer clinical and administrative supervision and credentialed staff.\n\nA House of Extra Measures home in Houston on Feb. 27. \nCredit:\n Danielle Villasana for The Texas Tribune\n\nEach level has standards that must be met before being certified by NARR, including requirements for administrative operations, recovery support, physical environment, and even how to be a good neighbor. It also includes a rule that makes paid work agreements completely voluntary so residents don\u2019t suffer consequences for declining work, a costly concept for recovery home providers.\n\nTexas Recovery Oriented Housing Network is the only accreditation agency in the state that can certify all levels, as Oxford House Incorporated deals mainly with level 1 homes.\n\nWhile these standards are meant to improve residents' recovery, they saddle housing providers with additional costs. Providers make most of their money from residents\u2019 rent.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nHenry said House Bill 299 was initially meant to include funding, but lawmakers removed this portion during committee hearings. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said.\n\nResidents\u2019 private or public health insurance usually does not cover housing costs for recovery residences, leading to recovery homes closing or switching to more profitable care facilities..\n\n\u201cCurrently, the conundrum that we face is that the higher the severity of illness, the lower the resources the person has available. This is because the higher the severity, the higher the care they need, which is more expensive, and insurance doesn\u2019t pay for it,\u201d Henry said.\n\nThe exact number of recovery homes in Texas is unknown because accreditation is voluntary. Still, advocates believe 600 to 700 recovery homes are operating in a given year. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission reports that 407 are accredited or chartered homes, with 326 of those being low-intensity resident-run homes.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nHenry estimates around 300 homes lack accreditation and risk being cut off from all state funding.\n\nThe Texas Health and Human Services Commission could not provide an exact number of recovery homes that lack accreditation because no agency gathers information on every recovery home that exists.\n\nTo meet the current demand from Texans seeking to recover from substance abuse, the state needs at least 300 more dwellings and 200 more high-intensity managed care homes to be accredited, said Jason Pullin, the director of the Texas Recovery Oriented Housing Network.\n\nAccording to the National Study of Treatment and Addiction Recovery Residences, the state currently ranks 33rd in the nation for recovery homes per capita. Most Texas counties \u2014 218 \u2014 have no identified recovery housing, and 86% have fewer than five.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe Texas Recovery Oriented Housing Network has accredited 81 recovery homes, with 23 residences becoming newly certified through the voluntary process in fiscal year 2024. Even if the demand for accreditation increases, the Texas affiliate of the national accreditation organization will likely not meet it due to a lack of staff.\n\n\u201cWe currently have one paid employee, myself, but we operate from El Paso to Beaumont, Amarillo to South Texas. These homes must be physically walked through as part of the accreditation process. We just don\u2019t have the bandwidth,\u201d said Pullin, the organization\u2019s director.\n\nDecorations at a House of Extra Measures home in Houston. \nCredit:\n Danielle Villasana for The Texas Tribune\n\nTexas Health and Human Services Commission identified the single issue concerning accreditation is providers don\u2019t find it financially feasible or worthwhile.\n\nThe exact amount of money a recovery home receives from the state can vary depending on the level of substance use it is meant to address, as higher-intensity programs might need medicine programs and clinical support.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nState funds usually cover rent for specific residents in a recovery home, ranging from $300 to $2,000 monthly. However, this is not a reliable source of funding for most providers.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of recovery homes in Texas do not receive state funding,\u201d Henry said. \u201cCurrently, approximately 15 homes under PROJECT HOMES and those supported by BeWell Texas receive state funds, and both programs require NARR accreditation. However, BeWell Texas only covers costs of residents who meet specific criteria, making the funding highly limited and inconsistent.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission spent $10 million on substance-use housing, with $4 million going to the Texas Targeted Opioid Response recovery housing program.\n\nThe majority of state funding for recovery housing goes to Oxford House, which has had a decade-long contract with the Texas health agency, with the current one being $1.6 million annually. Oxford House has accredited 326 homes, with 20 residences newly chartered in 2024.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cWhile this funding has provided stable support for Oxford Houses, it has also contributed to a significant gap in recovery housing options, as other recovery homes remain largely unfunded,\u201d Henry said.\n\nAdditionally, some recovery homes occasionally receive housing vouchers from local mental health authorities, but these payments can take months to process, making them impractical options for many homes and residents.\n\nFrom left: Mindy Anderson and Charlotte Loving, house managers of House of Extra Measures homes, work in the office on Feb. 27.

Become one.\n\n\u201cIn my estimate as a former operator, the average budget for a recovery home would range from $50,000 on the low end to over $100,000 on the upper end,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery provider has a unique program. There is no way to get an accurate average with a multitude of differences among providers.\u201d\n\nThe current situation in Texas has led many recovery homes to look for other funding sources, either by leaving the industry altogether or switching to programs that have more consistent federal and state funding.\n\nThis is why recovery housing advocates and managers have asked lawmakers to send $4.3 million to level two or three accredited homes during the next two-year state budget cycle. Most level one homes already receive consistent funding, and a clinic or hospital usually supports level-four dwellings, so they don\u2019t need additional funding, Henry said.\n\nThe recovery home industry warned lawmakers in a hearing that without rental assistance, facilities with expensive programs will continue to close or move to more profitable outpatient programs, and more dangerous, unregulated facilities will replace them.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that this funding proposal will successfully move through the appropriations process and become part of the state budget, expanding access to quality recovery housing for more Texans in need,\u201d Henry said.\n\nWhat is a recovery home?\n\nLyndsi Taylor, a 35-year-old Pearland resident, began a downward spiral into drug abuse seven years ago when her youngest daughter died. She\u2019s bounced around from couches to rehab programs to the streets, but this year, she is ready for a change.\n\nLyndsi Taylor, 35, works on writing at a House of Extra Measures home. \"I'm working really hard to do it this time and I'm scared to death but everybody keeps telling me it's a healthy fear. Because I don't want to go back. I don't want to and I just pray that I never do,\" Taylor said about her recovery. \nCredit:\n Danielle Villasana for The Texas Tribune\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full-time job just worrying about how you\u2019re going to get pills. And it\u2019s so exhausting, and I\u2019m just so tired of that; I\u2019m so tired of that same old worrying about something that doesn\u2019t even do anything for me and causes nothing but trouble in my life,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nFor people like Taylor, a recovery home is a community of like-minded individuals who are there to pick you up at your lowest moments.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cThe girls are great. There\u2019s a sisterhood and a bond because we\u2019re all going through the same thing,\u201d Taylor, who is currently staying in a recovery home in Houston, said. \u201cWe hold each other accountable. But we\u2019re there for each other when you need it, too. You need that community because you can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\n\nFor many Texans, leaving rehab is just the start of the recovery journey, not the end.\n\n\u201cYou are pretty much going from the street to 30 days in treatment and then right back home,\u201d said Sarah Saidock, who was a resident of a recovery home in 2021. \u201cThose addictive behaviors are still going to be engraved in you.\u201d\n\nSaidock said her time at a recovery home allowed her to regulate her emotions again after years of numbing them with drugs.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been sent to that recovery home, I wouldn\u2019t have had that time to heal and grow and be a responsible parent for my daughter that I still am today; that made a world of difference for me,\u201d said Saidock, who has worked at House of Extra Measures, a recovery housing program in Houston since her treatment.\n\nRecovery housing benefits individuals by reinforcing a substance-free lifestyle and providing direct connections via support groups, participating in house meetings, peer support, job training, and more.\n\nRecovery house resident Kimberly Ham, 39, reads during a meeting on March 2. \nCredit:\n Danielle Villasana for The Texas Tribune\n\n\u201cYou must learn many little things, like keeping the house clean and pushing in your chair. At first, I thought that was stupid, and then I started to like taking care of the house, taking care of myself, and being respectful,\u201d said Kimberly Ham, who has been a Hoskins House for Women resident in Houston for the past three months.\n\nHowever, for many who are searching for help with their addiction, finding a quality recovery home can be a challenging task.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to awful places. I mean roach infestations, people still doing drugs all the time and stealing,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThere are a lot of places like that, but this place is completely different.\u201d\n\nWhy is accreditation important?\n\nStudies show that recovery homes with enforced standards are a key step in recovery and preventing relapses. Still, the quality can vary from place to place since the accreditation process is voluntary in Texas.\n\n\u201cAnybody can open up a recovery home, put some beds in it, put utilities on it, market it, and put some bodies in there,\u201d said Fabrizio.\n\nThis has led to a problem where tracking what recovery home is open or closed can be challenging.\n\n\u201cSince undergoing accreditation is a voluntary process, HHSC cannot confirm the total number of operating recovery homes in Texas,\u201d said James Rivera, spokesperson for the state health agency.\n\nStates cannot simply close down unlicensed houses because doing so would violate the Federal Fair Housing Act and Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n\u201cOther recovery homes will say they will give you grace but want their money immediately. They want their money, and it\u2019s almost impossible to focus on recovery when stressed about finding a job just to get a bed,\u201d said Stephanie Paris, who had been abusing opioids and heroin since the age of 11.\n\nParis, 46, decided she was ready for a change after being released from rehab in early 2024. However, she knew the grim options that awaited someone with her financial means.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible, especially in today\u2019s economy, to start from scratch all over again without some kind of support and assistance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are pretty much homeless once you leave a rehab program.\u201d\n\nA framed affirmation at a House of Extra Measures home. \nCredit:\n Danielle Villasana for The Texas Tribune\n\nWhen Paris thought she had no other options and would have to continue her court mandated probation on her own, she learned about the House of Extra Measures. This accredited recovery housing organization offered services to people with little to no income.\n\n\u201cIt was a game changer. It allowed me to make my recovery the most important thing in my life, and that set a routine and foundation for me. All of this can be hard to do when you have to worry about paying rent or end up back on the street,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nRecovery housing advocates say more money from the state will save taxpayer dollars.\n\n\u201cWe are currently spending a bunch of money on people with some pieces of addiction. We\u2019re spending on the justice system. We are spending it on child removals and spending it on human trafficking prevention. It touches every area that we taxpayers pay for,\u201d said Cynthia Humphrey, executive director of the Texas Association of Substance Abuse Programs.\n\nAdvocates want $2 million of the $4.3 million requested from the state to be used on implementing and administering accreditation programs.\n\n\u201cAdditional funds would allow us to increase staff and our ability to develop more training materials for providers who want to get into operating a recovery home,\u201d Pullin said. \u201cThere is not a lack of interest in this purpose. It\u2019s a lack of resources.\u201d\n\nAdvocates also propose using some of these funds to create rental assistance programs for accredited providers, easing some of the financial burden created by trying to provide quality service.\n\n\u201cMy husband is one of the do-gooders who started a recovery home in the early 2000s, and it lasted about two years after pouring so much money into the home,\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cWe need to do something for our providers and those seeking help.\u201d\n\nDanielle Villasana contributed to this story.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to welcome you to the 15th annual Texas Tribune Festival, Texas\u2019 breakout ideas and politics event happening Nov. 13\u201315 in downtown Austin.

Photo: John Frank/Axios\n\nFebruary is stout month \u2014 a celebration of the inkiest, richest beers that fit like a sweater for the colder weather.\n\nBe smart: Not all stouts are the same. In fact, you can find at least a dozen variations in Colorado from the dry Irish stouts popular on St. Patrick's Day to the newfangled syrupy pastry brews. Often the styles will blend together, too.\n\nHere's a guide on what to look for:\n\nMilk stout\n\nThe style of Colorado's most famous stout, Left Hand's Milk Stout. This style is unique for its addition of lactose, the sugar in dairy. It adds a silky, smooth texture that softens the roasted malt characteristics.\n\nTaste: Copper Kettle Milk Stout and 4 Noses El Jefe series\nCoffee stout\n\nThe dark malts that give stout its color lend a coffee note, so why not double down. Most coffee stouts involve resting the beer on coffee beans to extract flavor, though some add cold brew to the beer, which can provide a small jolt of caffeine.\n\nTaste: Cerebral Forever Awake Nola Style, Peculiar Straight Up and Avery Tweak\nPastry stout\n\nThis is the modern Wild West of stouts. Often known as adjunct, this style is typically known for its dessert qualities with the addition of cinnamon, coconut, vanilla or cacao nibs. But it can also include peppers, almonds, fruit and more.\n\nTaste: WeldWerks Pastry Stout, Cerveceria Churro Stout, Wiley Roots Breakfast at Wiley's series and Verboten Not a Speck of Light\nOatmeal stout\n\nTo get that creamy mouthfeel without dairy, turn to the oatmeal stout. The addition of oats also makes for a lighter sip and nicely sweet character, the kind of stout that allows you to drink more than one.\n\nTaste: Cerebral Dark Galaxie, Dry Dock Boatmeal Stout and Upslope Oatmeal Stout\nNitro stout\n\nThe addition of tiny nitrogen bubbles revs up the velvety texture of the beer and pours like a Cirque du Soleil show in the glass. This is the style's luxury model.\n\nTaste: Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro and Breckenridge Nitro Irish Stout\nRussian Imperial stout\n\nNamed for its reported popularity with the Russian Imperial Court in the 1700s, this version features higher alcohol and intense flavors. Roasted malts with coffee and chocolate notes are the most common flavors.\n\nTaste: Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, Great Divide Big Yeti and Trve Funeral\nBarrel-aged stout\n\nResting a stout of any variety in a barrel adds nuanced flavors of oak, leather and spice. Often the barrels once held spirits or wine and how it develops is \"a combination of strategy and luck,\" says Cerebral owner Sean Buchan.\n\nThe older the barrels, the more mellow the impact; the younger, the boozier the influence on the beer.\nTaste: Ratio's BA Genius Wizard, Epic Big Bad Baptist series, Copper Kettle's Snowed In series, Casey's BA Wrong Answers Only, Odell Barreled Treasure and Station 26 Eternal Descent\nBonus\n\nOne Colorado beer represents a flavor all to itself: Wynkoop's Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout. The base is a foreign style with the addition of 25 pounds of roasted bull's testicles (the aforementioned \"oysters\"). It provides a touch of umami to the beer but finishes dry. The latest version is aged in oak.\n\nfacebook (opens in new window)\ntwitter (opens in new window)\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\nnextdoor (opens in new window)\nemail (opens in new window)\nMore Denver stories\n\nGet a free daily digest of the most important news in your backyard with Axios Denver.\n\nSubscribe\n\ud83c\udf31\n\nSupport local journalism by becoming a member.\n\nLearn more", "source_domain": "www.axios.com", "article_id": "e10c5df3-dcd4-4d0e-bc24-ceda7ab8c7f9", "scraped_at": "2025-08-20T17:50:51.855893"}
