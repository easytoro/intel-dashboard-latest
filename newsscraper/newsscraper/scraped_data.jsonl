Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake, one of the main authors of the study. “About the only thing that’s worth a lot is our livestock. It’s not improving.”\n\nDent is a rancher and farmer himself, raising buffalo, hay and grass.\n\nEconomics are usually in the top three stressors for farmers and farmworkers surveyed, McMoran said.\n\nWSU Extension offers various mental health first aid courses, McMoran said. The Pizza for Producers program is seeking event hosts and corporate sponsors for the fall and winter.\n\n“The biggest thing is normalizing farm stress and talking about suicides, so we can educate folks on signs to look for,” he said. “It’s really those neighbors and folks who are coming to your farm every day, that are going to step in to really combat the issue.”\n\nEconomic strain\n\nEconomic strain further exacerbates mental health risks among agricultural producers and farm workers, Johnson said:\n\nStructural and regulator pressures contribute to increased stress.\n\nThe growing reliance on loans and the associated pressure to repay them during periods of market volatility intensifies financial and psychological stress for agricultural producers.\n\nLabor shortages and the increased cost of living are causing farm owners and farm workers to experience struggles to meet basic needs due to rising housing, food and transportation costs.\n\nChanging weather patterns can significantly impact yield and market stability of agricultural commodities.\n\n“Improving access to confidential, culturally responsive and agriculture-informed mental health support is essential, particularly in rural areas,” Johnson said. “Mental health professionals and telehealth responders must possess a foundational understanding of the unique stressors associated with working in rural and agricultural environments.”\n\nCOVID-19 impacts\n\nThe report cites Western Regional Stress Assistance Program baseline survey data, which lists the COVID-19 pandemic as a top stressor for farmers and ranchers.\n\n“COVID-19 introduced new stressors to already challenging working conditions, further increasing the risk of mental health crises and suicide,” Johnson said.\n\nCompounding impacts include:\n\nIncreased costs of essential needs (fertilizer, fuel, seeds, feed) remain high due to the disruptions in global supply chains that began during the pandemic.\n\nMany community-based support structures paused or dissolved due to increased isolation and reduced access to support systems, including Grange meetings, cooperative extension events, fairs, community centers and faith-based gatherings.\n\n“COVID exposed the gaps in rural healthcare systems, and many clinics still haven’t fully recovered or reopened,” Johnson said.\n\nMany workers left the industry permanently during the pandemic due to safety concerns, illness or better-paying jobs in other sectors.\n\n“Farmers themselves aged during the pandemic, and many nearing retirement age now face even fewer successors, worsening the mental strain of succession planning,” Johnson said.\n\nEliminating stressors\n\nDent got the idea for the report because of the national 988 suicide and crisis hotline. Dent weighed a separate hotline for rural and agricultural residents.\n\n“Our folks in the agriculture world are different, they live in a different culture, they’re just different folks, they’re more self-reliant, resilient to a lot of things … To call 988, our rural folks probably aren’t going to do that,” he said.\n\nThe study was meant to examine the stressors involved, Dent said.\n\n“We needed to look at the whole picture,” he said. “What is taking a farmer or rancher from working hard, doing what they like, to wanting to end their life?”\n\nHaving a national and state hotline is important, Dent said, but he wants to start eliminating the stressors that are possible to eliminate.\n\n“You can’t change the price of the inputs, or what we’re going to get for the crop,” he said. “But we can go look at the other stressors that are out there.”\n\nDent pointed to the regulatory environment that farmers and ranchers live under in the U.S. and the state as a major stressor, including agriculture overtime expenses.\n\n“That’s the sort of thing that we can make a difference,” he said.\n\nDent will consult with his fellow state lawmakers to “see what we can do as far as making legislation together to change some of the load that we put on our folks.”\n\nThe support of elected officials is important, McMoran said. Farm stress suicide prevention is a priority of the Trump administration and has good advocates among state legislators, he said.\n\nMessage to farmers\n\n“Pay attention to your neighbors and friends,” Dent said. “If you see a change in their attitude, in their personality, their moods, ask questions. ‘Are you OK? Everything going OK? What can I do to help you? What’s happening on the farm and ranch?’ All of us could do that.”\n\nAnd for farmers who are feeling the strain themselves?\n\n“If you do feel like you’re carrying too big a load, talk to your friends,” Dent said.\n\nPROGRAMS FOR ASSISTANCE\n\nSuicide Prevention: https://extension.wsu.edu/skagit/suicide-prevention/\n\nWestern Regional Agricultural Stress Assistance Program: https://farmstress.us/\n\nWSU free therapy voucher program: https://extension.wsu.edu/skagit/free-therapy-voucher-program/\n\nPizza for Producers: https://pizza4producers.com/", "source_domain": "capitalpress.com"}

More routes are being studied, with at least five in the planning stages. “We are just getting warmed up,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at the 2024 U.S. High Speed Rail Conference in May.\n\n“There [have] been maps floating around for years, if not decades, depicting a nationwide high-speed rail network,” said Ezra Silk, political director at the U.S. High Speed Rail Coalition, a group of industry and labor advocates. Silk sees the U.S. hitting a “tipping point” as soon as the first of these new projects begins operating. “We need to have a real pipeline of projects around the country if we're going to be moving towards the national system in time to deal with climate change,” he said.\n\nThe coalition today released a 20-page guide for high-speed rail advocates on how to get started on organizing, building community and political support and finding initial and long-term funding. “We’re really trying to get this into the hands of local leaders who care about their regions and understand that this could be perhaps one of the most transformative things that's happened since the interstate highway system,” Silk said.\n\nThe document lists five stages of the high-speed rail life cycle: project initiation, project development, final design, construction and operations. “It starts with recognizing that this is going to be a complicated undertaking that's going to require a multifaceted effort to get going,” said Bernard Cohen, principal author of the guide and senior advisor for planning and operations at Alternate Concepts, a Boston-based transit service provider.\n\nThe guide lays out the beginning steps of an HSR project. First, Cohen said, “You need to start thinking about building toward a mature organization. Secondly, you need to start engaging with organizations and people who might be interested in supporting a high-speed rail project, and you need to work with them to begin to build those relationships. The third thing is you need to start some technical planning.”\n\nThe initial steps include lining up potential supporters, conducting a preliminary feasibility study, identifying risks and obstacles and developing a political outreach strategy. “The optimism, which is really important at this stage, needs to be tempered with a realistic sense of what the risks are,” Cohen said, “because projects like high-speed rail are going to have really strong supporters and are going to inevitably invoke some opposition.”\n\nEven at an early stage, funding will be needed for planning and marketing materials. Cohen suggested asking for money from the businesses in the area the new HSR line would serve, as it could bring them a broader sphere of potential employees. Advocates should also explore local and federal funding options and consider approaching labor unions who may benefit from job creation, he said.\n\nThe road map encourages advocates to build a diverse group of supporters with varying skills. Cohen named expertise in communications, community engagement and technical planning as key additions to the team. But the most important skill set for a leader, he said, is the “ability to define and articulate the vision for what high-speed rail could do for their region … That person needs to have credibility [and] needs to have good contacts with important players in the region.”\n\nCohen said he believes the road map “can be helpful in sidestepping some of the challenges that create a more protracted process.”\n\nBut Silk warned that launching a campaign for what will be a multi-billion-dollar project “is not for the faint-hearted.” He said, “These are some of the biggest and most complicated infrastructure projects in the world, and delivering them in the U.S. is challenging.”\n\nMore than 3 billion passengers ride high-speed trains around the world each year, but just over 12 million ride the United States' only high-speed rail line in Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor, where Acela trains reach speeds of 150 mph. The U.S. has fewer miles of high-speed rail than 10 other countries, according to the International Union of Railways.\n\n“We’re really going to need a series of campaigns in all the major regions of the country, coming from ground up, pushing for these high-speed rail corridors,” Silk said. “Now's the time to strike.”", "source_domain": "www.smartcitiesdive.com"}
{"url": "https://www.wonkette.com/p/dr-oz-is-out-here-lying-about-lazy", "title": "Dr. Oz Is Out Here Lying About 'Lazy' Medicaid Recipients Again", "published_at": null, "full_text": "For a decade now, politicians and pundits from the Right to the center-Left have desperately, fiercely, like their lives depended on it (the exact opposite of most of us) tried to dissuade Americans from wanting Medicare for All. Republicans have insisted that it would lead to higher taxes, communism, and people never being able to see a doctor, while centrist Democrats have pleaded for some kind of plan that would provide health insurance to those that need it without, godforbid, eliminating the precious, precious, private health insurance companies that we all know and love so dearly, even though one of the big ways such a program would save money would be by eliminating the administration costs involved in negotiating coverage and billing different providers.\n\nAnd yet … according to a poll from this past July, 60 percent of Americans still want it. Only 27 percent are opposed. That’s kind of wild when you think about it, especially considering that the poll wasn’t even an outlier. A recent Gallup poll found that 62 percent of Americans think the federal government should ensure that everyone has healthcare. It’s almost as if, no matter how much fear mongering is done, people can still just look at every other wealthy nation on earth and see that we’ve got a raw deal.\n\nOne person who really did not get the memo on this? The very person in charge of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, television’s Dr. Mehmet Oz. In an interview with CNBC yesterday, Dr. Oz once again laid into Medicaid recipients, accusing them of being a bunch of lazy, good-for-nothing jerks who just want to watch TV all day.\n\n“An able-bodied person on Medicaid today watches about 6.1 hours of television or just hangs out, leisure time,” he said in an interview on CNBC Thursday. “That’s a lot of time.” Is it, though?\n\nThat 6.1 hours figure comes from an American Enterprise Institute study, which found that this was the amount of time that Medicaid recipients who did not work spent “on all socializing, relaxing and leisure activities (including television and video games)” — so no, not just television. There are 24 hours in a day — math! — so 6.1 hours spent not working, for a person who is currently out of work, seems entirely reasonable. The average American spends around 5.3 hours a day on leisure time, according to one study. What is it, precisely, that he wants these people to do?\n\nIf there were enough available jobs out there for all 7.2 million unemployed people in the United States to spend 12 hours a day (allowing 8 for sleep), every day, applying to those jobs they were qualified for, that would probably be a bad sign.\n\nOf course, there may be more jobs available soon, of the lettuce- and tomato-picking variety. Sure, they might not even be in the same state, but at least people wouldn’t be watching daytime television, like … “Dr. Oz.”\n\n“It is reprehensible to criticize the president on this, I think, very earnest effort to save Medicaid,” Oz told CNBC host Joe Kernen, “to provide care to our most vulnerable.”\n\nAw! He’s earnest! He’s trying his best! His bill will only cause 16 million people to lose their healthcare, while also leading to around 300 rural hospitals across the United States shutting down due to lack of funds! Is that bad?\n\nVia Daily Beast:\n\nOz told CNBC host Joe Kernen that people should not use Medicaid in ways “it was not designed.” When Medicaid was created, he added Thursday, it was reserved for those in the “dawn” and “twilight” of their lives—childhood and old age—and for people “living in the shadows.” In other words, people with disabilities. “Those are the folks it was designed for,” he said. “So every Democratic president, and every Republican president, has said that the backbone of a social support fabric has to be work. You want people to actually get out of their homes and go do things.”\n\nFor what it’s worth, I can tell you that I never watched more TV in my life than when I was on unemployment. Was it because I was malicious and lazy and wanted to get away with not working? No, it was because I couldn’t afford to do anything else and was also stuck waiting to hear back from places where I’d applied.\n\nBut let’s take a minute and talk about those able-bodied adults, shall we? So-called “able-bodied adults” (many of whom have other disabilities) account for eight percent of all of those on Medicare — and most of them are not, as Oz has previously suggested, perfectly healthy 30-year-old men who live in their mothers’ basements and play video games all day (though if it were, how the hell much does Oz think someone like that would even cost us to cover?).\n\nRather, one analysis found that:\n\nWithin this small slice of nonworking adults who can be considered able-bodied, four in five (79.2%) are women, with an average age of 41. One in four (26%) is over age 50. Their median income is zero. They live in families with annual incomes averaging under $45,000 and an average household size of 4.4. In other words, they are exceptionally poor women on the older end of the working-age spectrum, who have no income of their own and live in poor families.\n\nThis group includes many former workers. Over half (56.2%) worked within the past five years, but eight in ten (81.9%) are no longer in the labor force.\n\nMost have less than a high school education and have left the workforce to take care of family members, such as elderly parents or adult children or spouses with disabilities or a combination of the three.\n\nA little bit different, no?\n\nThe thing is, though — even if Oz’s slanders on Medicaid recipients were true, which they are not, this whole thing of “Oh! Bad lazy people with no actual health problems are getting Medicaid and it’s just wrong!” is not going to fly when most people have come around to the idea that everyone should have health care.\n\nDonate Just Once!\n\nThere is no actual reason why Medicaid (or Medicare) would only be “designed” for those Oz says it’s designed for. Part of the reason Medicaid and Medicare cost so much is that those who are on them are also those with the most health problems. If we were to expand those programs to “everybody,” it would cost us all a hell of a lot less than the combination public and private health care system is costing us now.\n\nOf course, we are talking about a person who became rich and famous for dispensing dubious health advice on television, a practice that would probably be a little less profitable if people were able to get actual health care and advice from someone who isn’t a total scumbag.\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON WONKETTE!", "source_domain": "www.wonkette.com"}

Charged with mitigating fraud and abuse, protecting consumers, and ensuring digital health practices align with proper standards of care, the government has enhanced its oversight of healthtech companies since the COVID-19 pandemic. Most recently, substantial attention has been focused on the prescribing practices and potential engagement in unfair and deceptive acts by the once prominent mental health unicorn, Cerebral. Facing triple investigations by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Cerebral has become a cautionary tale for healthtech companies looking to provide telemedicine services across the U.S. This article explores the regulatory investigations of Cerebral and identifies key lessons and risk mitigation strategies for healthtech companies nationwide.\n\nThe Cerebral Investigations — Digital Health Gone Wrong\n\nFounded in 2019, Cerebral operates on a promise to democratize high-quality mental health care using digital health technology.1 To enhance access and affordability of mental health services, Cerebral connects patients with licensed clinicians who can provide behavioral health resources and prescriptions for depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder, and more. Using an on-demand subscription telehealth platform, Cerebral was perceived as revolutionizing access to mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic while breaking down the stigmas and taboos associated with behavioral health illnesses. Cerebral partnered with national icons, including U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, and spent millions of dollars each month on online advertisements.2 In the two years following the launch of its services, Cerebral obtained a $4.8 billion valuation and solidified crucial partnerships with health insurers.3\n\nFrom the outside, Cerebral appeared as a golden child set to disrupt the relatively inaccessible mental health industry. However, Cerebral’s foundation had begun to crack in ways that threatened to undermine not only the company’s viability but also patient safety. In March 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cerebral’s nurse practitioners complained of sustained pressure to unnecessarily prescribe Adderall and other ADHD medications regardless of medical necessity.3 In particular, clinicians voiced concern with renewing medications without appropriate follow-up and in-person visits.2 Cerebral’s former vice president of product and engineering, Matthew Truebe, subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company in April 2022, claiming that Cerebral put profits before patient safety and overprescribed ADHD medications.4 Truebe alleged that Cerebral planned to increase customer retention through the prescription of stimulants and controlled substances to its entire ADHD patient population.4\n\nCatching wind of Cerebral’s prescribing practices, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York issued a grand jury subpoena in May 2022, allowing the DOJ to investigate Cerebral for potential violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ’s investigation analyzes whether Cerebral’s clinicians can acquire sufficient medical information and perform adequate medical examinations in half-hour telehealth appointments to support not only the diagnosis of a mental health condition but also the medical necessity of a controlled substance prescription. Prescribing controlled substances absent medical necessity could result in claims for fraudulent billing under the False Claims Act and jeopardize patient well-being. Sources have also claimed that the DEA is investigating Cerebral and Truepill — Cerebral’s preferred online pharmacy — regarding patients’ obtainment of controlled substances, particularly when such patients have established multiple accounts to obtain the drugs.5 By the end of May 2022, CVS Health and Walmart had stopped filling controlled substance prescriptions from Cerebral, and multiple health insurers — including Aetna and United Health — had removed Cerebral from their networks.6\n\nA month later, the FTC initiated a separate investigation to determine whether Cerebral’s advertising and marketing practices constituted unfair or deceptive acts or practices.7 In particular, the FTC has raised concerns about whether Cerebral continued to bill customers after they had cancelled their subscriptions. Consumers have also publicly complained that Cerebral’s subscription cancellation process is burdensome and ineffective, with many patients never receiving promised refunds.8\n\nWhile Cerebral’s regulatory investigations are ongoing, the negative publicity and business impacts from the investigations are undeniable. In light of the DOJ’s investigation, Cerebral stopped prescribing controlled substances to new patients.6 In June and October 2022, Cerebral announced substantial layoffs as part of an operational restructuring effort. The layoffs in October involved more than 20% of Cerebral’s workforce.9 The bad news continued following the death of Elijah Hanson in December 2022, in which it was discovered that the 21-year-old had obtained ADHD medication from Cerebral — despite never having been previously diagnosed with the condition.10 Hanson’s brother alleged he obtained the drug to abuse it, reinforcing patient safety concerns with Cerebral’s prescribing practices.10\n\nCerebral is not the only healthtech company facing regulatory scrutiny over its business practices. Mental health startup Done Global is similarly under investigation by the DEA for its controlled substance prescribing practices.11 Comparable to Cerebral, Done is a membership-based platform that pairs patients seeking treatment for ADHD with licensed clinicians. Done received national attention in August 2022 following the death of Harlan Band, who had been prescribed Adderall by Done clinicians, despite his history of drug abuse.12 The DEA is investigating Done’s controlled substance prescribing practices, representing widening interest from the federal government in regulating healthtech companies.\n\nKey Takeaways From Cerebral For Healthtech Companies\n\nWith many healthtech companies employing similar business models as Cerebral — i.e., the exchange of money for on-demand access to clinicians and prescriptions — Cerebral’s woes may only be the beginning for the healthtech industry. The federal government is anticipated to step up its regulatory oversight of the digital health industry, with such investigations extending beyond mental health startups. Given the writing on the wall, it is important for healthtech companies to examine and understand regulatory pain points when it comes to digital health solutions and shore up their business practices before such investigations become widespread. Based on Cerebral, here are three important lessons that healthtech companies should know to minimize future regulatory risk.\n\n1. Tele-Prescribing Lessons\n\nThe DOJ and DEA investigations of Cerebral center heavily on improper prescribing practices for controlled substances. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a healthtech business model that integrated online prescribing of controlled substances would have been nearly impossible due to the prescribing laws in place. Specifically, the longstanding Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the delivery or dispensation of a controlled substance by means of the internet unless the clinician had first conducted an in-person exam.13 This had the effect of requiring healthcare practitioners to perform in-person medical evaluations prior to issuing prescriptions for controlled substances, except in limited circumstances. During the pandemic, the government temporarily lifted this restriction as part of the public health emergency (PHE), allowing providers to tele-prescribe controlled substances for patients they may never have met in person. Though the PHE currently remains in effect, the Ryan Haight Act’s limitations on tele-prescribing controlled substances are expected to resume once the PHE expires.\n\nIn light of this regulatory landscape, it is essential for healthtech companies that tele-prescribe controlled substances during the remainder of the PHE to ensure they are complying with applicable state tele-prescribing rules and that their clinicians have formed a proper patient-physician relationship prior to tele-prescribing. Almost all states require the formation of a patient-physician relationship as a prerequisite to tele-prescribing. Some states impose additional requirements, including conducting an appropriate medical evaluation that adheres to the same standard of care as an in-person visit and ensuring that the patient has access to appropriate follow-up care. Providers who are unable to determine medical necessity during a visit should schedule appropriate follow-up visits and tests (as necessary) to gather sufficient information to make a medically informed decision. Medical necessity should be adequately documented in the patient’s medical record and should reference supporting documentation and diagnoses. If telehealth is not an appropriate avenue for treatment of a particular patient, the healthtech company should refer the patient to in-person care. It is crucial to ensure that the use of digital health technology satisfies the medical standard of care for all patients.\n\nAdditionally, healthtech companies should avoid pressuring clinicians to prescribe certain amounts of medication or write a certain number of prescriptions. Clinicians must retain independent medical judgment to evaluate and treat patients on a case-by-case basis, without having their medical decision-making clouded by corporate finances. It is advisable for healthtech companies to develop policies and procedures that ensure medical decision-making remains separate from corporate greed. Such policies should require clinicians to use and document their medical judgment for each patient.\n\nFinally, healthtech companies should develop plans for business model changes that may result from the expiration of the PHE or the adoption of new regulatory rules based on current government investigations. When the PHE expires, the online controlled substance prescribing model may once again become obsolete. For companies that heavily rely on this capability, it is essential to begin thinking of long-term business strategies that can incorporate in-person visits as needed (assuming the PHE changes to the Ryan Haight Act are not made permanent prior to the PHE’s expiration). Further, the environment for tele-prescribing has shifted in response to the Cerebral investigations, with Walmart introducing a new policy in July 2022 that prohibits its pharmacies from accepting prescriptions for controlled substances issued through telehealth if there has not been an in-person patient visit within the past 24 months.14 While this is not a regulatory requirement, it is a risk mitigation strategy designed to help minimize the societal harms associated with overprescribing controlled substances. From a business standpoint, policies like these may force healthtech companies to find alternate pharmacies, which may be located outside the patient’s vicinity. Identifying and recognizing these types of trends early can help healthtech companies prepare for and quickly adapt their business models while minimizing the impact on revenue.\n\n2. Marketing and Advertising Lessons\n\nIn addition to the tele-prescribing lessons, there are key takeaways from the FTC’s investigation of Cerebral, which focuses less on tele-prescribing and more on standard business practices that are common to many healthtech business models.\n\nFirst, healthtech companies should reevaluate their marketing strategies given the regulatory climate. The FTC has been targeting companies that either misrepresent or exaggerate their businesses, particularly through online marketing and advertising campaigns. This includes not just content in a formal marketing campaign (e.g., social media advertisements) but also the language that healthtech companies use on their websites to describe their products and services. This language should be evaluated from two perspectives:\n\nIs the language misleading to an ordinary consumer of average intelligence? Does the language misrepresent the products or services in any manner — either overtly or through omission?\n\nAnnual website audits by the company’s product and legal teams can be particularly helpful in mitigating risk and can allow for early identification of problematic language prior to a regulatory investigation. When conducting a website audit, put yourself in the consumer’s shoes and analyze whether any language may be deceptive, ambiguous, or inflated.\n\nSecond, healthtech companies must develop easy processes and procedures for consumers to cancel their subscription plans and to ensure such cancellations are honored. The FTC has made clear its intent to ramp up enforcement actions against illegal dark patterns that trick consumers into purchasing (or prevent them from leaving) subscription services.15 Healthtech companies should develop and implement cancellation processes that are as easy to use as the original subscription methodology. For example, if a consumer could purchase a subscription online, an online subscription cancellation is recommended. By developing clear policies and procedures around subscription cancellations, healthtech companies can ensure that their workforces are appropriately trained to handle such cancellation requests. Moreover, healthtech companies should develop a method of documenting cancellation requests and follow-up actions.\n\n3. Compliance Lessons​\n\nFinally, from a compliance perspective, it is essential that healthtech companies encourage open lines of communication that encourage employees to report potential legal violations. Many federal investigations are the result of whistleblowers, who felt unheard by senior management when they attempted to voice concerns about the company’s business practices. Developing open lines of communication, including anonymous methods of reporting, can alert company leadership to non-compliance before it is reported to the federal government. For open lines of communication to work, the healthtech company must also develop and enforce a non-retaliation policy so that employees feel safe reporting suspected misconduct. Following up on complaints is highly recommended, as it shows employees that their concerns have been taken seriously.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Cerebral investigations represent the tip of the iceberg for federal scrutiny into the business practices of healthtech companies. The largely unregulated boom in healthtech driven by the COVID-19 pandemic is now drawing increased interest from regulators and lawmakers who are devoted to protecting patient safety. As the healthtech industry presents itself for inspection, there are many healthtech companies that have failed to comply with current laws, regulations, and best practices.

{"url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/high-speed-rail-united-states", "title": "High-Speed Rail Finally Coming to the U.S.", "published_at": "2024-05-16T13:11:50+00:00", "full_text": "In late April, the Miami-based rail company Brightline Trains broke ground on a project that the company promises will give the United States its first dedicated, high-speed passenger rail service. The 350-kilometer (218-mile) corridor, which the company calls Brightline West, will connect Las Vegas to the suburbs of Los Angeles. Brightline says it hopes to complete the project in time for the 2028 Summer Olympic Games, which will take place in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nBrightline has chosen Siemens American Pioneer 220 engines that will run at speeds averaging 165 kilometers per hour, with an advertised top speed of 320 km/h. That average speed still falls short of the Eurostar network connecting London, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam (300 km/h), Germany’s Intercity-Express 3 service (330 km/h), and the world’s fastest train service, China’s Beijing-to-Shanghai regional G trains (350 km/h).\n\nThere are currently only two rail lines in the U.S. that ever reach the 200 km/h mark, which is the unofficial minimum speed at which a train can be considered to be high-speed rail. Brightline, the company that is about to construct the L.A.-to-Las-Vegas Brightline West line, also operates a Miami-Orlando rail line that averages 111 km/h. The other is Amtrak’s Acela line between Boston and Washington, D.C.—and that line only qualifies as high-speed rail for just 80 km of its 735-km route. That’s a consequence of the rail status quo in the United States, in which slower freight trains typically have right of way on shared rail infrastructure.\n\nAs Vaclav Smil, professor emeritus at the University of Manitoba, noted in IEEE Spectrum in 2018, there has long been hope that the United States would catch up with Europe, China, and Japan, where high-speed regional rail travel has long been a regular fixture. “In a rational world, one that valued convenience, time, low energy intensity and low carbon conversions, the high-speed electric train would always be the first choice for [intercity travel],” Smil wrote at the time. And yet, in the United States, funding and regulatory approval for such projects have been in short supply.\n\nNow, Brightline West, as well as a few preexisting rail projects that are at some stage of development, such as the California High-Speed Rail Network and the Texas Central Line, could be a bellwether for an attitude shift that could—belatedly—put trains closer to equal footing with cars and planes for travelers in the continental United States.\n\nThe U.S. government, like many national governments, has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Because that generally requires decarbonizing transportation and improving energy efficiency, trains, which can run on electricity generated from fossil-fuel as well as non-fossil-fuel sources, are getting a big push. As Smil noted in 2018, trains use a fraction of a megajoule of energy per passenger-kilometer, while a lone driver in even one of the most efficient gasoline-powered cars will use orders of magnitude more energy per passenger-kilometer.\n\nBrightline and Siemens did not respond to inquiries by Spectrum seeking to find out what innovations they plan to introduce that would make the L.A.-to-Las Vegas passenger line run faster or perhaps use less energy than its Asian and European counterparts. But Karen E. Philbrick, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University, in California, says that’s beside the point. She notes that the United States, having focused on cars for the better part of the past century, already missed the period when major innovations were being made in high-speed rail. “What’s important about Brightline West and, say, the California High-speed Rail project, is not how innovative they are, but the fact that they’re happening at all. I am thrilled to see the U.S. catching up.”\n\nMaybe Brightline or other groups seeking to get Americans off the roadways and onto railways will be able to seize the moment and create high-speed rail lines connecting other intraregional population centers in the United States. With enough of those pieces in place, it might someday be possible to ride the rails from California to New York in a single day, in the same way train passengers in China can get from Beijing to Shanghai between breakfast and lunch.", "source_domain": "spectrum.ieee.org"}

The U.S. Department of Education is telling impacted districts that the Biden administration, in awarding the grants, violated \"the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.\" In a statement to NPR, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Department of Education, explained that \"recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions like recruiting quotas in ways that have nothing to do with mental health and could hurt the very students the grants are supposed to help .\" But the 2022 federal grant notice told schools explicitly: The services to be provided must be \"evidence-based.\"\n\nPurpose of the grants: The grants were part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — a bill passed in the aftermath of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which a teen gunman killed 19 elementary school students and two adults and injured 17 people. The endgame was \"to prepare and place 14,000 mental health professionals in schools,\" says Mary Wall, who oversaw K-12 policy and budget for the U.S. Department of Education during the Biden administration. 260 school districts in nearly every state received a portion of the $1 billion — in the form of five-year grants, which were paid out in installments.\n\nRead the full story\n\nThe Trump administration says it will stop paying out $1 billion in federal grants that school districts across the country have been using to hire mental health professionals, including counselors and social workers.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is telling impacted districts that the Biden administration, in awarding the grants, violated \"the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.\"\n\nThe grants were part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act — a bill passed in the aftermath of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which a teen gunman killed 19 elementary school students and two adults and injured 17 people. The bill, among other things, poured federal dollars into schools to address rising concerns about a student mental health crisis.\n\nThose dollars helped Superintendent Derek Fialkiewicz in Corbett, Ore., more than triple the number of school mental health professionals in his largely rural district of 1,100 students east of Portland. Before the grants, Fialkiewicz says his district had just two counselors, \"and we realized, that's just not sustainable for our students and especially coming out of COVID.\"\n\nIn early 2023, thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the district received a federal grant that fully covered the salaries and benefits of five new trained social workers.\n\n\"It's been amazing,\" says Fialkiewicz of the difference that federal money — and the social workers it paid for — have made in his school community.\n\nHe says he was shocked when he heard the Trump administration was putting an end to this federal support. Just Tuesday, a U.S. Department of Education employee who oversees their grant had given his district the go-ahead to add a telehealth texting service for students. An hour later, Fialkiewicz says, he got an email that the grant would be discontinued.\n\nRepublicans supported these mental health grants\n\nThe Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the mental health funding that accompanied it, enjoyed considerable Republican support even in the years after it passed.\n\n\"Too often, adolescents with untreated mental health conditions become the very same perpetrators who commit acts of violence,\" wrote three of the law's Republican supporters — Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — in a 2024 opinion piece. \"For this reason, we crafted our law to ensure teachers and administrators are equipped with the tools to recognize when a student is experiencing a mental health crisis and, more importantly, connect them with the care they need before it's too late.\"\n\nThe endgame was \"to prepare and place 14,000 mental health professionals in schools,\" says Mary Wall, who oversaw K-12 policy and budget for the U.S. Department of Education during the Biden administration.\n\nWall says about 260 school districts in nearly every state received a portion of the $1 billion — in the form of five-year grants, which were paid out in installments.\n\nNow, it appears those districts will have to find a way to do without the money they had planned for but will not receive.\n\n\"The preparation of new mental health professionals, as well as those who are already in service, is at risk,\" Wall says.\n\nIn Corbett, Fialkiewicz says he's been told his grant money, which was supposed to last until December of 2027, will instead stop this December, two years early. Once it does, he says, \"We're gonna end up going back to having two counselors in our district.\"\n\nThe superintendent says he feels \"disgusted\" by the idea of having to lay off those federally funded social workers.\n\n\"To be able to provide those [mental health] services and then have it ripped away for something that is completely out of our control, it's horrible,\" Fialkiewicz says. \"I feel for our students more than anything because they're not gonna get the services that they need.\"\n\nAn August 2024 poll from the American Psychiatric Association found that \"84% of Americans believe school staff play a crucial role in identifying signs of mental health issues in students.\"\n\nWhy the department says it cut the grants\n\nIn a statement to NPR, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Department of Education, explained the decision to discontinue the grants:\n\n\"Recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions like recruiting quotas in ways that have nothing to do with mental health and could hurt the very students the grants are supposed to help. We owe it to American families to ensure that tax-payer dollars are supporting evidence-based practices that are truly focused on improving students' mental health.\"\n\nBut the 2022 federal grant notice told schools explicitly: The services to be provided must be \"evidence-based.\"\n\nWall also disputes the department's characterization, telling NPR that \"the focus of these grants was absolutely on providing evidence-based mental health support to students. Any suggestion that this is a DEI program is a distraction from the real issue.\"\n\nThe Trump administration and the Education Department have been applying a new interpretation of federal civil rights law to a wide range of federal programs. Last month, the department threatened to revoke K-12 schools' federal funding if they don't stop all DEI programming and teaching that the department might consider discriminatory.\n\nIn response to a request from NPR to further explain why the department believes these mental health grants had somehow run afoul of Trump's anti-DEI policy, it offered a few brief excerpts from districts' grant applications, in which one grantee wrote that school counselors must be trained \"to recognize and challenge systemic injustices, antiracism, and the pervasiveness of white supremacy to ethically support diverse communities.\"\n\nThe initial federal request for grant applications suggested districts prioritize \"increasing the number of school-based mental health services providers in high-need [districts], increasing the number of services providers from diverse backgrounds or from the communities they serve, and ensuring that all services providers are trained in inclusive practices.\"\n\nIn the email Fialkiewicz received, notifying him of the grant's end, the department wrote that the efforts funded by the grant violate federal civil rights law, \"conflict with the Department's policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; undermine the well-being of the students these programs are intended to help; or constitute an inappropriate use of federal funds.\"\n\nWhen asked if diversity played any role in his district's grant application, Fialkiewicz replied:\n\n\"Yes, in our application, we did state, because it was part of the requirements, that we would use equitable hiring practices. And that's exactly what we did. And to me, equitable hiring practices means you hire the best person for the job. That's equitable.\"\n\nAnd now, those social workers he hired might lose their jobs.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR", "source_domain": "laist.com"}

{"url": "https://milanreports.com/2025/08/19/apa-statement-curva-sud-milano/", "title": "", "published_at": "2025-08-19T00:00:00", "full_text": "The situation between Milan and the Curva Sud has by now become a subject of contention and of great topical relevance in recent days. After witnessing a Milan–Bari match unfortunately deprived of the incessant warmth of the organized Rossoneri support, the first verdicts are already beginning to be hypothesized in the background. What will become of the Sud? Will Milan be willing to negotiate in an attempt to find solutions also with the Prosecutor’s Office? And above all: will the chants of the curva return to the stadium? As of today, the situation does not seem to bring immediate news, even if the APA (Association of Small Shareholders of AC Milan) has tried to draw concrete conclusions with a statement.\n\nHere's the APA statement:\n\n\"The recent events, judicial and disciplinary, that have concerned the management of Milan and the Ultras of the Curva Sud constitute a further reason for reflection for the Small Shareholders of the Club and for all Rossoneri supporters. All the more so after the season opener at San Siro and the “lunar” atmosphere that characterized the presence of 65,000 (fans?) who, in addition to 5,000 Bari supporters, filled the stadium. As is known, after the two first-degree convictions handed down to the leaders of the Curva, the club now does not intend to recognize any role for the Ultras in the organization of the support, starting with preventing them from the cumulative management of season tickets in their traditional sector of the stadium and prohibiting the display of the historic banners. Many of its other exponents have also been subjected to personal measures restricting access to San Siro, due to the protests that they are said to have promoted against the club’s top management at the end of last season.\n\nThe most evident characteristic of this story is the great hypocrisy that entirely permeates it, for a long time now, on the part of all those involved. The thousands of Ultras of the Curva for years chose, or allowed themselves to have imposed upon them, leaders with criminal records, always involved in illicit activities that have nothing to do with sporting passion and who used the availability to violence of their “troops” as a tool of intimidation. When this emerged to such an extent as to provoke the intervention of the judiciary, and the consequent convictions, albeit not final, the choice was not to distance themselves, to disassociate and renew their representation and leadership, but rather to deny the evidence and the investigative findings, to show unconditional solidarity and demand acquittal and release of the accused, victims of judicial persecution.\n\nAccused of being a “militia,” the Ultras, whether complicit, or poorly advised, appeared outside the courtroom, awaiting the verdict, in a kind of black-bloc uniform and in military formation. It is obvious that, in this way, they made easy the task of those in the Club who were waiting for nothing else in order to settle accounts, after last season’s demonstrations of dissent. Because what happened was indeed a settling of scores. Milan has always known perfectly well by whom, how, and for what purposes, not only sporting, the Ultras were directed. And it always turned the other way. Nor did it prevent them, for example, from using AIMC as a channel to facilitate “the second market” of season tickets and match tickets. Only when the Public Prosecutor’s Office demanded a stop to concessions that were being used to finance an organization led by a group of convicted criminals, again under investigation for very serious crimes (as demonstrated by the severity of the sentences imposed by the Court), did Milan pull the plug. But for years the Associazione Italiana Milan Club, also governed in a wholly non-transparent manner, came to terms with them. And for years the Club’s Supporter Liaison Officer evidently slept or was watching another film (as shown by the fact that the defense of the accused Ultras repeatedly called him to testify on their behalf).\n\nIn this context, just as it had previously done by not deliberating on the approval of about 250 APA members who are assignees of Milan shares, the Club’s leadership has decided to take advantage of the situation to deal an indiscriminate blow against all Ultras and to even more easily pursue its perverse plan. Supporters who become customers, buyers of shirts in the colors of Portugal and with the crests of Lanerossi Vicenza or Ascoli, collectors of bad taste and devoid of any real spirit of belonging. Passionate Milanisti who are being replaced in the stands by tourists with “all inclusive” packages complete with the “San Siro experience” and who certainly would not dream of inviting Cardinale, Scaroni, and Furlani to go do something else.\n\nSpectators devoid of any capacity for analysis and always satisfied with a modest performance put on by a team that claims to aspire only to fourth place and whose players all have a price at which they can be sold, in the name of economic sustainability that prevails over any sporting ambition. A pathetic network of courtiers who in the press and on social media continue to give credit to this ownership, without realizing that there is an ongoing scientific program of ethnic and genetic substitution of Rossoneri passion. So much for “Furlani is a Milanista, though” and “we are on the right track”! We can only hope that with certain choices running counter to the recent past (a coach with clear ideas and “ready”; a real sporting director) one might attempt the reconstruction of a Milan at least worthy of the name; and that the signings in the last transfer market allow us a season in which we reconcile with the game and the results. But knowing that none of this interests our ownership in the slightest, whose priorities are entirely different.\n\nA serious club would sit down at the table with what remains (probably the best part) of the Curva. It would explain what can no longer be tolerated. It would recognize the irreplaceable role of the Ultras in the support at the stadium. The Curva, for its part, should guarantee that what has happened will not be repeated, starting with its attitude toward the use of violence and its disinterest in any activity other than its unsurpassable display of sporting passion.

The top two teams in each four-team group will advance to the Knockout Round, leading to the World Cup Final on Friday, Nov. 22.All matches will be broadcast live via the IFCPF YouTube Channel.\n\n“The World Cup is the pinnacle of the game, and it’s a platform our players have always relished,” Sharp said. “While this squad will look different with four of our most experienced players unavailable, it has given us the opportunity to tap into the depth of our national team player pool and bring a fresh, new energy onto the world stage.”\n\nSharp, who will guide the USA for the fifth time in World Cup play, has selected nine players with previous World Cup experience, including eight who were part of the squad that earned a team-best fourth-place finish at the World Cup two years ago.\n\nMidfielder Ben Lindau (Chicago, Ill.) and forward Cameron DeLillo (Brandon, Pa.) each have been named to their team-leading fourth World Cup roster, followed by three-time selections goalkeeper Marc Estrella (Bakersfield, Calif.), defender Jacob Kaplan (Morganville, N.J.) and forwards Jacob Crumbley (Fortson, Ga.), Shea Hammond (Montclair, N.J.) and Nick Mayhugh (Gainesville, Va.).

Malwarebytes Labs reported on the vulnerability in February, urging users to deploy a patch.\n\nGoAnywhere MFT, which stands for managed file transfer, allows businesses to manage and exchange files in a secure and compliant way. According to its website, it caters to more than 3,000 organizations, predominantly ones with over 10,000 employees and 1B USD in revenue.\n\nBrightline was just one of the many victims on the list that Cl0p made using the same vulnerability. The day after the release of the GoAnywhere patch, the Clop ransomware gang contacted BleepingComputer and said they had used the flaw over ten days to steal data from 130 companies.\n\nFor many organizations, Brightline offers virtual behavioral and mental health services for the children of benefits-eligible employees. In this light, Brightline has published a list of covered entities impacted by the breach.\n\nInterestingly, the 964,000 number released by the US government may not be complete.\n\nAccording to the online resource Databreaches.net, by the end of May 3, 2023, the subtotal number of Brightline patients affected by the GoAnywhere incident stood at 1,081,716.\n\nAnother remarkable fact Databreaches.net disclosed is that the listing for Brightline on Cl0p’s leak site has disappeared. This is usually an indicator that the victim has paid, but there might be something else going on in this case, since Brightline has been exemplary at providing public information and details about the breach.\n\nData breach\n\nThere are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the victim of a data breach.\n\nCheck the vendor’s advice. Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.\n\nChange your password. You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a strong password that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a password manager choose one for you.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA). If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor. Some forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) can be phished just as easily as a password. 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can’t be phished.\n\nWatch out for fake vendors. The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor. Check the vendor website to see if they are contacting victims, and verify any contacts using a different communication channel.\n\nTake your time. Phishing attacks often impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions, and security alerts.\n\nAccording to the information provided by Brightline, no Social Security numbers or financial accounts were stolen, nor did the stolen files contain anything related to medical services, conditions, diagnoses, or claims for the plan participant or their dependent.\n\nIf you are affected by this data security incident, you should have received or will receive a letter (or letters, if you have dependents) from Brightline. Each letter will have a unique code for the member and/or dependent to register for free identity theft and credit monitoring. Brightline will also have a call center available to answer questions.

DFW used tax-exempt extendable commercial paper and taxable traditional commercial paper as interim financing tools for its $8.6 billion capital program. Dallas Fort Worth International Airport\n\nIn a quest for interim financing for an $8.6 billion capital program, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport jumped into the extendable commercial paper (ECP) market earlier this year to fund tax-exempt projects.\n\nECP has been used in public finance by issuers including water and power utilities, but not airports, making DFW a trailblazer for the sector, according to participants in the financing, which was selected as the Southwest region winner in The Bond Buyer's 2024 Deal of the Year awards .\n\n\"Given the fact you don't need the bank support because of the ability to remarket ECP for up to 180 days makes it nice and attractive,\" DFW Chief Financial Officer Chris Poinsatte said, adding he plans to share DFW's ECP experience with other airport CFOs.\n\nDFW, which has been using taxable traditional commercial paper backed by self-liquidity for several years for terminal projects, wanted to launch a tax-exempt interim-financing program and had been previously pitched ECP by its financial advisors, he said.\n\nLaura Alexander, a senior managing director at HilltopSecurities, the airport's co-financial advisor, said DFW did not have the capacity to do another CP program backed by self-liquidity and that an ECP program allowed the airport to forgo the cost of a bank line of credit to provide liquidity.\n\nWhile ECP, which is initially sold with maturities up to 90 days, was usually reserved for AA or higher-rated credits because of a reliance on market access to take out the debt, some high-A-rated issuers in other sectors tapped the market over the past year, she noted.\n\n\"In the event that there's a failed roll, the issuer has 180 days before an event of default to be able to pay it off or refinance it, or whatever,\" Alexander said. \"So 180 days is a pretty long time in the market cycle for lesser credits that could present more market risk.\"\n\nThe financing began in March with the creation of a $600M subordinate lien joint revenue extendable commercial paper note program with JPMorgan as the dealer. The ECP was issued as a series of notes with the final issuances/rolls occurring in early August and coming due in late October.\n\nThe ECP program earned ratings of P-1 from Moody's Ratings and A-1 from S&P Global Ratings, which boosted the rating to A-1-plus in August.\n\nMoody's said its rating \"reflects the high coverage of maturing commercial paper by DFW's sizable and stable liquidity balances; conservative asset allocation; limited exposure to any single money market funds or external liquidity provider; and detailed policies and procedures for managing the new self-liquidity commercial paper program.\"\n\nAs DFW prepared to take out the ECP with an August revenue bond sale, S&P upgraded the airport's bond rating to AA-minus from A-plus, citing its \"relatively\" strong enplanements, history of financial resiliency, and stable debt service coverage. The rating outlook, positive before the upgrade, was revised to stable at the higher rating.\n\nMoody's Ratings revised the outlook on DFW's A1 rating to positive from stable, saying the move reflects an increased likelihood the capital program would be completed \"without an undue increase in leverage.\"\n\nDallas Fort Worth International Airport Chief Financial Officer Chris Poinsatte said he plans to share DFW’s experience with tax-exempt extendable commercial paper for its capital program with other airport CFOs.\n\nPoinsatte said it was \"quite unusual\" to get upgraded at the start of a large capital program, noting the airport is using innovative off-site modular construction.\n\n\"In the case of Terminal F, we can build the base while we're building the rest of the terminal, and then you just wheel it in and put it on top of your base, and we're gonna build Terminal F in three years,\" he said. \"Nobody builds terminals in three years, and that reduces the risk significantly.\"\n\nThe debt was also rated A-plus by Fitch Ratings and AA by Kroll Bond Rating Agency, with stable outlooks.\n\nAn underwriting team led by Wells Fargo Securities priced $723.5 million of tax-exempt joint revenue refunding and improvement bonds that were not subject to the alternative minimum tax.\n\nThe deal refinanced $445 million of outstanding ECP and raised $305 million for the airport's $8.6 billion capital program, which includes the tear-down and reconstruction of Terminal C, two new piers that add nine gates, construction of a 15-gate Terminal F, and an electric central utility plant aimed at allowing DFW to achieve net zero carbon emissions.\n\nThe deal, which was structured as serial maturities from 2028 through 2045 and in 2049, as well as a 2048 term bond, featured 4%, 5%, and 5.25% coupons. Pricing resulted in a true interest cost of 4.02%. The bonds had an average life of 16.5 years.\n\n\"The underwriters were able to generate over $1.9 billion in orders, or roughly 2.7x aggregate subscription,\" the deal's nominating statement said. \"In total, the order book saw participation from 64 investors, which included at least six new investors to the DFW credit.\"\n\nThe financing team also navigated arbitrage issues with the help of tax counsel at McCall, Parkhurst & Horton by coordinating the timing of the ECP rolls with the Aug. 21 bond sale date.\n\n\"By rolling the ECP more than 15 days before the bond pricing and extending the ECP maturities, DFW took a calculated risk that the short-term investment earnings on the funds would exceed the rates paid on the ECP, which allowed DFW to save approximately $760,013 in net funding the escrow for the ECP,\" the nominating statement said.\n\nSiebert Williams Shank & Co. was co-senior manager for the bond deal, which included co-managers JPMorgan, Academy Securities, and Truist Securities. Co-bond counsel were McCall, Parkhurst & Horton and West & Associates. Hilltop and Estrada Hinojosa were co-financial advisors.\n\nAs the capital program progresses, Poinsatte said DFW will use \"all the tools in our toolbox,\" including ECP and traditional commercial paper, all of which will be actively managed.\n\nDFW, where American Airlines is the dominant carrier, was the second-busiest U.S. airport after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in terms of passenger traffic in 2023, according to Airports Council International-North America. It surpassed 2019's pre-pandemic passenger total of 75 million in 2023 with 81.76 million passengers.", "source_domain": "www.bondbuyer.com"}

The report also notes that the number of documented suicide attempts by young people also fell from 3.6% to 2.7%.\n\nThese findings create a sense of optimism among experts, given that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens (gun violence being the first). Jill Harkavy-Friedman, senior vice president of research at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told NPR that the study results are \"very promising\" and that the organization is hopeful about this upward trend.\n\nFlaws in the Report\n\nHowever, there's still work to be done and important disparities to be aware of. While SAMHSA's data is encouraging, the report does not break down the numbers into various demographics. According to NPR, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that a future report will detail that breakdown, including race and ethnicity.\n\nThese specifics are important because research has shown that suicide affects different groups of teens in disproportionate ways. For example, we know that LGBTQ+ youth are at higher risks of suicide than their heterosexual and/or cisgender peers, with LGBTQ+ young people of color at an even higher risk.\n\n\n\nWhat Parents Should Know\n\nWhile we can remain hopeful that this encouraging trend continues, it's still important to be mindful that suicide is a prevalent issue among young people today—and part of that has to do with health care access.\n\nThe SAMHSA report noted that 60% of teens experiencing a recent episode of depression received treatment. The widespread average is even less. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), an approximate 40% of adolescents with depression receive treatment.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why people can't access treatment, ranging from mental health stigma to insurance disparities, along with out-of-pocket costs and bias among medical providers.\n\n\"Stigma and shame have long interfered with receiving adequate behavioral health care,\" Victor Fornari, M.D., a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Zucker Hillside Hospital, Northwell Health in Queens, New York, previously told Parents. \"Mental health is part of overall health. There is no health without mental health.\"\n\nSigns Your Child May Need Mental Health Treatment\n\nIt's important for parents and caregivers to pay attention to their teen's behavior, mood, and overall well-being. If you notice any of the following, please consider speaking with a health care provider or therapist:\n\nDramatic changes in eating or sleeping habits\n\nLoss of interest in activities they previously enjoyed\n\nWithdrawal from friends and family\n\nSubstance use\n\nHeightened interest or obsession with death and dying\n\nGiving away or destroying possessions\n\nExtreme mood swings\n\nIf you are concerned that your child is in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, call 988 immediately to find support through the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\nFurther, it is important to know that you aren't alone.

Introduction\n\n\n\nEvery year, Mental Health Awareness Week invites us to pause and think about something we all share: the need for emotional and psychological well-being. It’s not just about talking; it’s about understanding why mental health awareness matters and learning simple ways to participate that make a real difference.\n\n\n\n2. What Is Mental Health Awareness Week?\n\n\n\nMental Health Awareness Week is an annual campaign dedicated to shining a light on emotional well-being and encouraging conversations about mental health. It was first introduced by organisations committed to breaking stigma and promoting open discussions. Unlike awareness days that focus on a single issue, this week-long event offers space to highlight different themes each year, from anxiety to loneliness, mindfulness to resilience.\n\n\n\nAt its heart, this week is about education and empathy. It provides an opportunity for schools, workplaces, families, and communities to unite in building healthier environments. People can attend workshops, join campaigns, or take small personal steps to reflect on their mental health.\n\n\n\nThink of it as a reminder: just like we maintain our physical health, our minds need consistent care. This week is not a once-a-year gesture; it’s a gateway to long-term habits that foster mental wellness and community support.\n\n\n\n3. Why It Matters\n\n\n\nSo, why does mental health awareness matter? Conversations about mental health are often avoided, leaving many to struggle in silence. By dedicating a week to these discussions, we challenge stigma and normalise seeking help. It shows that mental health is just as important as physical health—both deserve equal care and attention.\n\n\n\nWhen we raise awareness, we create space for empathy. Someone who may have felt isolated realises they are not alone. A simple conversation can encourage a friend, neighbour, or colleague to seek support they’ve been postponing.\n\n\n\nThe importance of awareness also extends to lifestyle choices. For example, research shows that even physical health factors such as nutrition can influence mood. A lack of certain vitamins, like vitamin B12 and mood, can contribute to feelings of fatigue, stress, and low energy. Understanding these connections deepens our awareness of how body and mind are linked.\n\n\n\nBy engaging in Mental Health Awareness Week, we also influence wider communities. Employers become more open to supporting staff, schools prioritise students’ well-being, and families foster healthier conversations at home. Awareness matters because it is the first step toward collective healing.\n\n\n\n4. Benefits of Getting Involved\n\n\n\nThe benefits of participating in Mental Health Awareness Week go beyond showing support; they ripple into every corner of life. On a personal level, involvement helps us recognise our own mental health needs. Whether it’s joining a community event, reflecting through journaling, or simply taking a mindful walk, small acts foster a sense of balance.\n\n\n\nFor others, your involvement sends a powerful message: “You’re not alone.” A simple gesture—like sharing an uplifting post online or listening to a friend—can brighten someone’s day. Awareness weeks remind us that kindness is contagious.\n\n\n\nParticipation also strengthens communities. When people come together for events or discussions, it creates a sense of unity. Collective efforts reduce stigma, encourage open dialogue, and make mental health support more accessible.\n\n\n\nAnother key benefit is education. By engaging in talks, reading resources, or exploring self-help tools, we build a stronger understanding of mental wellness. This equips us to make informed choices and share knowledge with those around us.\n\n\n\nIn short, the benefits are both personal and social. By showing up, we empower ourselves, encourage others, and contribute to a culture that values mental well-being.\n\n\n\n5. Simple Ways to Participate\n\n\n\nParticipation doesn’t need to be complicated. The most powerful contributions are often the simplest. Here are practical ways you can join in:\n\n\n\n5.1 Use Your Voice—Online and Offline\n\n\n\nA simple conversation can change a life. Share encouraging messages on social media, post about mental health facts, or simply check in with someone you care about. Online platforms give us the power to reach thousands, but face-to-face conversations hold equal value.\n\n\n\nImagine you’re planting seeds. Each post, conversation, or message plants a seed of understanding in someone’s mind. Over time, these seeds grow into acceptance and support. You don’t need to be an expert—just be willing to listen, learn, and share.\n\n\n\nBy using your voice, you amplify awareness. Even a short message such as, “Mental health matters just as much as physical health,” can start meaningful discussions.\n\n\n\n5.2 Join or Support Events\n\n\n\nCommunities everywhere host events during Mental Health Awareness Week. These can range from educational workshops to fundraising walks. You don’t need to attend every event—choose one that feels manageable and meaningful.\n\n\n\nEven virtual participation counts. Many organisations now stream events online, making it easier than ever to join. When you show up, you not only learn but also contribute to a movement larger than yourself.\n\n\n\nSupporting events is like adding a brick to a growing wall of awareness. Each person who attends strengthens the foundation of a healthier, more understanding society.\n\n\n\n5.3 Learn More & Educate Yourself\n\n\n\nKnowledge is power. Use this week to dive into reliable resources—whether that’s reading articles, exploring toolkits, or checking out new mental health tools. The more we know, the better we can support ourselves and others.\n\n\n\nStart small: read a blog, watch a short video, or explore a downloadable toolkit provided by trusted organisations. Education doesn’t mean cramming information—it’s about opening your mind to perspectives you hadn’t considered before.\n\n\n\nBy taking time to learn, you build resilience. You also become better equipped to spot signs of stress, anxiety, or burnout in yourself and others.\n\n\n\n5.4 Practice Self-Care & Mindfulness\n\n\n\nSelf-care is not selfish—it’s survival. During Mental Health Awareness Week, make space for habits that recharge your mind and body. That could mean journaling, meditation, or simply getting enough sleep.\n\n\n\nDeveloping daily habits makes a big difference. For example, starting the day with gratitude journaling or ending it with a mindful walk sets the tone for calm and clarity.\n\n\n\nAnd if stress weighs heavily, remember there are proven strategies for stress relief. From breathing exercises to gentle stretching, small routines can ease pressure and bring focus back to the present moment.\n\n\n\n5.5 Share Stories or Listen\n\n\n\nPersonal stories hold immense power. Whether you share your own or simply listen to others, storytelling builds empathy. Sometimes, all a person needs is to feel heard. By opening up or offering a safe space, you create connections that heal.\n\n\n\n5.6 Volunteer or Donate\n\n\n\nSupport goes beyond words. If possible, volunteer your time with mental health organisations or donate to trusted charities. Even a small contribution helps sustain services that provide counselling, crisis support, and educational resources.\n\n\n\n6. How Communities Make a Difference\n\n\n\nCommunities are the heart of Mental Health Awareness Week. When groups gather—whether in schools, workplaces, or neighbourhoods—they create a safety net. Events like community walks, group meditation, or discussion circles foster togetherness.\n\nThese efforts send a clear message: mental health awareness is not just individual—it’s collective. A community that values well-being builds resilience against isolation and stigma.\n\n\n\nBy participating, you’re not just supporting yourself; you’re reinforcing a network where everyone feels seen, valued, and supported.\n\n\n\n7. Tips for Staying Engaged All Year\n\n\n\nMental health awareness doesn’t end with the week—it’s a year-round commitment. The key is consistency, not intensity. Small, repeatable actions create lasting change.\n\n\n\nContinue checking in on loved ones, practising mindfulness, and sharing resources. Explore proven methods for stress relief that help maintain balance throughout the year.\n\n\n\nEven posting a monthly reminder online or engaging with community resources keeps momentum alive. Just like watering a plant, nurturing mental health requires regular attention. The more consistent we are, the stronger our collective well-being becomes.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nMental Health Awareness Week is more than a campaign—it’s a call to action. It reminds us why mental health awareness matters and how to participate in meaningful ways. By taking small steps, we not only care for ourselves but also help build a world where no one struggles alone.\n\n\n\nmental health awareness week, why mental health awareness matters, how to participate in mental health awareness week, mental wellness tips, self-care ideas, stress relief strategies, beginner mindfulness, mental health tools, community and mental health, simple mental health actions\n\n\n\n\n\n", "source_domain": "vocal.media"}

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nA subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee met Wednesday to discuss intercity passenger and high-speed rail. Members on both sides of the aisle largely expressed support for high-speed rail, but some Republicans took issue with the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco project that is over budget and lags behind its original timeline for completion.\n\n“I’m on the record supporting high-speed rail,” said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, adding, “I like the idea of that rail line between Houston and Dallas.” But Nehls said in his opening statement that the California project “has been plagued by a failure to account for actual costs” along with construction delays and land acquisition issues. “The California high-speed rail project shows the failures of poor planning and government incompetence,” he said.\n\nLee Ohanian, economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, testifying at the hearing, fielded Nehls’ questions about the challenges that California’s project faces. “California HSR began its life with $10 billion in voter-approved bond funding but without a legitimate business plan,” Ohanian said. “Some of this reflects mistakes in management and accountability, but it also reflects the failure to identify and mitigate the risks and uncertainties with projects of this size.”\n\nBut there is another California high-speed rail project both parties like: the Brightline West plan to connect Las Vegas and Southern California. The project is led by the same company that established 125-mph train service in Florida, a 235-mile line connecting Miami and Orlando with cities in between, largely built with private-sector investment.\n\n“Private sector HSR is incentivized to find routes where there’s substantial demand, which is what we all want, and they’re also incentivized to build efficiently, which is what we all want,” Ohanian said. “This suggests significant potential for private-public HSR partnerships.”\n\nNehls also questioned Austin, Texas, Mayor Kirk Watson about passenger rail and the proposed Texas Central HSR project to link Dallas and Houston. While Watson demurred that he wasn’t as knowledgeable about the high-speed rail project, he said, “I would argue that the Texas triangle is the lowest-hanging fruit in the nation for improving intercity passenger rail service.”\n\nReferring to the fast-growing metropolitan areas of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio, Watson said, “Projections show that the developing passenger rail service in that triangle will produce robust ridership with a relatively modest capital investment because of the population, the density of that population, the economy and the demographics.”\n\nDemocrats, led by Rep. Donald Payne of New Jersey, took the opportunity to lambast Republicans for looking to cut funding for Amtrak by about $1.6 billion in the 2024 fiscal budget. “Fortunately, these drastic cuts were too severe to pass the House, allowing the Senate to pursue a more balanced bill aligned with the success of the bipartisan infrastructure law,” Payne said. House Republicans have also looked to pass legislation blocking any federal funding for the LA-San Francisco California project.\n\nRepublican Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California, a longtime opponent of the California high-speed rail project, asked witness Stacey Mortensen a theoretical question as to whether she would abandon the project. Mortensen is the executive director of the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority, which oversees passenger rail service in a California region that includes the area where the high-speed project is now under construction.\n\n“I think at some point, a step has to be taken backward,” she replied. “I know there’s extreme pressure on the High-Speed Rail Authority to keep moving forward, to keep solving the problems, to keep finding the money.”\n\nThe California High-Speed Rail Authority and Brightline West are both vying for a slice of the $4.6 billion that will be available through the Federal Railroad Administration’s Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program for projects outside the Northeast Corridor.

The rail line is set to revolutionize travel between these two major cities, providing a modern, efficient alternative to current transportation options. With construction preparations moving forward, the project has entered the final phase of field evaluations, signaling that construction could soon begin.\n\nThe importance of Brightline West cannot be overstated. Currently, the United States does not have any fully operational high-speed rail systems, which are defined by the International Union of Railways as trains traveling at speeds exceeding 155 miles per hour on specialized tracks. This is in stark contrast to countries such as China, which boasts over 30,000 miles of high-speed rail infrastructure. Brightline West, however, plans to operate at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour, allowing the journey between Las Vegas and Southern California to be completed in roughly two hours. This rapid transit will mark a significant improvement in travel times, particularly between these two highly populated regions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project faces competition from the California High-Speed Rail, which is currently under construction between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Both Brightline West and California High-Speed Rail are in a race to become the first operational high-speed rail line in the U.S. With increasing demand for sustainable and efficient transportation solutions, Brightline West is poised to provide an essential link that could drastically reduce travel times and offer a more eco-friendly option compared to traditional travel methods.\n\nIn preparation for construction, Brightline West has conducted extensive field evaluations, including the collection and analysis of soil samples along the proposed route. These efforts, which have now been almost completed, will guide decisions on the track’s grading, station locations, and the necessary infrastructure to support the rail line. The project is now entering a crucial phase, with construction expected to ramp up in the coming months. The initial plan was to open the rail line in time for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, but delays have pushed this timeline further back.\n\nWhen completed, the Brightline West trains will be capable of traveling at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour, allowing passengers to travel between Las Vegas and Southern California in a fraction of the time it currently takes by car or plane. This high-speed option will offer travelers an alternative that is both faster and more environmentally friendly than other modes of transport, such as driving or flying.\n\nBrightline, the company behind this ambitious project, has already demonstrated success in high-speed rail with its Miami to Orlando line in Florida, which began operations in 2022. While the Florida line does not meet the official high-speed rail standards, it was the first privately operated rail line in the U.S. in over a century and has seen strong demand. This success has helped build confidence in the potential of rail travel in the U.S., with the Brightline West project now looking to build on this momentum.\n\nBeyond the Brightline West line itself, there are plans to expand the network further. A proposal known as the High-Speed Desert Corridor seeks to connect Brightline West to the California High-Speed Rail system through an additional rail link. If implemented, this expansion could lead to the creation of a vast high-speed rail network across key parts of the U.S., further enhancing the viability of rail as a mainstream transportation option.\n\nUltimately, the Brightline West project represents a pivotal step in modernizing U.S. transportation infrastructure. As the project moves closer to construction, it could serve as the catalyst for future high-speed rail development across the country. Whether Brightline West or California High-Speed Rail will become the first operational high-speed rail line in the U.S. remains to be seen, but with both projects making significant strides, high-speed rail is poised to become a viable travel option for millions of Americans in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement", "source_domain": "www.travelandtourworld.com"}

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch questioning attorney Neal Katyal, who is representing the state of Hawaii, which sued the Trump administration over the ban. Katyal, the former acting solicitor general of the United States. This begins with Justice Gorsuch.\n\nJUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH: I’m proceeding so far on the assumption that we can reach the merits. But the government makes the argument, for example, that aliens who are removed from this country have to bring their claims personally, and third parties can’t vindicate those rights of aliens being—who are present in this country, and asks the question why it should be that third persons should be able to assert the rights of aliens who are not present in this country. What’s the answer to that?\n\nNEAL KATYAL: Well, several. This is not a third-party case. These are United States citizens bringing this challenge in a state of the United States.\n\nJUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH: On behalf of aliens not present in the country.\n\nNEAL KATYAL: Well, but they are directly—they are directly harmed themselves. Let me just give you one example. Not just the state of Hawaii, whose university is directly impacted, but let’s just take, for example, Mr. al-Omari, the 10-year-old in the PARS Equality brief, Justice Breyer, that you were referring to. This is a 10-year-old daughter in Yemen who is trying to come here because she has cerebral palsy—\n\nJUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH: I understand that, but those arguments don’t—\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to the issue of that 10-year-old Yemeni girl with cerebral palsy, mentioned by Neal Katyal during the Supreme Court oral arguments. She is featured in a new Al Jazeera documentary called “Between War and the Ban: A Yemeni-American Story,” which tells the story of Yemenis trying to come to the U.S., often to reunite with family members. In this clip, her father, a U.S. citizen named Najeeb al-Omari, talks to reporter Sharif Abdel Kouddous of Fault Lines about his daughter’s deteriorating medical condition and the U.S. denial of visas for his daughter.\n\nNAJEEB AL-OMARI: [translated] All the problems are after the war. There is no medical care. The medical system and the country have collapsed. Her condition is a consequence of the war.\n\nSHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Najeeb’s eldest daughter, 11-year-old Shaima, was born with cerebral palsy, making it more urgent for her to get adequate medical care, something that’s become increasingly difficult in Yemen.\n\nNAJEEB AL-OMARI: [translated] Proper medicine isn’t available. Only substitutes. But the substitutes are smuggled through the desert, and the heat ruins them.\n\nSHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: [translated] How did that affect her?\n\nNAJEEB AL-OMARI: It really affected her. Look at her now. She wasn’t like this before.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Again, that clip from Al Jazeera English, Sharif Abdel Kouddous’s report. Diala Shamas, tell us about this family, this little girl that her father is saying she can’t get the medicines in Yemen. Now they’re in Djibouti. They can’t even afford to stay there. He did not think this was going to be an issue. He himself is an American citizen, and she is just deteriorating.\n\nDIALA SHAMAS: Yeah. So, Mr. al-Omari’s case is very illustrative of—and the reason, I think, in part, why it was brought up at the Supreme Court was this is a family who, at the very least, should be given a waiver under the travel ban or the proclamation. So the waivers came as something that’s in the proclamation that allows consular officers to provide a waiver on a case-by-case basis to anybody who meets a sort of set criteria that’s set out in that proclamation.\n\nSo, you would be covered by the ban if you’re a Yemeni national; however, a consular officer may provide this discretionary waiver if they believe that it would cause undue hardship to not be allowed entry, and if it were in the best interest of the United States, and if it doesn’t present—if entry wouldn’t present a threat to national security. And then it goes on to list some examples of who may be eligible for a waiver. And young Shaima fits several of the criteria. She’s trying to rejoin her parents. She has an extreme medical condition.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: She’s just laying there in bed, and he said she was not always like this.\n\nDIALA SHAMAS: She deteriorated while in Djibouti. And she was denied a waiver. So, she actually has a letter denying her visa and also saying she was found ineligible for a waiver. So this is really emblematic of the sense of chaos that the administration has had from the start and from the get-go around the travel ban. So people like Mr. al-Omari are trying to navigate the system, are trying to do their best to try to petition for waivers, but look everywhere for guidance on how to do that, and aren’t able to find any.\n\nSo you would think that at least with her, and, frankly, many others—you know, she’s a very extreme case that’s illustrative of this problem, but there are so many other people that we met in Djibouti who should qualify for a waiver. And yet, what we know is that nobody has been getting them. And so they’re sitting there in Djibouti under extremely difficult conditions. Djibouti is an extremely expensive country to live in, in part because the economy is inflated due to so many foreign military bases, including the U.S. military base. And so they’re spending thousands of dollars a month, usually borrowing from relatives here in the U.S., to simply be able to sustain themselves for months and months, and, in some cases, years.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, let’s go to a clip from yesterday’s oral arguments at the Supreme Court on the question of the waivers. This is Justice Stephen Breyer and Solicitor General Noel Francisco. The clip begins with Breyer.\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: I looked at this order, and this has case-by-case exceptions. And then it says—you know, it says case-by-case waivers may be appropriate in individual circumstances, such as—giving some examples—the following. And then they have to be no terrorists. Well, that’s the law anyway. And they have to be in the interest of the United States, and there can’t be undue hardship, which—the only time the word “hardship” appears in the immigration law is it says “extreme hardship.” So, undue must be less than extreme. In countries of 150 million people altogether, there must be quite a few who have—do fall within that class. So—\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: Well, yes, Your Honor, but there’s only a small number of people that seek to come into our country.\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: Well, well, that’s what I’m asking about, you see.\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: Yeah, yeah.\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: That’s now—if you think—now, as far as we’re concerned, if they fall within that class, there’s no reason given here why they should be excluded, other than the normal processes.\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: Well, a couple of responses, Your Honor. First, in terms of the numbers—\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: I’m not asking about the numbers.\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: Oh, you’re not asking. So—\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: I don’t want to ask about the numbers.\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: So, in terms of the reason they should be excluded—\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: Yeah.\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: One of the principal purposes of the proclamation is to exert diplomatic pressure on governments in order to get them to change and provide us with [inaudible] information.\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: So you think they should be excluded.\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: Not if they meet the criterion or the—\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: Not if they meet the criteria. OK.\n\nNOEL FRANCISCO: For the waiver.\n\nJUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER: OK.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: So, Lee Gelernt, that’s a discussion about the waiver program.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Could you explain how that’s been applied so far, and also the question of, if this ban is kept in effect, whether there’s any likelihood, depending on how the decision is written, that other countries could be added to the list?\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right. Those are both important questions. Taking the second one, we don’t know how the opinion is going to be written, but there certainly would seem to be no reason, if they uphold the travel ban, that additional countries could not be added. So I don’t think anybody should assume that it’s just these countries or it’s going to be reduced. I mean, it’s certainly possible they’ll take countries off. They took Chad off. But they also potentially could add countries if they claim those countries now meet the criteria.\n\nOn the waiver, I think Diala put it right. There is just chaos. What came out of the argument is that there’s only been 430 waivers. There’s 150 million people covered by the ban. And if this 10-year-old little girl is not getting a waiver, then it’s hard to imagine the criteria are being applied correctly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: One of the things I was astounded by is Noel Francisco saying, you know, “If anyone found that they were being discriminated against, they could just appeal the decision.” Any individual.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right. I’m not sure how that would happen. And I think the government has not been all that transparent about the waivers, and so that’s a problem on top of all the problems created by the travel ban generally.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I want to go to another case that you’ve been working on, which is related—\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: —which has to do—earlier this week, you presented arguments in a case involving 1,400 Iraqis who are slated for deportation from the U.S.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Could you explain what the case is and who these Iraqis are?\n\nLEE GELERNT: Yeah. So these Iraqis are primarily Christian or minority sect Muslims. They’ve been living in the country for decades.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The U.S.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Sorry, in the United States, for decades. Some—they all have final orders of removal based—some of them, no conviction or minor convictions, but there’s a range of convictions. But they have been living here forever because Iraq would not take them back. So they’ve all settled into life here. They have raised children. They’ve raised families. And they’ve been reporting every year, and they’ve been living peacefully in the country. And every prior administration has allowed them to stay.\n\nWell, the Trump administration now convinced Iraq to take them back. So, so be it, they’re going to send them back. We don’t think they should be sent back. But the really horrendous part is that they said, “We’re going to round them up all immediately and deport them right away,” without giving them a chance to go back to court to show that if they’re sent back to Iraq now, as Christians, as minority sect Muslims, they are in danger of being tortured or killed by ISIS or other groups.\n\nAnd all we said to the federal court is, “Give them some time to show that they’re going to be tortured.” The Trump administration said, “No, we’re going to remove them in two days. So be it.” And so, a federal district court said, “Look, I’m going to slow the process down so each one of them can go in and show that they are in serious danger if they’re going to be removed.” The federal court did that, just simply slowed down the process; didn’t say anybody has the right to remain here permanently, slowed the process down.\n\nThe Trump administration decided to appeal that order to the court of appeals. So I argued that case yesterday in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, and the government said the district court did not have authority even to slow the process down to allow these individuals to show that they’d be tortured.\n\nUnfortunately, the Trump administration is rounding up lots of groups en masse around the country—Christian Indonesians, Cambodians, Somalis—and I think there’s going to be more—and not giving them any time to show that they’re going to be tortured or killed if sent back. These are individuals who have been living in the country for decades, and yet now they’re giving no time. And when federal judges have said, “Why do it so quickly? They’ve been here for decades, At least give them a little time,” the administration has said, “Our mission is to remove people.” And so it just looks like they’re trying to get the numbers of deportations up, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Lee, before we wrap up, can you talk about the family separation case you’ve been working on?\n\nLEE GELERNT: Yeah, I’ve been doing this work for over 25 years. The family separation practice is as horrific as anything I’ve ever seen. They are separating asylum-seeking mothers and fathers at the border from their little children, children 18 months, 2 years, 3 years. And they don’t actually have any rationale that they can present in court. The true reason is they want to deter legitimate asylum seekers from coming to this country, and so they’re using the most draconian measure possible: taking a little kid away.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in this case is a Congolese mom and her 7-year-old daughter who made it to this country. They passed their initial asylum screening, so they’re legitimate asylum seekers. The mother, after four days, was put in another room and handcuffed, and said, “You’re going to be detained here in San Diego.” She heard her little girl, then 6, in the other room screaming, “Please don’t take me away from my mommy! Please!” The girl was taken away to Chicago. The mother wasn’t even told where the little girl was going for four days. They were separated for four months.\n\nAfter the ACLU brought a lawsuit, the government said, “Well, we weren’t really sure it was the true mom.” The judge said, “Why not just give her a DNA test?” They gave her a DNA test. Of course it was the mom. And anybody could have seen, by the way she was screaming for her mother, that it was the mom. The New York Times has now just reported that there are 700 kids who have been separated from their families. We have a class action case going on, where there’s a hearing in San Diego, May 4th. We are hoping the judge will order that all these kids be reunited with their parents and the practice be stopped going forward.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, Lee, what’s your sense, though? I mean, this is—as you’ve said, it’s quite a widespread practice of the Trump administration.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Is there any way to stop them? I mean, will the courts come forward? I mean, we just reported on the Supreme Court.\n\nLEE GELERNT: Right.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: It seems likely that they’re going to uphold the travel ban. Is there any reason to think that these other courts will act in a way to prevent these kinds of mass deportations?\n\nLEE GELERNT: Yeah, all I can say is we’re hopeful. And what we’ve been heartened by is that sometimes a practice is so draconian that it doesn’t just split along normal ideological lines. Even people who don’t necessarily agree with us on the macro immigration policy issues are coming forward, Republicans and Democrats, and saying, “Look, enough is enough. You cannot be separating an 18-month-old child.” We’re hoping that maybe even the administration says, “Hey, maybe we need to relook at this.”\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank you both for being with us. Of course, we’ll continue to follow this, and the ban decision will come down from the Supreme Court in June. Lee Gelernt is ACLU’s national Immigrants’ Rights Project, he’s with it. And Diala Shamas is with the Center for Constitutional Rights. Special thanks to Al Jazeera English and Sharif Abdel Kouddous for that report. This is Democracy Now!

Following a medical evaluation on March 15, a Moscow court approved Tater's involuntary admission to the psychiatric hospital.\n\nDoctors described Tater as showing signs of \"tension, impulsivity, persecutory delusions, and lack of self-awareness regarding his condition,\" leading to the court's decision to have him hospitalized.\n\nTater was originally scheduled to stand trial on April 14 on charges of assaulting a police officer, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTater's detention for medical reasons follows his release from pre-trial detention in late March, though it is unclear when the court made the decision to hospitalize him. At a court hearing in September, Tater claimed he had come to Russia seeking political asylum, alleging that he was being persecuted by the CIA.\n\nHis defense lawyer has appealed the decision to forcibly hospitalize him, accusing Russian authorities of attempting to \"isolate the defendant from society,\" according to Russian state media.\n\nHuman rights organizations have long criticized Russia for using psychiatric institutions to detain individuals with political views opposed to the government, a practice that dates back to Soviet times.\n\nThese groups claim that the Russian government under President Vladimir Putin has increasingly resorted to this tactic in recent years. Tater had already served 15 days in jail for the same incident after being found guilty of administrative charges for \"petty hooliganism.\"\n\nTater’s case adds to the growing list of Americans detained in Russia on drug or assault-related charges, many of whom are serving lengthy prison sentences. Other Americans, such as Robert Gilman, 72, who was sentenced to 3.5 years for assaulting a police officer after a drunken disturbance, and Travis Leake, a musician sentenced to 13 years for drug charges in July 2024, have faced similar fates in Russia's legal system.", "source_domain": "kyivindependent.com"}

LEARN MORE\n\nBrandon Harrison as a child. (Richard Harrison)\n\nIt's news Harrison's father, Richard, had been waiting for; a small sense of peace for him, but also, he hopes, for other families.\n\n“That’s going to save lives. That’s going to send a message out,\" Richard said.\n\nHe said Brandon, like him, relied heavily on his Christian faith.\n\n“I’ll never forget, one time, my wife had hurt herself,\" Richard said. \"And so, Brandon was probably 3 years old, he went over and prayed for her.”\n\nThose prayers changed as Brandon battled his drug addiction.\n\n\"I was always praying for his protection,\" Richard said.\n\nHe remembered one of his last conversations with Brandon, during his last relapse.\n\n“I said, ‘Brandon, what’s going on?’ He goes, ‘Dad, you always know.'\" Richard recalled. \"I said, ‘Well, what’s going on, man?’ He said, ‘Man, I’m trying, I’m fighting through it.’”\n\nBrandon Harrison (left), and his dad, Richard (right). (Richard Harrison)\n\nAccording to the arrest document, Harrison was staying in a sober living facility when he was found unconscious by his roommate.\n\nJosh Estes, one of his roommates, was home at the time.\n\n“The next thing I know, waking up from a nap and hearing somebody yell down the hallway, that’s when we found out,\" he said.\n\nEstes said he only knew Brandon for a few weeks, but they got close.\n\n\"I’m a huge chess nut and he was really the only one that was worth playing in the house,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators said they didn't see any signs of trauma or foul play, but did discover in Harrison's pocket a small clear baggie containing a blue pill marked M30 and a small crystal-like rock.\n\nEstes has been recovering from drug abuse, himself, for two years. He said there was no indication Brandon had relapsed.\n\n“My first thought is inward, ‘Where did I go wrong? What could I have done different? How could I have stopped it? How could I have prevented it?’\" said Estes, who had played a game of chess with Brandon the night before his death. “Maybe five more minutes at the chess board, you know, something.”\n\nEstes said he works at a rehabilitation center now and sees how pervasive fentanyl is. He said there is some relief in knowing suppliers and dealers are being prosecuted.\n\n\"People don’t understand how serious fentanyl is until you get slapped with a murder charge,\" he said. “It can’t be expressed enough how serious it is.”\n\nAccording to documents, Richard helped investigators catch the suspect by giving them his son's phone and access code. Detectives found text messages between Harrison and an unidentified person arranging delivery of percs and meth outside the restaurant where he worked as a waiter.\n\nPercs, police said, is slang for counterfeit Oxycodone pills that contain fentanyl. The pills are typically small, marked M30, and, though they can come in a variety of colors, appear legitimate. Because they are counterfeit, police said they may contain lethal amounts of fentanyl or meth and are extremely dangerous.\n\nIn the arrest document, police said they contacted the person who delivered the percs and meth and set up another meeting. During that meeting, police said a clear baggy with six small blue pills marked WW27 was seen in Lindsay's lap and, when the car door was opened, they spilled onto the driver's seat, floorboard, and the ground.\n\n\"Officers believed these to be the counterfeit pills Jacob brought to deliver to Brandon,\" police said.\n\nA mobile field test indicated the pills were presumptive positive for fentanyl.\n\nTarrant County Jail Tarrant County Jail\n\nLindsay, police said, consented to a search of his mobile phone and investigators found a text conversation between him and Harrison where he agreed to deliver drugs to him at his job along with a conversation with police setting up the second meeting.\n\nLindsay was originally charged with delivery of a controlled substance. The murder charge was added after the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office completed Harrison's autopsy and determined his cause of death to be fentanyl and methamphetamine toxicity.\n\nRichard is grateful for law enforcement's work, and, he said, their grace and support during this difficult time.\n\n“My prayer life completely changed. I was always praying for his protection. Now, I just thank God that I had him for 26 years,\" Richard said.\n\nA strong faith that he still shares with his son.\n\n“I know that God’s taking care of me. I also know that my son’s up there with Him right now,\" he said, adding that Brandon is finally clean from his drug addiction. \"I know I’ll see him again. One day.”\n\nFort Worth Police said while there are no other arrests expected connected to Harrison's death, the fentanyl overdose narcotics unit will continue pursuing those distributing fentanyl illegally and will charge those in violation of state law to the fullest extent.\n\nRichard said Brandon's story has inspired his younger brother (pictured, left), who is in the Dallas police academy, to become part of the narcotics unit. “He wants to make sure that he makes a difference, too, for his brother, and get those guys off the street,\" Richard said. (Richard Harrison)\n\nWHAT IS FENTANYL?\n\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. Just two milligrams of fentanyl, which is equal to 10-15 grains of table salt, is considered a lethal dose.\n\nWithout laboratory testing, there is no way to know how much fentanyl is concentrated in a pill or powder. If you encounter fentanyl in any form, do not handle it and call 911 immediately.\n\nFentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing this country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 107,622 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2021, with 66% of those deaths related to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\n\nDrug poisonings are the leading killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Fentanyl available in the United States is primarily supplied by two criminal drug networks, the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).\n\nWHAT IS RAINBOW FENTANYL?\n\nIn August 2022 the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a public advisory about the alarming emerging trend of colorful fentanyl available nationwide.\n\nBrightly-colored fentanyl, dubbed \"rainbow fentanyl\" in the media, is being seized in multiple forms, including pills, powder, and blocks that resemble sidewalk chalk.\n\n“Rainbow fentanyl—fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes, and sizes—is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “The men and women of the DEA are relentlessly working to stop the trafficking of rainbow fentanyl and defeat the Mexican drug cartels that are responsible for the vast majority of the fentanyl that is being trafficked in the United States.”\n\nDespite claims that certain colors may be more potent than others, there is no indication through DEA’s laboratory testing that this is the case. The DEA said every color, shape, and size of fentanyl should be considered extremely dangerous.\n\nOfficials from the Drug Enforcement Administration are warning of fentanyl appearing in bright colors, sometimes resembling sidewalk chalk or candy.\n\nWhat is Narcan?\n\nNarcan is an over-the-counter, prepackaged nasal spray containing naloxone hydrochloride, which is an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose, but only temporarily.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, \"Narcan nasal spray is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of a known or suspected opioid overdose emergency with signs of breathing problems and severe sleepiness or not being able to respond.\"\n\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, naloxone is an FDA-approved medication that is used to reverse an opioid overdose.\n\nSAMHSA said that because naloxone is a temporary treatment, its effects do not last long, and it's critical to obtain medical intervention as soon as possible after administering or receiving naloxone.\n\nMarin Wolf with The Dallas Morning New tells NBC 5 about the life-saving training.\n\nWhat is naloxone?\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Drug Abuse, naloxone is a medicine that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose by attaching itself to opioid receptors and either reversing or blocking the effects of opioids.\n\n\"Naloxone can quickly restore normal breathing to a person if their breathing has slowed or stopped because of an opioid overdose. But naloxone does not affect someone who does not have opioids in their system, and it is not a treatment for opioid use disorder. Examples of opioids include heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), codeine, and morphine.\n\nNaloxone comes in two FDA-approved forms, injectable and as a nasal spray.\n\nNaloxone works for only 30 to 90 minutes and many opioids remain in the body longer than that. It is possible for a person to still experience the effects of an overdose after a dose of naloxone wears off so it's imperative to call 911 or get the overdosing person medical attention as soon as possible after the dose is administered.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 29, 2023, approved selling naloxone without a prescription, setting the overdose-reversing drug on course to become the first opioid treatment drug to be sold over the counter.\n\nA different drug, Opvee (nalmefene) is also an emergency nasal spray medication used to reverse an opioid overdose. Opvee, however, is not approved for over-the-counter use and can only be obtained with a prescription. Nalmefene stays in the body longer than naloxone and may be more effective for overdoses caused by long-acting opioids but it also may come with more opioid withdrawal symptoms.\n\nDoes the FDA approval mean I can buy Narcan at drug stores?\n\nYes. Narcan is currently available over the counter at pharmacies.\n\nOther brands of nasal sprays (RiVive) and injectables have also been approved for over-the-counter sale.", "source_domain": "www.nbcdfw.com"}

SCOTLAND AND IRELAND\n\nThe CP MNT are 2W-0L-0D against Scotland during the team’s modern era (2014-present). The USA earned a 2-1 victory on June 19, 2015 at the IFCPF World Cup before a goal from Shea Hammond helped propel the side to a 2-0 win at the Tri-Nations Cup on March 13, 2022. Both matches were played in Burton-upon-Trent, England.\n\nThe USA holds a 2W-2L-1D modern era record against Ireland, going unbeaten in the last three matches, in a streak that dates back to 2016. The run began with a 2-1 U.S. win on Sept. 14, 2016 at the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before Cameron DeLillo’s brace pushed the USA to a 3-2 victory on Sept. 22, 2017 at the IFCPF World Cup in San Luis, Argentina. The most recent meeting again came at the World Cup, with Nick Mayhugh’s 14th minute goal ensuring the USA earned a 1-1 draw and a top of the group finish on July 12, 2019 in Seville, Spain.\n\nAbout the U.S. Men’s CP National Team\n\nThe U.S. CP Men’s National Team is for eligible qualifying players with Cerebral Palsy, stroke or traumatic brain injury.

He had been reported missing late one evening in June 2012. Police suspected he was planning to take a bus.\n\nMonths after the attempted escape, late in 2012, he was sentenced to a year in a military prison. After a bad conduct discharge in 2014, Kelley moved to Colorado, where he was cited on an animal cruelty charge for allegedly beating a dog.\n\nHe remarried and moved to New Braunfels, Texas, about 35 miles from the tiny town of Sutherland Springs, where police say he killed 26 people, including an unborn child, and injured 20, at the First Baptist church before he was shot twice by a civilian and fled in his SUV. The 26-year-old was found dead a couple of miles from the scene, seemingly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA couple who survived, Joaquin Ramirez and his partner, Roseanne Solis, told KSAT local news that after an initial hail of gunfire, Kelley went through the church shooting anyone who made a noise, including children.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are trying to determine a motive for the mass slaughter, and on Monday said that there was a “domestic situation” that included threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who was known to attend the church but was not present on Sunday.\n\nInvestigators have so far been unable to access Kelley’s phone because of its security protections and have sent it to FBI headquarters in Virginia, Chris Combs, an FBI special agent, said at a Tuesday news conference.\n\nThe US air force said in a statement on Monday that the base failed to enter the record of Kelley’s domestic violence conviction into the national background check system for firearms sales. Had they done so it would have raised red flags when he attempted to buy guns. A Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives official said on Monday that Kelley purchased four guns between 2014 and 2017; he had a rifle and two handguns with him on Sunday.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com"}

"full_text": "The Department of Homeland Security may not use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement purposes and the Department of Health and Human Services may not share the protected patient information, according to a federal court ruling.\n\nThis past week, a federal judge ruled that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had improperly accessed protected health information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including U.S. citizens.\n\nICE's access to that medical data has raised concerns that individuals may avoid seeking necessary care out of fear their private information would be shared – compromising public health and potentially increasing states' healthcare costs.\n\nThat prompted a multistate lawsuit, which has led to the Department of Homeland Security being precluded from using the Center for Medicaid & Medicare Services' data obtained for immigration enforcement purposes.\n\nThat includes data already acquired, until the termination of this litigation or 14 days after DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services complete \"a reasoned decisionmaking process,\" according to the judge's ruling.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nIn the complaint brought against President Donald Trump’s administration last month in Northern California federal court, attorney generals from 20 states – California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – sought to bar use of Medicaid data for immigration enforcement and deportation purposes.\n\nThe attorneys general argued that the administration \"abruptly changed, without notice, opportunity for public input, or reasoned decision-making\" its policy of keeping state Medicaid agencies’ healthcare records confidential in their lawsuit filed July 1.\n\nBecause ICE had a policy against using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement purposes, which had been publicized to states, medical providers and Medicaid patients since 2013, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said he would grant them a partial preliminary injunction.\n\nMedicaid data from several states, which could include Children’s Health Insurance Program data, was shared with ICE officials, according to the complaint.\n\nThat action, they argued, would compromise the health of individuals experiencing emergencies and leave states and their safety net hospitals footing the bill for federally mandated emergency healthcare services.\n\n\"If members of our community cannot trust that the government will keep their medical history and other personal data safe, they will think twice about going to the doctor when needed,\" the attorneys general said.\n\n\"Congress itself extended coverage and federal funds for emergency Medicaid to all individuals residing in the United States, even those who lack satisfactory immigration status,\" they noted.\n\nThey also asked for immediate relief to protect state data and \"to bar the federal government from reneging on the terms of the longstanding State/federal Medicaid partnership,\" and the judge agreed the attorneys proved their claims that the federal decision to share the PII was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n\"It appears that ICE is primarily focused on obtaining current address information for people who are in the country unlawfully,\" Chhabria wrote. \"But CMS appears to have granted ICE unfettered access to all information about all Medicaid patients in the United States, whether citizens or noncitizens.\"\n\nHowever, Chhabria denied the plaintiffs' request to require the federal agencies to undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking before deciding whether to change their policies because \"several federal statutes appear to permit, and sometimes even require, agencies to provide such information to DHS upon request.\"\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nAs part of Trump's executive order, Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders, CMS said in May that it would crack down on Medicaid funding for immigrants and act \"decisively\" to ensure funds are used for eligible individuals only.\n\nThen in June, federal health agency staff were asked to release personally identifiable information for Medicaid enrollees in seven states – California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado – that permit non-U.S. citizens to enroll.\n\nAll U.S. states are required to offer temporary emergency Medicaid coverage that pays just for lifesaving services in emergency rooms to anyone, including non-U.S. citizens, who are lawfully present or not.\n\nBut ICE was provided access to the personal data of the 79 million Medicaid enrollees to help track down immigrants who may not be living legally in the United States, according to a data-sharing agreement between CMS and DHS reportedly obtained by The Associated Press in mid-July.\n\nThat agreement allowed ICE to access the data between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, through Sept. 9.\n\n\"It’s unthinkable that CMS would violate the trust of Medicaid enrollees in this way,\" Hannah Katch, a former CMS adviser, had told the AP.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"Everyone should be able to seek medical care without fear of what the federal government may do with that information,\" said Nick Brown, attorney general of Washington state, in a statement following the injunction.\n\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nHealthcare IT News is a

{"url": "https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/opinions/medicaid-cuts-will-heighten-the-us-mental-health-and-substance-use-crisis/", "title": "Medicaid Cuts Will Heighten the US Mental Health and Substance Use Crisis", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)’s cuts to Medicaid will heighten the nation’s behavioral health crisis. Nationally, each year an estimated 20 to 25% of children and adults have a mental illness1 and 17% of adults and 9% of adolescents have a substance use disorder. Medicaid is the single largest payer of mental health and substance use services in the United States, and the burden of behavioral health conditions is higher among Medicaid enrollees. Among the 17% of US adults ages 19-64 covered by Medicaid, 35% have a mental illness and 24% have a substance use disorder. Medicaid also covers 40% of children, 30% of whom have a behavioral health condition. In 2020, the drug overdose rate among Medicaid beneficiaries of all ages was 54.6 per 100,000 people, more than twice the national average.2\n\nMedicaid coverage loss due to OBBBA will decrease access to mental health and substance treatment among US adults and children; reduce Medicaid mental health and substance use benefits for those who remain covered; and worsen behavioral health workforce shortages. While OBBBA’s Medicaid provisions primarily target adults, the Act will spill over to negatively impact children: when parents gain or lose Medicaid coverage, their children often do the same.3,4 In addition, the Act’s federal funding cuts will require states to save money by cutting optional eligibility and benefit categories, many of which pertain to children.\n\nOBBBA’s work and redetermination requirements for adults covered by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion of Medicaid will cause coverage loss, often due to paperwork red-tape reasons as opposed to actual ineligibility. OBBBA requires adults to work at least 80 hours per month and mandates that eligibility be re-determined every 6 months, double the frequency of the current standard of 12 months. Most Medicaid-covered adults are employed, and the large majority of those not employed have an illness, disability, or caregiving responsibilities that render them exempt from Medicaid work requirements. However, paperwork barriers to repeatedly verifying employment or exempt status lead eligible adults to fall off the rolls. Arkansas’ 2018-2019 Medicaid work requirements led to significant coverage loss without increasing employment.5,6 OBBBA attempts to mitigate paperwork barriers by requiring states to verify eligibility using existing administrative data sources—potentially utilizing artificial intelligence techniques—but major impediments will likely persist due to limited available data and inadequate health information technology. Variation in data infrastructure across states will create disparities in the volume of paperwork-related disenrollments across states, as occurred during the post COVID-19 Medicaid unwinding. In addition to causing coverage loss via work and eligibility redetermination requirements, OBBBA renders many lawful immigrants who were previously eligible for Medicaid ineligible, including refugees, asylum recipients, people on humanitarian parole, and those on visas related to human trafficking or violent victimization.\n\nAs noted above, parent and child Medicaid coverage are linked. In the first wave of states expanding Medicaid coverage to low-income adults via the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2014, over 700,000 eligible but previously unenrolled children gained Medicaid coverage due to parents’ increased awareness of and familiarity with the program.3 OBBBA’s cuts to parental coverage due to the work and redetermination requirements will reverse this “welcome mat” effect. Over 10 million adults and children are estimated to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034.\n\nAnother major OBBBA Medicaid provision prohibits new provider taxes, which states have historically used to fund their share of Medicaid spending, and requires some states that expanded Medicaid through the ACA to reduce current provider tax rates. These limits will force difficult state decisions about which optional eligibility categories, optional benefits, or provider payments to curtail in the face of smaller state Medicaid budgets. Regardless of the choices made, negative impacts for people with mental illness or substance use disorder are probable. Optional eligibility categories not required by federal law include “medically needy” children with high health care needs and costs and children with disabilities; nearly 60% of the children in these groups have behavioral health needs. Optional benefits include a range of behavioral health services covered through waivers, including Section 1115 waivers for substance use disorder care used by 36 states and the District of Columbia to cover medications for opioid use disorder, intensive outpatient services, residential care, and recovery support services, among others. Section 1915c home- and community-based services (HCBS) waivers that allow people who would otherwise need institutional care to live in the community and receive home care, transportation, and skills training, are also likely targets for cuts. Nine percent of children and 31% of adults who use HCBS have mental illness.\n\nThe OBBBA Medicaid provision will also substantially worsen the behavioral health workforce deficit. As of 2022, only one mental health care provider was available per 350 people in the United States, with more than 152 million people living in a “mental health workforce shortage area.” Behavioral health workforce deficits limit access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries and others with mental illness or substance use disorder. Behavioral health providers are among the lowest paid clinician specialties, an issue exacerbated by the fact that Medicaid, which reimburses providers at lower rates than Medicare or commercial insurance, is the largest payer of mental health and substance use disorder services.7 These issues disincentivize clinicians from choosing behavioral health as a specialty and, among those who do enter the field, limit the number of Medicaid patients they treat.8 OBBBA will likely worsen these issues, as newly limited state budgets may preclude increases—or even prompt decreases—in behavioral health provider payments. In addition, OBBBA limits the amount that state Medicaid managed care contracts can direct plans to pay providers—a mechanism called “state directed payments”—to Medicare (rather than higher commercial) levels. Behavioral health providers have been a common target of state directed payments, with some states, prior to OBBBA, directing that some types of behavioral health clinicians be paid on par with commercial rates.23 This provision will disappear under OBBBA, contributing to lower Medicaid payments to behavioral health providers.\n\nThe nation faces an ongoing behavioral health crisis. Undertreatment of mental illness and substance use disorder has far-reaching negative impacts, not only on health and well-being but also on educational attainment, employment, and military readiness, among others.9-11 Yet, substantial evidence indicates that increasing Medicaid coverage is an effective tool to increase access to behavioral health treatment services and save lives. The ACA Medicaid expansion has been associated with increased mental illness treatment rates and fewer poor mental health days;12 increased use of medications for opioid use disorder;13,14 and reduced opioid-related hospital use15 and drug overdose.16,17 Evidence also supports positive spillovers of the ACA Medicaid expansion to children, including improved mental health18 and reduced child maltreatment,19,20 credited to the improvements in parents’ behavioral health outcomes and financial circumstances conferred by their new Medicaid coverage.21\n\nBy substantially reducing Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid coverage of health services, and the behavioral health workforce, we expect OBBBA’s Medicaid cuts to exacerbate challenges and reverse hard-won improvements in treatment access and health outcomes driven by the ACA Medicaid expansion. For the first time in more than 20 years, overdose deaths began to meaningfully decline in 2023. A recent analysis projects that OBBBA will cause 156,000 people to lose access to medication for opioid use disorder, resulting in over 1,000 excess fatal overdoses each year.\n\nIn the short-term, states should prioritize value-based and cost-effective strategies to manage behavioral health needs among Medicaid enrollees within the constraints of the OBBBA. Cityblock’s Advanced Behavioral Health Program, where specialized community health workers help people access highly effective treatments, is one promising model.22 Policy often swings on a pendulum, and the future will present opportunities to strengthen Medicaid, which the large majority of Americans view positively. In the meantime, it is imperative to develop evidence-driven coverage, benefit, and payment designs that go beyond overturning OBBBA’s cuts to optimize Medicaid to address the nation’s behavioral health.\n\nEditor’s Note: Drs.

Medical and rehabilitation services are provided to both Georgian and international injured military personnel and their family members who require and outpatient physical and psychological rehabilitation courses.\n\nNita Tchabashvili, head of the Psychology Support Division, expanded on rehabilitation treatment process and described how the services went beyond physical rehabilitation.\n\n“We evaluate wounded warriors and provide long-term treatment plans,” Tchabashvili said. “First, we evaluate the physical and psychological condition, and then we plan treatment and see what kind of services they need. We are not only working physical condition, but also mental health conditions and social issues. This facility give us a good opportunity to develop our rehabilitation services, and we want to offer our services to every military member.”\n\nStaff members offered comprehensive tours throughout the facility. The touring parties previewed the facility’s amenities, such as the art and recreational therapy spaces, physical rehabilitation and aqua therapy rooms, and the adapted sports area.\n\n“The civilian support for military personnel speaks volumes for the long-term partnerships established within this facility,” said U.S. Army Maj. Justin Zimmerman, physical therapist with 4th Security Force Assistance Brigade. “You can see true team cooperation and dedication to getting every patient back to top performance. When partner nations apply these same principles to the care they provide, warfighters from all nations can be confident that they are receiving the best care possible regardless of location.”\n\nThe multinational tour met with several Ukrainian soldiers and their families who completed the 10-day rehabilitation course. One Ukrainian family presented a plaque, featuring the words ‘Cлава Yкраїні’ (glory to Ukraine), to U.S. visitors.\n\n“It is difficult to adequately express how proud it made me to see peoples and governments banding together in a time of need,” said U.S. Army Maj. Cordell Hachinsky, physician with 4th SFAB. “You can read about the incredible things so many of our allies and partners are doing to support the brave Ukrainian Soldiers and families, but seeing it in real-life was truly humbling.”\n\nInteroperability is more than just equipment and systems – it is about processes and relationships as well.

The new hospital will be smaller, about 316,000 square feet, than the current 650,000-square-foot hospital complex.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGov. Kelly Armstrong said the new hospital reflects the state’s focus on modernizing important public services, like mental health and addiction services.\n\n“I will be the happiest governor in the world if those 19 beds are eventually sitting empty,” Armstrong said to the standing room only crowd at the groundbreaking ceremony. “Because that will mean we’ve successfully served people upstream, well before their cases become so acute that they require an institutional setting.”\n\nHe said the new facility will be “safe and secure” not only for the patients, but the staff that serves them.\n\nGov.

Dickerson, who worked to improve conditions for the poor.\n\nEventually, the Eloise grounds became entirely self-sufficient, and operated like an independent town with 75 buildings on 902 acres which included fire and police departments, a post office, power plant, bakery, a fully-functioning farm, and even a railroad and trolley system.\n\nPhoto credit JOHN HEIDER | hometownlife.com via Imagn Content Services, LLC\n\nA teaching hospital for students of Wayne State University and the University of Michigan, Eloise was considered to be at the cutting edge of new medical technology, and was one of the first facilities in the country to utilize x-ray machines, as well as music and art therapy.\n\nDespite its forward-thinking, Eloise also practiced now-controversial methods such as lobotomies, hydrotherapy and insulin therapy on some of its patients, and also drew criticism for overcrowding and sometimes poor conditions due to a lack of funding from the state.\n\nAfter ballooning to an estimated 10,000 residents during the Great Depression, population began to decline over the next four decades as funding for mental health wained, and the Eloise Psychiatric Hospital shuttered in 1979.\n\nWayne County General Hospital remained operational on the grounds for several more years before also closing its doors in 1986.\n\nIn the years that followed, parts of the Eloise grounds were sold off, and turned into strip malls, condos and a golf course.\n\nThe most well-known remaining structure is the Kay Beard Building, which once served as the Eloise admission and post offices, but also housed about 400 patients and staff living quarters.\n\nPhoto credit Annie Scaramuzzino/WWJ\n\nWayne County used the structure for administration purposes until 2016, and the building and other remaining Eloise property was later sold to a developer for $1.\n\nA portion of the Kay Beard Building has now been turned into the Eloise Asylum haunted attraction.\n\nThe Eloise site has long been a hot spot for paranormal investigators and urban explorers, and ghost tours of the upper floors continue to be offered to the public.\n\nStill, some have taken issue with the haunted house, believing it to be insensitive to the patients who once lived there.\n\nMany local groups, including the Friends of Eloise, have spent years working to preserve the history of the facility, including the ongoing efforts to identify several thousand patients who were discovered in a nearby burial ground.\n\nMeanwhile, those who run the haunted attraction argue that they too are preserving the building by making it operational, and say they work to ensure that they never depict “real-life” events in their theatrics.\n\nPhoto credit JOHN HEIDER/hometownlife.com via Imagn Content Services, LLC\n\nJust as mixed are the feelings about whether or not Eloise is actually haunted, with many insisting they have had paranormal encounters, while other say they have spent years on the grounds and have never witnessed anything unusual.\n\nThe one thing that holds true is that Eloise has been cemented into the history of Metro Detroit, and will continue to hold different meanings for different people.\n\nWhether you believe there’s something more spiritual residing somewhere on those expansive grounds in Westland…well, that’s entirely up to you.\n\nListen to the latest episode of The Daily J’s Spooky series, and check out our features on the hauntings of Mackinac Island, Detroit's Two Way Inn and The Whitney.", "source_domain": "www.audacy.com"}
{"url": "https://thecurrentla.com/2025/new-immigrant-tracking-laws-take-effect-in-louisiana/?utm_medium=rss", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Two new Louisiana laws that require some state agencies and higher education systems to collect and share data on undocumented migrants are now in effect – including reporting some applicants for benefits to federal immigration authorities. The enactment of the laws follow moves at the federal level to expand data-collection on applicants for government benefits.\n\nIt’s not yet clear when all affected state agencies will begin collecting the information — or how they plan to do it — the new data-collection requirements are raising concerns that immigrant families will be too scared to apply for public benefits, even when they are eligible.\n\nAct 419 — sponsored by Sen. Blake Miguez — R-New Iberia requires service-providing public agencies, including the state Department of Education, Department of Corrections and the Department of Children & Family Services – and all public higher education institutions, to collect data on the immigration status of people who receive those services and report to the state and the public on the cost of undocumented immigrants to those agencies and institutions.\n\nAct 351 — sponsored by Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley — requires state agencies that provide public assistance, such as food stamps or Medicaid, to collect and report the personal information of people who apply for benefits, and are found ineligible, to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAct 419 took effect in late June. Act 351 became effective at the beginning of this month.\n\nPrior to the passage of the laws, undocumented immigrants were already barred from receiving many public benefits, such as Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps. But immigrant parents, regardless of status, can apply for those benefits for their U.S. citizen children. However, as the heads of household, those parents must include information about themselves, including their immigration statuses and earnings.\n\n“The most difficult [situation] for an immigrant is when you go to an agency to seek services, not for ourselves, but our U.S. citizen children. We are the head of the family, so they have all of our information,” said one Metairie mother, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras whose son is a U.S. citizen. “From the moment they have our addresses, the fear starts to grow.” (She asked that her name not be published because she fears she will be targeted by U.S. immigration authorities if she were to be identified.)\n\nHer school-aged son receives both SNAP and Medicaid. Speaking through an interpreter, the woman said he has complications with his heart that require him to be seen by a cardiologist every six months. She said she was relieved when his Medicaid benefits were automatically renewed in June.\n\nIf her son were to lose his health insurance, “it would be a massive impact, especially since we’re immigrants and we can’t get other public benefits,” she said.\n\n“From the moment they have our addresses, the fear starts to grow,” said the undocumented Metairie mother, pictured August 18, 2025, about the state’s new immigration laws. Credit: Christiana Botic / Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America\n\nThe legislation is in line with a broadera conservative push, at both the state and federal levels, to crackdown on undocumented immigrants, who conservatives describe as being a financial drain on the country’s public services, including education and healthcare.\n\nIn late July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture began gathering state level data on SNAP recipients and applicants dating back to January 1, 2020. The data requested includes information about members of the recipients’ households, including social security numbers – which undocumented immigrants can’t obtain. Earlier that month, the Trump Administration secured an information sharing agreement between the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, granting ICE access to millions of Medicaid recipients’ records to aid in the agency’s efforts to locate immigrants.\n\nAct 419 — the bill that requires agencies to track benefit applicants — is essentially a replica of an executive order Gov. Jeff Landry, an immigration hardliner and Trump ally, issued last year near the beginning of his term. That order not only targets benefits that undocumented immigrants are barred from accessing but state services that have long been universally available, regardless of status, such as a free K-12 public education.\n\nJulie Norman, a social worker and co-founder of Girasol, a nonprofit that provides legal and social work services to immigrant families, said she feels like the new federal and state reporting efforts are meant to scare immigrant families, including ones with members who are U.S. citizens, so that they don’t access resources that are available to them.\n\n“My fear is that so much of this is to terrify people into hiding, and to like create an environment in which a lot of immigrants don’t feel they can send their kids to school [or] don’t get food stamps or Medicaid for their U.S. citizen children, and yet are still being relied upon for their labor and to keep the economy going,” Norman said.\n\nLandry’s office did not respond to requests for comment on this story, nor did Miguez or Henry, the bills’ sponsors in the legislature.\n\nImplementation\n\nIt appears to be unclear how some state agencies will implement mandates of the new laws. Act 419 applies to several agencies, including the Departments of Health, Education, Children and Family Services and Corrections.\n\nA provision in Act 419 states that “implementation … shall be subject to the appropriation of funds by the legislature.” The state budget for this year does not include specific earmarks for implementation of the bills, but that would not necessarily be required if the agencies have enough money in their budgets to follow the new laws.\n\nA representative from the Department of Health did not respond to multiple requests for clarity on how the new laws would be implemented in that agency.\n\nIn an email, Amy Whitehead, a representative for the Department of Children and Family Services, which administers SNAP, said the agency will meet the requirements of the new laws. However, Whitehead did not elaborate on how those requirements would be implemented, despite being asked.\n\nAs for state colleges and universities, Ryleigh Kühn, communications specialist at the Louisiana Board of Regents, said the board spoke with schools about Act 419’s requirements “during the legislative process,” but did not provide any information on implementation.\n\nChandler LeBoeuf, vice president of education for the Louisiana Community and Technical College System, said the school system is “working to comply with the provisions” of the new law.\n\n“As with any newly enacted legislation, we are reviewing internal systems and coordinating closely with the appropriate agencies to ensure full alignment and adherence to the law,” LeBoeuf said in an emailed statement.\n\nPrimary and secondary education remains a question.\n\nIn a July email, Department of Education spokesman Ted Beasley said the department is “still in the process of making final determinations on [the bills’] anticipated impact.” Beasley has neither provided an update, nor responded to requests regarding how data will be collected for K-12 students.\n\nIndividual students’ citizenship or immigration information is protected from disclosure under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. However, schools report aggregate data about their student population to the U.S. Department of Education, schools already must share aggregate data, including information about immigration statuses, with the federal government to meet certain funding requirements.\n\nIdentifying and reporting undocumented public school students appeared to be a priority to Landry in his 2024 executive order.\n\n“Congressional reporting estimates that at least 3.8 million illegal alien children at primary and secondary schools in the United States qualify as Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students, costing American taxpayers nearly $59 billion,” the order reads. “Those illegal alien children who entered in 2022 alone represent a $7 billion burden on public education budgets. Louisiana spends more than $10,000 per student at public primary and secondary schools.\n\nIn 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Plyler v. Doe that states can’t deny free public education to undocumented children. But at least one prominent conservative group hopes that tracking laws, like Act 419 in Louisiana, will lead to that decision being overturned.\n\nA February 2024 brief issued by the Heritage Foundation — the think tank behind Project 2025 — recommended that states “require school districts to collect enrollment data by immigration status as part of their regular enrollment counts” to better calculate the costs associated with educating undocumented students. and to make the data public.\n\n“Such legislation would draw a lawsuit from the Left, which would likely lead the Supreme Court to reconsider its ill-considered Plyler v. Doe decision that had no basis in law,” the Heritage Foundation brief said.\n\nA representative from the Heritage Foundation declined to comment on the new state laws.\n\n“From the moment they have our addresses, the fear starts to grow,” the Metairie woman said. Credit: Christiana Botic / Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America\n\nImmigrant fears\n\nThe undocumented Metairie mother said she felt comfortable applying for benefits for her son when President Joe Biden was in office. She applied to renew his SNAP benefits in January before Trump’s inauguration and he was approved.\n\nShe said she’s required to submit new documentation showing that his household’s circumstances remain unchanged, but she’s uncomfortable submitting the information now that SNAP officials can report directly to ICE under Act 351.\n\nShe said she’s concerned that agencies may not limit information-sharing to applicants, sharing undocumented members of mixed status households details as well.\n\nShe said she tries to encourage other immigrants she knows to stay calm and remind them of their rights, but as federal and state governments pressure on immigration intensifies, migrant families are stepping deeper into the shadows of society out of fear.\n\n“There are so many families that are confined and isolated. They only leave home to buy food,” she said. “It’s affecting our kids so much — being shut in like this — they don’t feel safe being out with their parents.”", "source_domain": "thecurrentla.com"}

The facility will be located near other OSF facilities, according to a news release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe to-be-built facility is estimated to open in either late 2024 or early 2025; the two organizations have begun the regulatory approval process. It will provide 24/7 access to comprehensive behavioral health services, including crisis services. It will also offer free assessments, specialized programming, partial hospitalization programs and intensive outpatient services.\n\n“Being able to bring in a large number of beds to central Illinois keeps people close to home and allows us to provide that continuity of care within the community that people reside and allows for family members to be much more involved in the care of their loved ones which we know is evidence based and compassionate,” Dr. Samuel Sears, director of behavioral health physician services, for OSF HealthCare, said in the release.\n\nThe company has already built three facilities near Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis JV is representative of US Health Vest’s larger strategy. US HealthVest is an investment company that focuses its de novo-heavy strategy on building and owning new psychiatric hospitals. It does so through joint ventures with local med-surg hospital organizations, Dr. Richard Kresch, CEO and President of US HealthVest told BHB.\n\nThe local joint venture runs the day-to-day operations largely under the management of the local hospital partner while US HealthVest provides an oversight role focused on psychiatric care.\n\nThe company also targets states with certificate of need (CON) laws. These regulations require new entrants to a market or incumbents seeking to make major investments (like building a facility) to disclose and, in some cases, gain approval from state regulators before doing so.\n\n“While the CON process adds to the development time, CONs provide strong competitive advantages including high barriers to entry,” Martina Sze, chief development officer for US HealthVest, said in an email. “The OSF HealthCare JV hospital requires a CON and we have started that process in Illinois where we have a strong track record of gaining approvals.”\n\nUS HealthVest hospitals presently encompass about 1,300 beds, Kresch said. The company has built three hospitals in Illinois, two each in Georgia and Washington, and one each in Indiana and Massachusetts.\n\nUS HealthVest also has a partnership with the hospital organizations Sturdy Memorial Hospital Inc., South Shore Health System Inc. and Signature Healthcare Corp. to build a psychiatric hospital in Southeastern Massachusetts. This project is just beginning, Kresch said.\n\nIn March 2021, US HealthVest and Hendricks Regional Health opened a 70,000-square-foot facility in Plainfield, Indiana — near Indianapolis. That is US HealthVest’s first facility in Indiana.\n\nThe big picture with psychiatric hospitals\n\nPsychiatric hospitals stand at a critical juncture of several titanic trends that make them prime spots for dealmaking and partnership.\n\nAt the broadest level, the diminishing supply of psychiatric beds on its own drives demand up and up. An increased focus on behavioral health due to the pandemic further accelerates the need on the demand side.\n\nDuring the pandemic, US HealthVest has seen an uptick in development opportunities, mostly on the joint venture side of the business due COVID-driven increases in demand for services, Sze said.\n\nThere are still deeper drivers behind the demand for new psychiatric hospitals, Kresch said.\n\nFor years, many medical-surgical hospital operators have been shutting down the psychiatric units to make room for other services, Kresch said, while many new facilities often don’t factor in psych units.\n\nThis has happened and is happening during a time when “the universe of people who would consider treatment in an acute psychiatric hospital has increased,” Kresch said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, passed and implemented during the Obama administration, he said, increased access to private health insurance and increased support for states to expand access to government-backed insurance plans, especially state-level-administered Medicaid. This gave more people more affordable access to health care in the first place.\n\nFurther, the stigma around seeking care has abated somewhat in recent years, he added.\n\n“The overall market dynamics are good in terms of the volume of patients exceeding the availability of beds for the most part,” Kresch said. “I think there is a recognition by governments at all levels that there’s a need and that that need needs to be supported with reasonable reimbursement.”\n\nAt a historical level, the decrease in psychiatric beds is a distant extension of a decades-long trend in inpatient psychiatric care.\n\nFor over 60 years state hospitals, previously well-accessed sources of long-term inpatient psychiatric services, have also been shutting down as part of a movement in health care policy called deinstitutionalization. The U.S. had more than 558,000 state psychiatric beds in 1955. The patient population supported by inpatient services dropped from about 370,000 to 40,000 between 1970 and 2014, according to an American Psychiatric Association report.\n\n“In some ways, it has been helpful to our acute psychiatric hospitals,” Kresch said. “In terms of the business side, volume and so on, it’s probably helpful to the acute sector because we are seeing patients in crisis mode who otherwise have been long-term patients in a state hospital.”\n\nLooking forward, the company’s near-term goal is to find and strike new deals while the long-term strategy will remain what it always has been for US HealthVest, Kresch said.\n\n“It’s more of the same — the development of new hospitals and opportunistic acquisition of operating hospitals if circumstances are correct,” Kresch said.", "source_domain": "bhbusiness.com"}
{"url": "https://www.theravive.com/today/post/new-study-looks-at-loneliness-and-its-impact-on-mental-and-physical-health-0005094.aspx", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "A new study published in PLOS One looked at the impact of loneliness on depression, mental health, and physical well-being.\n\n“Our study investigates how loneliness, measured as the subjective feeling of social disconnection, predicts poor mental and physical health outcomes,” study author Oluwasegun Akinyemi told us. “Specifically, we examined whether individuals who feel lonely more often are more likely to experience clinical depression, more frequent days of poor mental health, and more frequent days of poor physical health. Our goal was to estimate this relationship using rigorous statistical methods and a nationally representative dataset, in order to inform public health responses.”\n\nThe researchers hypothesized that higher levels of loneliness would be associated with significantly worse mental and physical health outcomes, particularly an increased likelihood of depression. They also suspected that these effects might vary across demographic lines such as age, race, and gender, based on prior evidence suggesting differences in the experience and consequences of loneliness.\n\n“Loneliness is often described as a silent epidemic,” Akinyemi told us. “It cuts across age, race, and social status, and yet it remains under-recognized in public health discourse. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, I observed how isolation took a toll on individuals' emotional and physical well-being. This study was born out of a desire to quantify that toll and to provide robust, population-level data that can help design targeted interventions.”\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 47,000 U.S. adults who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) between 2016 and 2023. Using a statistical technique called inverse probability weighting, the researchers estimated the average treatment effects of loneliness on health outcomes, adjusting for a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. This approach simulates a randomized design and helps strengthen the causal interpretation of the findings.\n\n“The results were striking,” Akinyemi told us. “People who reported always feeling lonely had a 50.2% likelihood of clinical depression, compared to just 9.7% among those who never felt lonely.”\n\nThe study also found an average of 10.9 more poor mental health days per month and about five additional poor physical health days each month.\n\nWhile this study sheds light on loneliness as a health risk, it also highlights resilience in some populations. For instance, Black and Hispanic individuals, despite reporting high loneliness levels, showed lower predicted probabilities of depression than White peers.\n\n“This points to cultural or social protective factors that should be better understood and possibly scaled,” Akinyemi told us. “I hope this work inspires deeper conversations and concrete actions around the mental and physical toll of loneliness in our society.”\n\nThe research team also found significant disparities. For example, women reported more poor mental health days than men, and older adults had more poor physical health days regardless of loneliness level.\n\n“While we anticipated a strong link between loneliness and depression, the magnitude of the association was surprising,” Akinyemi told us. “That over 50% of those who are always lonely report being clinically depressed is a deeply concerning statistic. It underscores that loneliness is not just an emotional experience, it has real, measurable health consequences.”\n\nThe implications are both urgent and actionable according to Akinyemi who believes loneliness should be screened for in primary care settings just like high blood pressure or cholesterol are screened.\n\n“Social prescribing, connecting individuals to community resources, support groups, or recreational activities, should become part of routine healthcare,” Akinyemi told us. “We also need public policies that promote social infrastructure, especially in underserved communities where loneliness may be compounded by other structural disadvantages.”", "source_domain": "www.theravive.com"}

Her work helped integrate health data between the VA and the Department of Defense—an essential step to understanding how TBI acquired during military service can impact health after someone leaves the military.\n\n“This linkage is invaluable because it allows us to analyze long-term health outcomes while incorporating crucial details from military service—such as injury characteristics and blast exposures—that are missing from VA data alone,” Pugh says.\n\n“This ‘gold mine’ of data has enabled rapid and critical surveillance of Military Occupational Blast Exposure (MOBE) from large weapons,” she adds, “which is vital because many service members with MOBE do not have a specific documented injury or diagnosis, which is essential to demonstrate service connection for disability claims.”\n\nPugh leads the Data and Biostatistics Core for a national research consortium called LIMBIC, a DoD- and VA-funded group that brings together nearly 40 organizations to study the chronic effects of brain trauma in a cohort of over 2.5 million people.\n\nTo spot new patterns within this data, Pugh uses a strategy called complexity theory. This method of data analysis allows her to disentangle the effects of concussion from other contributors to health, finding long-term health outcomes that other analyses don’t detect.\n\nMatthew Samore, MD, principal investigator of the IDEAS Center and the VA Consortium for Healthcare Informatics Research, says that Pugh’s research has had fundamental impacts. “Dr. Pugh’s contributions of foundational knowledge about the detrimental effects of blast exposure have been instrumental in shaping policy and response,” says Samore, who also serves as division chief of epidemiology at U of U Health.\n\n“I am incredibly proud of our work,” Pugh adds. “This award validates the exceptional work of my team over the past 20 years.”", "source_domain": "uofuhealth.utah.edu"}

However, critics argue that taxpayers were often left footing huge bills for contracts that were inflexible and ran for as long as 30 years.\n\nFull cost of federated data platform to exceed £1 billion\n\nThe full cost of the national federated data platform (FDP) programme is set to exceed £1 billion over its first seven years, the Health Service Journal has revealed.\n\nThe full business case for the FDP, which has never been made public, estimated the whole-life cost of the programme to be £1.04 billion over its seven-year lifespan, according to the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority’s latest annual report.\n\nIn 2023, NHS England pledged to publish the full business case once the contract for the FDP was awarded, but it later backtracked on this pledge. Instead, it published a heavily redacted version of the contract it awarded to US supplier Palantir, a decision that has attracted controversy due to the supplier’s links to the defence industry.\n\nPreviously, the cost of the FDP has been quoted as £330 million, but this is just the value of the contract awarded to Palantir and its consortium partners to provide the platform itself.\n\nAccording to NHSE, the remaining £670 million has been allocated to ‘support the broader transformation work both locally and nationally that use of the NHS FDP will enable’, such as ‘business change activities’ to support the use of theatre utilisation or discharge tools.\n\nNHS marks major milestone with 100,000 people home tested for hepatitis C\n\nMore than 100,000 people in England have now been tested for hepatitis C through the NHS’s confidential home testing service, in a major milestone towards eliminating the virus as a public health threat.\n\nEngland is one of the few countries in the world on track to eliminate hepatitis C well before the World Health Organization’s 2030 target.\n\nLatest data shows that 105,998 people have ordered an at-home NHS hepatitis C test, since the portal launched in May 2023.\n\nAround 225 people have been saved from the deadly virus thanks to NHS treatment, after testing positive through the scheme.\n\nMore weight-loss drugs could be offered as part of new diabetes care\n\nTreatment for millions of people with type 2 diabetes should be more personalised, with greater access to newer medicines including weight-loss drugs, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said.\n\nNICE, the healthcare assessment body for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, called the move ‘the biggest shake-up’ in type 2 diabetes care in a decade, and said that offering more people the new drugs will prevent complications such as heart disease, strokes and kidney damage, reduce costs to the NHS and potentially save lives.\n\nAround 4.6 million people in the UK are diagnosed with diabetes – of these 90 per cent have type 2, where there is too much glucose or sugar in the blood, while another 1.3 million people are likely to be undiagnosed.\n\nNHS Confederation comments on mental health briefing\n\nA new briefing highlighting challenges facing crisis and inpatient mental health services in England has been published by the Centre for Mental Health.\n\nResponding to the briefing, Rebecca Gray, the NHS Confederation’s mental health director, said that it ‘shines a welcome light on the challenges currently facing crisis and inpatient mental health services and support.’\n\nShe added: “All parts of the system – including ICBs as strategic commissioners, providers in mental health, ambulance and acute services – must work together to support the development and expansion of the most effective, evidence-based pathways for crisis support, including voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) provision.”\n\nWelsh NHS Confederation responds to Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care’s cancer care update\n\nA written update on cancer care in Wales has been provided by Jeremy Miles MS, Cabinet Secretary Health and Social Care.\n\nIt follows a written statement in June which set out how Wales will introduce a national lung screening programme targeted at those people who are at greatest risk of developing lung cancer. Today’s update states, among other things, that work on establishing this programme has started and that it is expected to cost around £13 million per annum once fully implemented.\n\nDirector of the Welsh NHS Confederation Darren Hughes welcomed the clarity on plans and next steps to improve cancer care in Wales.\n\nHe said: “Exceptional cancer care is delivered every day in Wales, but NHS leaders are committed to doing more, as they know how important it is to get this right.

(DTN/Progressive Farmer photo by Joel Reichenberger)\n\nMental health isn't an easy topic to talk about, no matter where you live. It can be especially difficult in rural areas because of the stigma surrounding it. Yet, it's a critical issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nFarmers and ranchers face unique challenges beyond their control, causing significant stress that can lead to anxiety, depression and other mental health issues. Extreme weather events can damage or wipe out entire crops, and injure or kill livestock. Crop and livestock prices can fall to levels that don't cover the cost of production. Government regulations can add extra costs and paperwork to the business. Input costs can skyrocket, eroding hard-earned revenue.\n\nRural culture teaches us to tough it out during these trying times and to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps. That attitude can serve us well when it comes to tackling the daily tasks associated with farming and ranching. But, when it comes to our mental health, and our overall health for that matter, going it alone can have disastrous -- even fatal -- consequences.\n\nWe hope the stories and resources on this page provide you with useful information on how to maintain your mental wellness through challenging times, recognize when something is wrong and find the appropriate help when needed. We also hope it helps spur an open, shame-free conversation among farmers, ranchers and their families about this important topic.\n\nMental Health Terms to Know\n\nThere are many terms associated with mental health and the services out there that exist to help -- but what do they mean? Understanding these terms and resources is crucial for promoting mental health awareness, reducing stigma, and facilitating access to appropriate mental health services and support.\n\nClick here for an explanation of some of these important mental health terms: https://www.dtnpf.com/…\n\nList of Mental Health Resources\n\nIf you're facing a crisis on your farm or ranch or struggling to cope with the emotional pressures of business, family or some difficult life situation, you're not alone. Help is just a phone call, text or online chat away. In this list of resources, you can find emergency contact information for those who may be having thoughts of suicide or are facing a mental health crisis, national groups and organizations that can provide support and treatment referrals for mental health issues and addiction, and mental health support services for youth. There are also links to other sites where you can search for mental health services in your own state.\n\nClick here for the list of rural mental health resources: https://www.dtnpf.com/…\n\n**\n\nProgressive Farmer Special Issue on Rural Mental Health\n\nProgressive Farmer devoted its May 2024 issue to helping farmers, ranchers and their families manage their mental wellness when dealing with the unique challenges of farming and ranching. In this issue, you'll find stories examining the unique mental health challenges that people in rural areas face, advice on recognizing the warning signs of mental distress and how to get professional help, as well as personal stories from farmers who have struggled with and overcome mental health challenges.\n\n-- We'd Like To Mention: \"It's Time to End the Stigma Surrounding Rural Mental Health\"\n\nhttps://www.dtnpf.com/…\n\nStaying silent on mental health issues can have devastating consequences.

Technical Standards — Standards need to be created for the project. Standards help maintain production quality, reduce costs, ensure interoperability, simplify interfaces with other components, maximize longevity and encourage suppliers to enter the high-speed rail market. Links to Universities and Industries — Universities and industries can help boost training opportunities to help plan, design and deliver high-speed rail. Project Management, Procurement and Risk — Project sponsors need to invest in internal capacity to develop well-defined projects, manage consultants and contractors and coordinate across multiple manageably sized contract packages. Permitting, Third Party Agreements and Planning — Projects need billions of dollars in grant funding to successfully be completed.\n\nAccording to the report, there are two main themes found in helping to accelerate high-speed rail projects:\n\nScale: Administrative and geographical focus Management: The entity leading the project\n\nThe report examines three current high-speed rail projects that could be sped up with the recommendations outlined:\n\nIn the report, Goldwyn notes that with all the funding the federal government issues for these types of projects, there needs to be terms and conditions to ensure the money is spent legally and that time commitments are met to speed up local permitting. Goldwyn notes one element contributing to delays in a project is paying contractors who cannot perform work due to waiting for approval from the federal government. Goldwyn says this over emphasizes environmental review. He recommends separating the planning process from the environmental review process to refocus the emphasis on designing the best project and figuring out the biggest challenges of these projects.\n\nThe full report can be viewed here. Goldwyn is working on a second high-speed rail report that relates to the Northeast Corridor.

The Company is focused on acquiring uncapped royalties and streams over producing, or near-producing, mines operated by established counterparties. The vision of Elemental Altus is to build a global gold royalty company, offering investors superior exposure to gold with reduced risk and a strong growth profile.\n\nQualified Person\n\nRichard Evans, FAusIMM, is Senior Vice President Technical for Elemental Altus, and a qualified person under National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this press release.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Non-IFRS Measures\n\nThe Company has included certain performance measures which are non-IFRS and are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS measures do not have any standard meaning under IFRS and other companies may calculate measures differently.\n\nRoyalty revenue is received at zero cost. Distributions from associates related to Elemental Altus’ effective royalty on Caserones are received net of Chilean taxes and have no other costs.\n\nAdjusted Revenue and cash flow from operating activities\n\nAdjusted revenue is a non-IFRS financial measure, which is defined as including gross royalty revenue from associated entities holding royalty interests related to Elemental Altus’ effective royalty on the Caserones copper mine. Management uses adjusted revenue to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company for the reporting periods presented, to assist with the planning and forecasting of future operating results, and to supplement information in its financial statements. Management believes that in addition to measures prepared in accordance with IFRS such as revenue, investors may use adjusted revenue to evaluate the results of the underlying business, particularly as the adjusted revenue may not typically be included in operating results. Management believes that adjusted revenue is a useful measure of the Company performance because it adjusts for items which management believes reflect the Company’s core operating results from period to period. Adjusted revenue is intended to provide additional information to investors and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. It does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\n\nAdjusted depletion, adjusted tax expense and adjusted cash flow from operating activities are non-IFRS measures which include depletion, tax and dividends from the Caserones royalty asset in line with the recognition of adjusted revenue as described above.\n\nGold Equivalent Ounces\n\nElemental Altus’ adjusted royalty, streaming, and other revenue is converted to an attributable gold equivalent ounce, or GEO, basis by dividing the royalty and other revenue from associates in a period by the average gold price for the same respective period, plus the net gold ounces received in the period from streaming investments. The presentation of this non-IFRS measure is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently. The production forecast was derived using information that is available in the public domain as at the date hereof, which included guidance and estimates prepared and issued by management of the operators of the mining operations in which Elemental Altus holds an interest. The production forecast is sensitive to the performance and operating status of the underlying mines. None of the information has been independently verified by Elemental Altus and may be subject to uncertainty. There can be no assurance that such information is complete or accurate.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes the effects of certain other income/expenses and unusual non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of earnings before interest, taxes, depletion, including depletion and taxes relating to share of profit from associate, and share-based compensation. Management believes that this is a useful measure of the Company’s performance because it adjusts for items which may not relate to underlying operating performance of the Company and/or are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\n\nOn behalf of Elemental Altus Royalties Corp.\n\nNeither the TSX-V nor its Regulation Service Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX-V.) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this press release.\n\nCautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\n\nThis news release contains certain “forward looking statements” and certain “forward-looking information” as defined under applicable Canadian securities laws.

Rosen addressed her concerns on the so-called Big Beautiful Bill at the Northern Nevada HOPES — the bill could kick more than 100,000 Nevadans off of their health care and cut more than $500 million in funding from Medicaid to hospitals in the state.

She also says Medicaid helps those who are not recipients of the program by providing funding for hospitals in the state. She spoke today at Northern Nevada HOPES to highlight how HOPES and those who rely on their services would be hurt by the cuts in the bill, which she says was pushed through by Washington lawmakers who wanted to give tax breaks to billionaires. ‘People who need it the least are getting more money on the backs of the most vulnerable in our communities, and so Nevadans get less while the ultra-wealthy in this country get more.’ She says she will keep fighting to restore Medicaid funding.”\n\nKTVN Reno: Rosen Visits Northern Nevada HOPES To Speak Against Medicaid Cuts\n\nAnchor: “U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen made a visit to Northern Nevada HOPES to talk with health care providers. The senator says cuts in the president’s budget bill will affect Medicaid in Nevada. ‘If you have kidney problems and you’re not on your medication and you end up getting dialysis in an emergency room and they send you back out instead of keeping you on that less expensive medicine.’ Senator Rosen says the budget law will cut half a billion dollars in Medicaid funding for hospitals in the state.”\n\nKRXI Reno: In Reno, Rosen Opposes GOP Medicaid Cuts\n\nAnchor: “Senator Jacky Rosen hosted a press conference at the Northern Nevada HOPES Clinic.

If everybody seems to think this is a problem, like this is a consistent theme that everybody says, ‘Oh, it’s mental health that’s causing this...’ Then, what are we doing about it? The fact is, right now, we’re not doing anything about it.”\n\nPaul Nestadt, the Medical Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention, says meaningful steps to reduce gun suicide exist on individual, community, and legislative levels.\n\n“Things that remove access to a firearm, that put a little bit of time and space between a potentially suicidal person and the means to die by suicide, are lifesaving,” says Nestadt.\n\nExtreme Risk Protection Order laws, more commonly known as “red flag laws,” let law enforcement or families ask a court to temporarily take away a person’s guns if they pose a clear risk of violence to themselves or others.\n\nIowa doesn’t have a red flag law, but Kennedy says it needs to be considered.\n\n“I think there should be a way to remove those until that person can be deemed to be stable enough to have them,” says Kennedy.\n\nNestadt says passing a red flag law is one method to reducing gun suicides, but notes it also takes practices on an individual or community level, such as having a safe, secure place to store a gun and ensuring there’s access to mental health resources.\n\nOne simple, direct way for anyone who fears for a loved one’s mental health and their safety, is to ask them if they feel safe with a gun in the house or ask if they are having suicidal thoughts.\n\n“Even if they’re not honest with you, even if they don’t feel like they want to share those thoughts right now, what you’ve done by asking is you’ve open the door and you’ve told them in a way, ‘I’m someone you can come to when you do feel like talking about that,’” says Nestadt.\n\nNestadt says if you or someone you know is in a crisis, help is always available. Calling or texting the National Crisis Lifeline at 988 connects callers to someone locally who can offer support.\n\nCopyright 2025 KCRG. All rights reserved.", "source_domain": "www.kcrg.com"}

Attorney General Keith Ellison announced the action on Tuesday, stressing that the case is not about free speech but about the company's manipulation and failure to protect users.\n\n“This is about deception, manipulation, and misrepresentation,” Ellison said. “TikTok knows the dangers of its product but has failed to act responsibly or inform users of the risks.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiled in state court, the lawsuit claims TikTok violated Minnesota’s consumer protection and deceptive trade practice laws. The move follows a wave of similar lawsuits across the United States, with more than 20 states already challenging TikTok’s impact on children’s mental health.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the case stems from a nationwide probe launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general. Ellison said Minnesota delayed filing until it completed its own investigation.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial penalties of up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child accessed TikTok, along with a permanent injunction against harmful practices.\n\nDuring the announcement, middle school health teacher Sean Padden highlighted the app’s effect in classrooms, linking TikTok use to a surge in depression, anxiety, anger, low self-esteem, and shorter attention spans among students. “There’s a clear correlation between TikTok consumption and mental health struggles,” Padden noted.\n\nTIK TOK DENIES ALLEGATIONS\n\nTikTok has rejected Minnesota’s claims. Spokesperson Nathaniel Brown argued that the lawsuit misrepresents the platform’s safety measures. “Teen accounts include over 50 features and settings to safeguard users, including parental controls through our Family Pairing tool,” Brown said.\n\n- Ends\n\nWith inputs from Associated Press\n\nPublished By: Rivanshi Rakhrai Published On: Aug 20, 2025", "source_domain": "www.indiatoday.in"}

{"url": "https://concentratemedia.com/meeting-rural-michiganders-mental-health-care-needs/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nMichigan’s rural residents face different challenges when accessing mental health care. Transportation issues, loneliness, and limited group therapy options can compound mental health needs. To address these challenges, community mental health (CMH) agencies like Sanilac County Community Mental Health innovate community-based solutions that meet their populations where they’re at.\n\nMI Mental Health spoke with Will Morris, CEO, Sanilac County CMH, about how he and his staff tailor services to meet their communities’ needs. This interview has been condensed for length and clarity.\n\nQ. Do the mental health care needs of Michigan’s rural residents differ from those of urban residents?\n\nA. The answer to that is yes and no. No in the regards that everybody’s specific mental health needs are very individualized, based on each person’s own lived experiences and symptomology. There are a lot of similarities in both urban and rural settings as far as diagnoses, trauma, and those kinds of things. The needs are different in rural areas because transportation is a much larger issue. Loneliness is a much larger issue.\n\nIf we were in Detroit, Grand Rapids, or Lansing, and we wanted to do a support group for people who have lost loved ones, we would probably have dozens of people interested. In a rural area, you might get one dozen people who are interested, but each one is available at a different day and time or in different corners of the county. So you can’t get more than one or two people together. Because groups are much harder to run, services, in general, are more individualized.\n\nWe probably do a significantly higher volume of community-based care home visits than other areas do. And we have a harder time doing social recreational activities and providing in-home help because it’s harder to find enough employees willing to do that kind of travel for the salaries that we’re able to pay for those positions.\n\n​​There are certain regulatory restrictions that make it really hard for rural communities. We are a CCBHC [certified community behavioral health clinic]. CCBHCs are required to have mobile crisis teams and crisis service after hours. When we read the application, I thought, “That’s not cost-effective to do a team like they do in the city.” They might not get called out once in an eight-hour shift. So, we do an after-hours on-call system. Two staff are there so when a call happens, they can go out. It’s much more cost-effective and allows us to tailor services to the needs of our community.\n\nSanilac County CMH is very involved in community events, partnerships, and programming, even the annual Santa Claus parade.\n\nQ. What strategies or programs have you developed to address the challenges of delivering rural care?\n\nA. We distributed iPads to all of our law enforcement and first responders across the county. When there’s an individual with behavioral health concerns, they can divert them when appropriate, assessing them for hospitalization or for other types of treatment services.\n\nBeing very rural, Sanilac County doesn’t have the best high-speed internet. In a lot of communities, they use video technology so people can see their therapist from home. We created video rooms, so our citizens could come into the building and see their psychiatrist here. They also get face-to-face contact with a CMH staff person that can make sure that their needs are met.\n\nQ. Sanilac County CMH is very involved in community events, partnerships, and programming. How does that help deliver care to more of your rural residents?\n\nA. In rural communities, historically, stigma related to mental health and substance use disorder issues is a lot higher than in urban communities. So the more involved I am and the more involved my agency is, the more we can get people to understand that we’re here to support the community in general — not a specific subset, not a specific person, but the community.\n\nBuilding culture in the communities is so important. When I got this position, I moved to the county. I’m actually on the Village Council of the village I live in. I’m very active in our local community. My wife’s on the Arts Council and does lots of work with the library. We immersed ourselves in the community so we could hear what the community was saying, so that we can adjust the agency’s presence to meet those needs when they come up.\n\nSanilac County CMH is part of the community. We step up whenever it’s necessary. We have lots of community partners. If I picked up the phone right now and said we needed something, someone would come through for us because they know they could call us, and we would do the same.\n\nLike all Michigan community mental health agencies, Sanilac County CMH cares for residents of all ages.\n\nQ. What else is important to consider when delivering mental health services in rural areas?\n\nA. It’s really important to look at the community experts. You need to sit down with the sheriff. You need to sit down with the county administrator, the local municipality leaders, the directors of the homeless shelter, and the health department. You need to talk about what the community needs are and look at it from a community perspective, not just a CMH perspective. Then, tailor the CMH services to meet those specific needs in the most cost-effective way possible.\n\nThat’s one of the strengths that we have in the Michigan system. Even though we have set rules, set services, and set things that we have to do, there is a level of flexibility. I don’t have to spend $250,000 on a crisis van. I can take that $250,000 and invest it into smaller vehicles so 12 people can get out to help individuals in any corner of the county versus having one big van sitting in a parking lot. That flexibility and really understanding the pulse of your community is the biggest key.\n\nEstelle Slootmaker spends most workdays as a journalist and book editor.

The announcement included 10 projects in 9 states ready for construction and 69 corridors across 44 states identified for future development through two grant programs funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nThe billions of dollars worth of grants that were dolled out last week builds on the $16.4 billion investment announced last month for 25 projects of national significance along the Northeast Corridor.\n\nWhile efforts to build high-speed rail routes on the West Coast got the most attention, there were major projects funded all over the country. In Chicago, Amtrak is getting $49.6 million for track improvements at Chicago Union Station. The Downeaster will get $27.4 million for track improvements in Maine and New Hampshire. More than $143 million will be spent on track and signal upgrades on Norfolk Southern’s main line between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg to improve Amtrak Pennsylvanian service. The full list of projects can be found here.\n\nAlong with those major projects, 69 other proposals got grants of $500,000 to study expansions of existing services or the establishment of new services. Some more traditional projects include an effort to study the re-establishment of the North Coast Hiawatha across southern Montana, while more transformative projects include the establishment of a high-speed rail route between Seattle, Portland and Eugene, Ore. Other proposals include improvements to the Downeaster, with a service extension to Rockland, Maine, and looking at ways to ease transfers between North and South stations in Boston (thus connecting the Downeaster to the full Amtrak network). The full list of projects can be found here.\n\n“President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law gave us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to think smart and think big about the future of rail in America, and we are taking full advantage of the resources we have to advance world-class passenger rail services nationwide,” said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. “Today’s announcement is another step forward as we advance transformative projects that will carry Americans for decades to come and provide them with convenient, climate-friendly alternatives to congested roads and airports.

AP —\n\nA Wisconsin woman who at age 12 stabbed her sixth grade classmate nearly to death to please online horror character Slender Man will be released from a psychiatric hospital, a judge ordered Thursday after a trio of experts testified that she has made considerable progress battling mental illness.\n\nMorgan Geyser has spent nearly seven years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute. She has petitioned Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren, who committed her, for release four times since June 2022. She withdrew her first two petitions. Bohren denied her third request this past April, finding she still presented a threat to the public.\n\nGeyser, now 22 years old, filed her latest petition in October. Bohren decided to grant her release after a day-long hearing Thursday, finding that she had maximized her treatment options at the facility and is no longer a safety risk. He ordered the state Department of Health Services to set up a plan to house her in a group home and supervise her for his consideration at a hearing within 60 days.\n\nThe judge said that her crime was a “brutal, terrible offense” but Geyser has since grown up and to be truly rehabilitated she must exist as part of society.\n\n“She’s done what she’s supposed to do,” Bohren said. “She appears to have a good attitude.”\n\nGeyser and Anissa Weier were 12 years old in 2014 when they lured their classmate, Payton Leutner, to a Waukesha park after a sleepover. Geyser stabbed Leutner 19 times while Weier egged her on. Leutner barely survived.\n\nThe girls later told investigators that they attacked Leutner to earn the right to be Slender Man’s servants and they feared he would harm their families if they didn’t follow through.\n\nGeyser pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide and was sent to the psychiatric institute due to mental illness in 2018.\n\nWeier pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree intentional homicide. She was also sent to the psychiatric center but was granted release in 2021 to live with her father and was ordered to wear a GPS monitor.\n\nThree psychologists who have been working with Geyser since she was committed to the institute testified at Thursday’s hearing that she’s made impressive progress in just the last six months and should be released.\n\nDr. Brooke Lundbohm testified that Winnebago staff weaned Geyser off her anti-psychotic medications by early 2023 and she’s suffered no symptoms since then.\n\nDr. Deborah Collins said Geyser is always at risk of reoffending simply because she almost killed someone but she has worked on her coping skills, improved her emotional control and retreats into fantasy less frequently. Collins added that Geyser told her that she hates what she did to Leutner and can’t forgive herself.\n\nDr. Ken Robbins told the judge that she could become dangerous if she remained confined at Winnebago and lost hope.\n\n“The longer she’s there, at this point, the harder it’s going to be to re-integrate,” Robbins said.\n\nWaukesha County Assistant District Attorney Ted Szczupakiewicz argued that Geyser couldn’t be trusted, noting that she claimed during evaluations last year that she faked her delusions about Slender Man and actually attacked Leutner as a way of escaping her abusive father. He hinted that was a ploy to make the release more likely.\n\nThe judge shrugged that off, saying it’s not unusual for mental illness diagnoses to evolve.", "source_domain": "www.cnn.com"}

Economic output in the state grew by about 1 percent higher than initially forecast, officials said.\n\n“The strength and success we see today is no accident. It is the result of very intentional decisions made by all of us — intentional decisions to lift up opportunity in the Commonwealth of Virginia,” Youngkin said in his speech to lawmakers. “And these decisions are yielding dividends. They’re enabling us to compete and to win.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were quick to push back, particularly in light of looming Medicaid work requirements for some adults after Congress passed a reconciliation bill last month. Youngkin repeatedly said Medicaid will not be taken away from Virginians, and Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings added that hospitals will be able to absorb any additional costs from federal cuts to Medicaid.\n\nSenate Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell cited an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office this year estimating that roughly 11 million Americans will lose access to Medicaid.\n\n“The governor stood up here and said a million times, repeatedly, that nobody is coming to throw out Medicaid,” Surovell said. He added that the CBO, which “America relies upon to tell us the answers to these things, tells us that millions of Americans are going to lose their Medicaid.”\n\nDemocrats also said the governor is not fully acknowledging that the White House’s reshaping of the federal workforce will continue to impact the state’s economy. The job losses that factored into Youngkin’s assessment did not include federal workers who took buyouts and are still receiving payments until later this year, Cummings said.\n\nBut Republican House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore praised Youngkin’s presentation, calling it “the kind of news every Virginian should cheer.”\n\n“It happened because Republicans have kept a steady hand on the wheel,” Kilgore said.", "source_domain": "www.arlnow.com"}

According to Hillsborough County commissioner Harry Cohen (District 1), a future strategic partnership between Tampa International and the St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport might be able to help handle increasing foot traffic.\n\nThis collaboration would involve a transportation connection between the airports. Potentially, utilizing the new $865 million Howard Frankland Bridge, which has a section for rail systems.\n\nCohen was hesitant to say what transit technology would be used as this project would take years to plan out. However, he suggested that it might be a train or bus.\n\n“My guess is when we get to that point we’ll have options that we don’t have now,” he explained to the Catalyst.\n\nAs for what a partnership between the two airports would look like, Cohen said that models from other states could provide guidance.\n\n“We could continue to expand Tampa International Airport or we could look to a model like Dallas Fort Worth International and Dallas Love Field, and O’Hare International and Chicago Midway International where you have a large principal international airport and then a smaller airport for regional, discount and short haul flights,” Cohen explained.\n\nThis would help both airports handle demand in the Tampa Bay region. TPA currently serves approximately 25 million passengers per year. Airport officials revealed in a 2022 master plan update that they are expected to have nearly 39 million travelers annually by 2042.\n\nA partnership between the airports could correlate with building a transit system that allows individuals to travel between Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties, he said. This would help with traffic congestion and provide people with other options if they do not want to drive.\n\nInfrastructure to support it is in the works. The Florida Department of Transportation is considering using the former DoubleTree by Hilton hotel property (West Cypress Street in Tampa), a recent acquisition, as a multimodal transportation hub, Cohen added.\n\nBoth Tampa International and St. Pete-Clearwater International could offer transportation from the hub, allowing passengers to travel between airports more effectively, he explained.\n\nFlorida East Coast Industries is also desirous of investing in the bay area with its high-speed Brightline rail line, and has proposed creating a Tampa station. The multimodal hub could be connected with the future Brightline station when it is built to make traveling even more convenient, Cohen said.\n\nHe believes that an airport partnership is key to a transit system between counties. “The airports tying into it are very very important.”\n\nIt’s all about preparing for the future, Cohen added. “This is not something that you can flick a switch and have it done tomorrow, but it’s something that we need to start thinking about and planning for.”\n\nRepresentatives from both airports weighed in about a potential collaboration.\n\nA spokesperson from the St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport said that the airport is “always open to regional partnerships” and is “interested in expanding public transportation options.” However, it is currently focused on projects such as building a new parking garage and updating terminals.\n\nTampa International Airport officials prepared a statement for the Catalyst, which said that the airport “continues to explore and strengthen our regional partnerships and connections across the Tampa Bay region, including with our friends at St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport.”", "source_domain": "stpetecatalyst.com"}

The day featured a keynote address, workshops, breakout sessions and administrator discussions.\n\n“This summit is really important because it kicks off the year with professional development for all the school-based mental health professionals,” said Mayu Iwatani, senior administrator of Mental Health and Wellness for OCDE. “In lieu of doing this at their individual districts, we’re able to bring expert speakers, and they can get all the information and tools and then connect with each other. We really hope that energizes them as they go into the next school year.”\n\n‘This work is personal’\n\nCounty Superintendent of Schools Dr. Stefan Bean opened the event at the Hilton Orange County/Costa Mesa with a message of gratitude rooted in his own life experiences, recalling his childhood recovery from scoliosis surgery and his family’s experience with loss.\n\n“For me, this work is deeply personal,” he said.\n\nBean described the isolation he felt as a 10-year-old confined to a body cast for nine months, unsure if he would ever catch up to his peers. What made the difference, he said, were caring adults who noticed, encouraged him and reminded him that he was more than his circumstances.\n\nYears later, when his children lost their mother to cancer, it was counseling, encouragement and the support of the school community that helped carry them through.\n\n“We know that the challenges today are real,” he said. “Students carry anxiety, depression, trauma and pressures that we couldn’t imagine years ago. But here’s the good news: You are not only adapting to it, but you are leading. Coming here today to this summit is proof of your leadership. And so today is about equipping ourselves with evidence-based tools, practical strategies and the courage to meet students where they are.”\n\nKeynote and sessions\n\nKeynote remarks were delivered by Dr. Brian Dinkins, director of educational leadership at Butler University and CEO of the Center for Empowering Education. He similarly drew from his own journey growing up in Indianapolis, where he faced academic struggles, family instability and the challenges of poverty.\n\nWith the support of educators who believed in him, Dinkins went on to attend Purdue University, where he played football for the Boilermakers alongside future NFL star Drew Brees. He later became a teacher, coach and principal, earning multiple advanced degrees — including a doctorate — before taking on his current roles as professor and national speaker.\n\nThroughout his address, Dr. Dinkins underscored the importance of resilience and empathy — not just for students, but also for the professionals who serve them.\n\n“I’m a firm believer that if you’re okay, then those whom we serve will be okay as well,” he said.\n\n“Children are hopefully the heartbeat of your purpose,” Dinkins added. “But if we’re not taking care of the adults the same way that we take care of children, then we oftentimes find ourselves depleted.”\n\nA growing movement\n\nSince it was launched three years ago by OCDE’s Regional Mental Health Coordinators with funding from the Mental Health Student Services Act, the annual summit has grown by about 80 to 100 attendees annually.\n\nOrganizers say their goal is to continue expanding to include neighboring counties and to practitioners across sectors, including private providers.\n\nBy equipping professionals with tools, fostering collaboration and emphasizing wellness as central to education, the School-Based Mental Health Summit has become an essential part of back-to-school preparation in Orange County.\n\n“Mental health care is not an extra in education,” said County Superintendent Bean. “It is an essential in education. Because when a child is seen, heard and supported, even in their darkest season, they can heal, they can grow and they can find their strength again.”", "source_domain": "newsroom.ocde.us"}

The women's wing of a mental health centre run by the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) is the largest of only a handful of facilities in the country dedicated to helping women with mental illnesses. Locals call it Qala, or the fortress. The BBC gained exclusive access to the crowded centre where staff find it difficult to cope with the 104 women currently within its walls.\n\nAmong them are women like Mariam* who says she is a victim of domestic violence. Thought to be in her mid-20s, she's been here for nine years, after enduring what she describes as abuse and neglect by her family, followed by a period of homelessness. \"My brothers used to beat me whenever I visited a neighbour's house,\" she alleges. Her family did not want to let her out of the house alone, she says, because of a cultural belief that young girls should not leave the house without supervision. Eventually, her brothers appeared to have kicked her out, forcing her to live on the streets at a young age. It was here a woman found her and, apparently concerned about her mental health, brought her to the centre. Despite her story, Mariam's smile is constantly radiant. She is often seen singing, and is one of the few patients allowed to work around the building, volunteering to help with cleaning. She is ready - and willing - to be discharged. But she cannot leave because she has nowhere to go.\n\nQala is Kabul's largest mental health facility and houses 104 female patients\n\n\"I don't expect to return to my father and mother. I want to marry someone here in Kabul, because even if I go back home, they'll just abandon me again,\" Mariam says. As she can't return to her abusive family, she is effectively trapped in the facility. In Afghanistan, strict Taliban regulations and deeply-rooted patriarchal traditions make it nearly impossible for women to live independently. Women are legally and socially required to have a male guardian for travel, work, or even accessing many services, and most economic opportunities are closed to them. Generations of gender inequality, limited education, and restricted employment have left many women financially dependent on male breadwinners, reinforcing a cycle where survival often hinges on male relatives. Sat on a bed in one of the dormitories is Habiba. The 28-year-old says she was brought to the centre by her husband, who was forcing her out of the family home after he married again. Like Mariam, she now has nowhere else to go. She too is ready to be released, but her husband will not take her back, and her widowed mother cannot support her either. Her three sons now live with an uncle. They visited her initially, but Habiba hasn't seen them this year; without access to a phone, she cannot even make contact. \"I want to be reunited with my children,\" she says.\n\nMariam has been in this facility for nine years\n\nTheir stories are far from unique at the centre, where our visit, including conversations with staff and patients, is overseen by officials from the Taliban government. Some patients have been here for 35 to 40 years, says Saleema Halib, a psychotherapist at the centre. \"Some have been completely abandoned by their families. No-one comes to visit, and they end up living and dying here.\" Years of conflict has left its mark on the mental health of many Afghans, especially women, and the issue is often poorly understood and subject to stigma. In response to a recent UN report on the worsening situation of women's rights in Afghanistan, Hamdullah Fitrat, Taliban government's deputy spokesperson, told the BBC that their government did not allow any violence against women and they have \"ensured women's rights in Afghanistan\". But UN data released in 2024 points to a worsening mental health crisis linked to the Taliban's crackdown on women's rights: 68% of women surveyed reported having \"bad\" or \"very bad\" mental health.\n\nServices are struggling to cope, both inside and outside the centre, which has seen a several-fold increase in patients over the last four years, and now has a waiting list. \"Mental illness, especially depression, is very common in our society,\" says Dr Abdul Wali Utmanzai, a senior psychiatrist at a nearby hospital in Kabul, also run by ARCS. He says he sees up to 50 outpatients a day from different provinces, most of them women: \"They face severe economic pressure. Many have no male relative to provide for them - 80% of my patients are young women with family issues.\" The Taliban government says it is committed to providing health services. But with restrictions on women's movement without a male chaperon, many cannot seek help.\n\nThe mental health facility is in a secluded area, secured by a metal gate and barbed wire", "source_domain": "www.bbc.com"}

{"url": "https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2023/09/us-rail-travel-advances-as-brightline-opens-extension-into-central-florida/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "America’s rail revolution has taken a giant leap forward as US railroad Brightline opens its hotly anticipated extension northward to Orlando, Florida. The higher but still not quite high-speed rail line now connects Miami to Orlando in as little as three and a half hours, competitive with driving or flying. Service initially launches with eight trains per day, but will increase to 16 daily roundtrips.\n\nThe first private rail operator to inaugurate service in the United States in a century, Brightline originally launched in 2018 between Miami and West Palm Beach and shares its tracks with freight operator Florida East Coast Railway. The new section of track up to Orlando allows for an increased top speed of 125 MPH, up from a top speed of 79 MPH on the original stretch.\n\nBrightline’s Orlando station is located at Orlando International Airport’s Intermodal Terminal, providing a direct connection to Terminal C and a short automated people mover ride to the remaining terminals. It is currently the only intercity rail station located directly on airport property in the US, giving it a prime position to partner with airlines for onward journeys from plane to train and vice versa.\n\nBrightline does not extend into Orlando proper or any of the area theme parks, but may do so with a future extension to Tampa.\n\nWhile Amtrak is ever so slowly launching new trains with enhanced #PaxEx, Brightline has had the opportunity to start fresh with a brand new amenity-focused experience. The Siemens-built trainsets are the same base model Amtrak now uses throughout the Midwest, and the physical hard product does not differ significantly. While Brightline does not have a traditional café or dining car like Amtrak, it provides a cart service with limited food and beverage options.\n\nBrightline offers two levels of service called Smart and Premium, the latter adding perks like station lounge access, a 2-1 seat layout, free snacks and beverages, and even power adapters for international travelers who forget that essential item. All Brightline trains now feature onboard Wi-Fi connectivity powered by SpaceX Starlink.\n\nBrightline is looking to differentiate itself from Amtrak on Miami-Orlando — it does technically compete against Amtrak on this corridor — but it is placing a heavy focus on first and last-mile service.\n\nWhile Amtrak provides some thruway bus services, they are limited in nature and not heavily advertised. Brightline, on the other hand, offers a host of last mile connectivity options branded as Brightline+, including fixed route shuttle buses to Miami and Fort Lauderdale airports for $5-10, electric first/last mile shuttles, shuttles operating specifically for events, tie-ins with Uber including free rides within five miles for Premium fare passengers, and even a complete bike share network with 19 stations throughout West Palm Beach.\n\nBrightline is giving passengers every excuse possible to leave their car at home and take the train — a tricky proposition anywhere in the US let alone in such a car-centric state like Florida.\n\nWhen compared against international standards for train speed and passenger experience, Brightline is exceptionally average.\n\nBut Brightline need not contrast itself against the speed of France’s TGV, or the onboard experience of Japan’s Shinkansen. If it can provide a consistently positive experience that transitions would-be drivers and airline passengers to rail, it has proven that a nation once dominated by rail travel can claw back some of its lost glory days.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAll images credited to Brightline", "source_domain": "runwaygirlnetwork.com"}

With trains reaching up to 200 mph, this innovative rail line will cut the current four-hour drive to just over two hours, providing a quicker, more reliable alternative. Connecting key hubs like Las Vegas, Rancho Cucamonga, and Victor Valley, Brightline West will offer a sustainable solution to car and air travel, reducing carbon emissions and easing road congestion. As it prepares for its 2028 debut, the project will not only improve regional connectivity but set a new standard for U.S. intercity travel with its focus on speed, efficiency, and environmental sustainability.\n\nCovering a distance of 218 miles, the rail line will connect Las Vegas with Rancho Cucamonga, with an additional stop in Victor Valley. The projected cost of the project is between \\$10 billion and \\$12 billion. Once complete, the journey will take just over two hours, a sharp contrast to the typical four-hour drive. This reduction in travel time offers travelers a faster, more efficient means of reaching one of the most popular routes in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal Funding and Development Progress\n\nThe project has garnered significant support at the federal level, receiving a \\$3 billion grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation in December 2023. This critical funding enabled construction to begin in April 2024. Early-stage activities such as utility installation, surveys, and geotechnical drilling along the route have already been completed, laying the groundwork for future development.\n\nSeamless Integration with Local Transit Networks\n\nA key feature of the Brightline West project is its integration with Southern California’s existing public transportation infrastructure. The primary station in Rancho Cucamonga will be directly connected to Metrolink’s commuter rail system, allowing passengers to travel seamlessly between Los Angeles and Las Vegas without needing a car. This connection will enhance the convenience of the rail service, making it an appealing option for both local commuters and long-distance travelers.\n\nIn addition to the Rancho Cucamonga station, the other stations along the route will be equipped with essential amenities, including parking, retail spaces, and local transit links. This design aims to maximize accessibility for residents across Southern California and provide easy connections for those traveling throughout the region. By offering an efficient, car-free option, the system will help alleviate traffic congestion, particularly during peak travel periods.\n\nSustainable and Economic Benefits\n\nBrightline West is dedicated to reducing its environmental impact. With the rail system expected to cut carbon emissions by more than 400,000 tons annually, it provides an eco-friendly alternative to traditional travel methods. This initiative is in line with the broader movement toward clean energy solutions in the transportation sector.\n\nBeyond its environmental benefits, the project is set to provide significant economic advantages. During the peak construction phase, the project is expected to generate approximately 18,000 jobs. Once the system is operational, it will serve around nine million passengers per year, contributing to job creation and supporting economic growth in both Southern California and Nevada. Additionally, the rail service is expected to boost tourism and business activity in the region, making it an important driver of economic development.\n\nConstruction Timeline and Long-Term Impact\n\nTrack and station construction is scheduled to accelerate in 2025 and 2026, with full passenger service expected to begin by late 2028. The project’s completion aligns with the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, providing an ideal opportunity for Brightline West to serve the expected influx of visitors. This timing will not only meet the demand for efficient travel during a busy tourism period but will also help enhance the region’s transportation infrastructure for years to come.\n\nOnce completed, Brightline West will set a new benchmark for high-speed rail systems in the United States. Experts view the project as a model for future intercity rail networks, demonstrating the potential of public-private partnerships, innovative technology, and sustainable energy solutions to transform long-distance travel. As the first of its kind in the region, it could pave the way for further high-speed rail projects across the U.S., helping to reshape the future of intercity travel.\n\nIn conclusion, Brightline West is more than just a rail project—it’s a transformative initiative that will provide a fast, eco-friendly, and affordable travel solution between Southern California and Las Vegas. With strong federal backing, strategic planning, and an emphasis on sustainability, Brightline West is poised to change the way Americans travel across the country.\n\nAdvertisement", "source_domain": "www.travelandtourworld.com"}

Rob Bresnahan pledged to end congressional stock trading but has become one of the most active traders in Washington, selling healthcare assets as he voted to slash Medicaid and threaten Pennsylvania’s struggling hospitals.\n\nRepresentative Rob Bresnahan Jr. of Pennsylvania built his campaign on a promise to ban stock trading by lawmakers. Yet since arriving in Washington in January, the Republican freshman has become the second-most-active trader in Congress, executing at least 626 trades in just a few months, according to Capitol Trades. Now, his financial dealings are under intense scrutiny after he cashed out healthcare-related investments just as he cast votes to gut Medicaid.\n\nOn March 27, Bresnahan sold between $100,001 and $250,000 in bonds issued by the Allegheny County Hospital Development Authority for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The sale came immediately after a report identified ten rural hospitals in Pennsylvania at risk of closure, and only weeks after he voted for a House budget resolution paving the way for massive cuts to the federal safety net.\n\nThe law signed last month by President Donald Trump, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, slashes $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade. Analysts project that between 10 and 15 million Americans will lose their health coverage as a result. More than 700 hospitals across the country, especially in rural areas, are likely to shut down.\n\nBresnahan also sold up to $15,000 of stock in Centene Corporation, the nation’s largest Medicaid plan provider, on May 15. When Trump signed the bill on July 4, Centene’s stock plummeted 40 percent. The timing has drawn sharp criticism, with opponents arguing that Bresnahan protected his personal finances while exposing his constituents to devastating service cuts.\n\n“Congressman Bresnahan didn’t just vote to gut Pennsylvania hospitals. He looked out for his own bottom line before doing it,” said Leor Tal, campaign director for Unrig the Economy. “Hospitals across Pennsylvania could close thanks to his vote, forcing families to drive long distances and experience longer wait times for critical care.” Tal added pointedly, “Not everyone has a secret helicopter they can use whenever they want,” referencing reports that Bresnahan, a multimillionaire, owns a helicopter worth up to $1.5 million through a private company.\n\nBresnahan has repeatedly insisted he would not vote to cut the safety net, yet he ultimately voted for the deepest Medicaid cuts in U.S. history. His prolific trading, critics say, exposes a fundamental breach of trust. “His prolific stock trading is more than just a broken promise,” said Eli Cousin, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “It’s political malpractice and a scandal of his own making.”\n\nThe congressman has attempted to deflect the backlash by pointing to legislation he introduced in May that would bar members of Congress from buying or selling stocks while in office. But the bill would not take effect until 2027 and allows lawmakers to keep holdings owned before taking office in blind trusts. The proposal has drawn no co-sponsors.\n\nAt the same time, Bresnahan announced he was beginning the process of setting up a blind trust for his own assets but quickly complained that the House Ethics Committee was blocking him. “The ethics process is prehistoric, and it’s downright excruciating,” he told WVIA News. He argued that members from private-sector careers are left “in a bind” if they want to serve in Congress. But he balked at the idea of simply halting his trades. “And then do what with it?” he asked. “Just leave it all in the accounts and just leave it there and lose money and go broke?”\n\nEven as criticism mounted, Bresnahan continued trading. Only recently, as scrutiny intensified, has his activity slowed. It has been more than a month since he filed a new periodic transaction report. His spokeswoman, Hannah Pope, dismissed questions about the trades as an “obsession” and claimed his financial adviser manages the portfolio without his input, with Bresnahan learning of trades at the same time the public does.\n\nNational polling shows over 80 percent of voters support banning lawmakers from trading individual stocks. Yet despite bipartisan proposals to impose such restrictions, reform has stalled. Bresnahan’s own bill stands in contrast to stricter bipartisan measures requiring full divestment or blind trusts.\n\nThe controversy is reshaping the political landscape in Pennsylvania. Democrats are eager to make his trading record the centerpiece of next year’s midterms, with Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti expected to launch a campaign against him. Democratic strategists have called his stock portfolio “an opposition researcher’s dream.” Advocacy groups like the NRDC Action Fund have already launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting him, highlighting how he voted to repeal clean energy tax credits after selling off clean energy stocks and buying fossil fuel holdings. “He made out like a bandit,” the ad declares. “Tell Rob to stop trading stocks in Washington.”\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have tried to defend him. The House GOP campaign arm dismissed the focus on stock trades as “desperate Democrats’ false attacks to distract.” But even some Republicans concede privately that Bresnahan’s trades could hurt him in a competitive swing district that will be key to maintaining their narrow majority.\n\nFor constituents in Pennsylvania’s rural areas, however, the issue is more than political. The Medicaid cuts Bresnahan supported could force hospital closures, leaving families to drive long distances for emergency care and endure longer waits for critical services. The congressman’s decision to offload healthcare investments just before casting those votes has amplified accusations that he is serving Wall Street before his district.\n\n“The public should never have to question whether their elected officials are serving the public or their own portfolios,” Bresnahan said when he introduced his stock ban bill. But with his trades drawing mounting scrutiny, critics argue that very question now defines his time in Washington.", "source_domain": "www.nationofchange.org"}

But one Florida-based company is working on changing that. Brightline, which is owned by Fortress Investment Group, thinks that privatized passenger rail in the U.S. could be a better way.\n\nBrightline opened a line from Miami to West Palm Beach in 2018. It was the first privately funded passenger rail built in the U.S. in over 100 years. It will open up an expansion line to Orlando in late August. The total project cost $6 billion, according to Brightline.\n\n\"When you look at all the city pairs that exist, the places around the country that would be attractive to you, Miami to Orlando jumps off the top of the page,\" said Wes Edens, co-founder and principal of Fortress Investment Group and the mastermind behind Brightline. \"It's kind of a lousy drive between them. It's this 230 mile trip between the two places with lots and lots of trouble in between.\"\n\nThe company expects to transport 8 million people per year in Florida once it is fully operational.\n\n\"At those levels of ridership, we're going to be a very profitable organization,\" said Mike Reininger, CEO of Brightline.\n\nBrightline is also making strides to create the first dedicated high-speed passenger rail line in the U.S. connecting Los Angeles to Las Vegas. It's hoping to break ground later this year.\n\n\"We are planning to make our project, as I call it, the blueprint for America's high-speed rail industry. And so what that means is we are building in America, we are utilizing American union labor, and we'll create about 35,000 construction related jobs and 1,000 permanent jobs that are localized within the region that we're building in,\" said Sarah Watterson, president of Brightline West.\n\nBrightline is aiming to finish the line before the LA 2028 Olympics. The project is expected to cost $12 billion. It's looking to cover about a third of the cost, $3.75 billion, with a federal grant requested in partnership with the Nevada Department of Transportation.\n\n\"It is possible for private companies to deliver high speed rail and also to do it well. It seems less possible on the basis of the evidence we have, which generally show that private companies also are not able to make high-speed rail financially viable. So there needs to be a subsidy somewhere,\" said Bent Flyvbjerg, co-author of \"How Big Things Get Done.\"\n\nWatch the video to learn more.", "source_domain": "www.cnbc.com"}

experts.\n\n“The children stay for a period of time ranging from one week to several months.\n\n“Once the assessment is complete, the children return to Bermuda with a DCFS escort.”\n\nThe UNI spokeswoman said: “The evaluation consists of providing accurate diagnoses, treatment plans, follow-up care plans and life skills for managing symptoms.”\n\nShe added that medical records and other documentation that showed a child was in the care of DCFS were required by the hospital to confirm consent for evaluations.\n\nShe said that children who needed long-term or additional care could be referred to facilities “across the United States”.\n\nThe spokeswoman added: “Participating and supporting patients and/or guardians in discharge planning and placement is an expectation of our treatment team.\n\n“However, guardians are responsible for which programme they select upon discharge from our inpatient facility.”\n\nKim Wilson, the Minister of Health, said during a Budget debate in the House of Assembly in March that the psychoeducational committee used an overseas agency that specialised in “clinical and comprehensive assessments” in the best interests of children.\n\nMs Wilson, speaking on behalf of Kathy Lynn Simmons, the Attorney-General and legal affairs minister, who sits in the Senate, said: “The implementation of such an assessment is utilised to assist the Department of Child and Family Services in obtaining a clear and comprehensive understanding of the needs of the referred psycho-ed clients without an identified diagnosis or those that did not engage at all with local service providers.\n\n“The comprehensive overseas assessment assisted in the development of a dynamic, individualised treatment plan that has facilitated the most appropriate match of local community resources or an overseas therapeutic placement that will meet the client’s specific need.\n\n“All children and parents involved in the psychoeducational programme are informed of all aspects of the programme before being placed.\n\n“The court also speaks with the child and confirms with the parents that they fully understand what is involved, the location of the programme, as well as the expected length of stay.”\n\nMs Wilson said six children in the psychoeducational programme were approved for evaluation at UNI in 2018-19.\n\nShe told the House: “The comprehensive assessment and treatment programme at the University Neuropsychiatric Institute, located in Utah, offered our clients a four to six-week comprehensive clinical evaluation in a safe and secure environment.\n\n“The multidisciplinary treatment team assessed psychiatric and medical conditions, provided behavioural and educational assessments, psychological testing, therapy, and when necessary, addressed chemical dependency issues.\n\n“The programme included psychiatric evaluations provided by board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrists with diagnostic expertise in major depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, ADHD, reactive attachment, autistic spectrum disorders, and substance abuse.\n\n“The CAT programme conducted full psychological and neuropsychological testing and therapy provided by PhD psychologists.\n\n“Most importantly, CAT utilised a collaborative approach constructed by a complete multidisciplinary team consisting of child psychiatrists, paediatricians, psychologists, nurses, licensed clinical social workers, recreational therapists, art therapists, music therapists and education specialists.”\n\nMs Wilson said that two of the children were recommended for placement in an overseas institution for treatment.\n\nShe said that a report was provided to the DCFS when patients were discharged and the department was provided with “options of programmes that provide the care required to meet the needs of each child”.\n\nMs Wilson added: “As a part of the review process, every programme is reviewed both administratively as well as with a site visit, and they must be accredited by an organisation approved by the department, be approved by the Department of Homeland Security to admit international students, and have family therapy as a part of their programme.\n\n“Each programme must have weekly contact with the psycho-ed co-ordinator and provide a monthly report of the progress or lack thereof of the child placed with them.\n\n“Case reviews are conducted on a quarterly basis and any changes to treatment plans are made at that time.”\n\nShe said that all children overseas were seen every six months by a member of the psychoeducational team and a “once-a-year minimum one-on-one meeting with the director” was also arranged.\n\nOverseas assessments: University of Utah’s Neuropsychiatric Institute (Image from

Brightline is the first private entity to deliver an intercity rail system in the U.S. in more than a century, the company claims.\n\nThe new line runs from the recently-built South Terminal at the Orlando International Airport to West Palm Beach, Florida, according to a Palo Alto, California-based Brightline press release . It will connect to its existing line between Miami and West Palm Beach, which has carried passengers since 2018.\n\nBrightline divided work on the Orlando extension into four zones, and the project included constructing a $100 million vehicle maintenance facility, tenant buildout of the Orlando station at Orlando Airport, 56 bridges, three new underpasses and upgrades to 156 railroad crossings.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBrightline’s Orlando expansion broke ground in June 2019, one year after operations began in South Florida between its Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach stations. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain shortages, the opening was only slightly delayed from its original 2022 date, according to the release.\n\nThe contractors for the extension are:\n\nWinter Park, Florida-based Hubbard Construction Company, Zone 1.\n\nSanford, Florida-based Wharton-Smith, Zone 1.\n\nLittleton, Massachusetts-based The Middlesex Corporation, Zone 2.\n\nWatsonville, California-based Granite, Zone 3.\n\nMelbourne, Florida-based HSR Constructors, a joint venture composed of Herzog, Stacy and Witbeck and Railworks, Zone 4.\n\nLessons for other rail projects\n\nIn general, U.S. rail projects take longer and cost more than their European counterparts, thanks to high labor costs largely due to healthcare expenses, change orders and public transit agencies’ lack of experience in building new infrastructure. There are potential lessons to take from Brightline’s Orlando expansion, however.\n\nContractors completed the Orlando expansion quickly and relatively inexpensively, in stark contrast to California’s high-speed rail effort, which was originally supposed to span 500 miles and carry passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco. That project has seen massive cost increases — with a price tag of $128 billion at the most recent estimate, up from the $33 billion cost voters approved in 2008 — as well as delays and cuts to its network.\n\nUnlike California’s high-speed rail, Brightline mostly uses existing routes, which eliminates the need to acquire large swathes of land. Instead of building the whole line before beginning passenger services, Brightline first opened a 70-mile, revenue-generating segment between Miami and West Palm Beach in 2018.\n\nBrightline is conducting high-speed train testing in the new corridor and will test up to 110 mph through Brevard County in July. Passengers can now buy tickets for service starting Sept. 1.", "source_domain": "www.constructiondive.com"}

Despite these concerns, however, over half of employees with access to EAPs have not taken advantage of their services, which offer confidential and professional support for personal or work-related issues.\n\nAccording to Gallup, employees struggling with mental health issues miss four times more work and cost the economy $47.6 billion annually, leaving significant implications for businesses.\n\n“The workplace is facing a mental health wake-up call – and an opportunity to cultivate a more supportive culture,” said Michael Estep, president, Prudential Group Insurance. “Employers must step up to provide needed support and foster a culture where using mental health programs are not only acceptable but encouraged. By providing accessible, stigma-free, and proactive support, businesses can empower employees, strengthen workforce resilience, and boost performance.”\n\nThe study reveals that many employees are hesitant to use mental health resources or even discuss mental health at work due to barriers such as a fear of negative consequences (40%), concerns about confidentiality (38%), and worries about job security if they take a mental health leave (38%).\n\nAdditionally, the study reveals that there appears to be a large gap in communications and awareness of EAPs. Although employers believe they communicate about EAPs frequently, 22% of employees said they know little about their available benefits and 1 in 10 finds them too complex.\n\nThe report recommends that when it comes to mental health support, employers should consider options beyond the standard benefits typically offered during open enrollment.

{"url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/mental-health-insurance-trump-rules", "title": "Trump’s Rollback of Rules for Mental Health Coverage Could Lead More Americans to Go Without Care", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Series: America’s Mental Barrier: How Insurers Interfere With Mental Health Care More in this series Caret\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\n\nDuring his first term, President Donald Trump frequently turned to the issue of mental health, framing it as a national crisis that demanded action. He linked it to opioid addiction, mass shootings and a surge in veteran suicides — and he later used it to argue against COVID-19 lockdowns and school closures.\n\nAt times, he backed up his rhetoric with action. His administration issued tens of millions of dollars in grants to expand community mental health services and continued funding contracts to help federal regulators enforce the parity law, which requires insurers to treat mental and physical health care equally.\n\nBut just months after Trump returned to the presidency this year, his administration paused new rules issued in President Joe Biden’s final months that were designed to strengthen mental health protections and hold insurance companies accountable when they unlawfully denied coverage. That pause came after an industry group that advocates for large employers on issues related to employee benefits filed a lawsuit seeking to block the new rules.\n\nWhat’s more, Congress has curtailed funding for the Employee Benefits Security Administration, or EBSA, a small agency in the Department of Labor that enforces mental health parity in most employer-sponsored health insurance plans. The squeeze is largely due to the expiration of temporary supplemental funding Congress approved just weeks after Biden was elected president but before he took office.\n\nWhile the impact of these changes is hard to measure, federal employees, policy experts and front-line workers warn that suspending the rules and cutting enforcement funding could have serious consequences. They say it could mean longer waits for help when patients challenge insurance decisions, fewer investigations of insurers and employer health plans over possible violations of federal mental health protections, and more people going without care they’re legally entitled to.\n\nTheir long-term predictions include more untreated mental illness and growing anger at insurers.\n\n“Imagine if you are a parent calling about lifesaving care your kid needs,” said Ali Khawar, who was second in command at EBSA before stepping down at the end of the Biden administration. With less money and fewer employees, he said, the agency isn’t equipped to open new investigations quickly.\n\nThe suspended rules were meant to strengthen enforcement of the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. The failure to provide the same level of access to mental health care as physical care has been well documented by researchers as well as by a recent ProPublica investigation. We found that insurers often block care, underpay mental health providers and make it hard for patients to find help — sometimes with deadly consequences.\n\nThe rules, released in September 2024, required health plans to gather and report detailed data on how they restrict or deny mental health claims. If the plans found disparities when compared with medical care, insurers had to explain what they were doing to close those gaps, a requirement the Trump administration put on hold.\n\nIn his first term, Trump positioned himself as an advocate for expanding mental health services and strengthening parity enforcement. His commission on opioid abuse even recommended giving EBSA more authority to penalize insurers that violate the parity rules, though Congress never approved the proposal.\n\nBut after returning to office, his administration has moved to roll back several Biden-era initiatives, from solar energy grants to student loan relief. The new parity rules were no exception.\n\nDays before Trump’s second inauguration, the ERISA Industry Committee, or ERIC, a trade group representing large employers on employee benefits policy, sued to block the regulations. After that, the Trump administration went to court to ask to have the lawsuit paused while it considered whether to rescind or modify the rules.\n\nA federal judge granted the request, and the Trump administration promised not to enforce them during the litigation or for 18 months afterward.\n\nERIC says that the new rules went beyond what Congress intended when it created the mental health parity law and were too vague and burdensome. But advocates for the new rules said the action effectively gutted the parity law’s strongest protections.\n\n“The expectation was that these rules would be incredibly significant in driving better compliance,” Khawar said. “So now that it is on hold, it is a significant benefit that will never be realized.”\n\nJames Gelfand, ERIC’s president and CEO, said he believed the Biden administration went too far.\n\n“While we do support mental health parity generally, we don’t support this rule,” he said. “We don’t think that the Biden administration had any authority to write it.” He added that it created “an impossible standard that we can’t meet,” and that rules were “purposely vague so they could choose to enforce against whoever they wanted, whenever they wanted.”\n\nEBSA, which safeguards workplace benefits for 150 million Americans, has always had to make do with a small staff, and it was struggling even under the Biden administration, which backed its mission. In a 2023 report to Congress, the agency acknowledged that with one investigator for every 7,700 health plans, its resources “are limited compared to the vast universe that it regulates.”\n\nThose limits showed in the results: Between February 2021 and July 2024, EBSA conducted 150 investigations and issued just 70 letters finding violations of the parity law — though in many other cases, the agency worked with insurers and employers to resolve problems without a formal violation finding.\n\nAnd now it is pressing ahead with far fewer employees. The Senate Appropriations Committee has proposed holding EBSA’s base funding at the same level as last year but without the temporary boost Congress provided under the December 2020 No Surprises Act. That law, designed to protect patients from surprise medical bills, included extra funding to help EBSA handle a surge in complaints and new responsibilities.\n\nThat funding expired a few months after Biden left office. With that support now gone, EBSA’s workforce is set to drop by nearly one-fifth from two years ago, from 831 workers in 2024 to 687 or fewer employees in 2026.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee signaled that mental health parity enforcement was still a priority, including a note in its bill report saying it “supports additional efforts directed toward systemic and targeted audits of health care coverage” provided by employee-sponsored plans and to “ensure parity between mental and physical health care coverage as required by current law.”\n\nGelfand said his group wanted EBSA to be “robustly funded” so it could work to help employers comply with the law. But he said that until EBSA’s mission changes, his organization supports not adding funding.\n\nAlthough many of the positions were lost through attrition in the months leading up to the expiration of No Surprises Act funding and the start of Trump’s second term, other staffers left soon after Trump took office through voluntary separation packages.\n\nNeither the White House nor representatives for EBSA responded to questions about the paused rules or the reduced funding.\n\nA front-line worker said with so many departures, key institutional knowledge was lost. The losses have hit hardest in two key areas: The benefit advisers, who field calls from people around the country facing insurance denials they believe are wrong, are down by about 30%. The investigative staff, which leads the in-depth probes into insurance practices, has shrunk by nearly 40%, according to current and former employees. As a result, investigators are juggling higher caseloads and people seeking help are facing longer delays.\n\nEBSA oversees a wide range of employee benefits, including retirement plans, health coverage and protections under federal labor law. In recent years, enforcement of mental health parity laws has grown to make up about 25% of its investigative work, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe agency has the power to help millions of patients who have health insurance through their workplace. When investigators reveal systemic violations, they can require what’s known as a global correction, forcing insurers or plan administrators to fix a problem across multitudes of plans and patients. For example, after an investigation by EBSA’s Kansas City office, a major claims administrator agreed to stop denying drug testing tied to substance use treatment, reprocess more than 3,000 claims and return nearly $2 million to patients and providers.\n\nFor some families, it can be a matter of life or death.\n\nDuring the darkest months of the pandemic, a Massachusetts woman, who asked that her name be withheld to protect her teenage daughter’s privacy, watched her child unravel. Isolated at home, the girl started following social media videos of people cutting themselves and soon began doing the same. She became severely anorexic and started talking about suicide.\n\nThe parents got their daughter admitted to a residential treatment center, believing it was her best chance of improvement. But their insurer denied coverage, leaving them with more than $80,000 in bills. What followed was a two-year battle for reimbursement. So she turned to the Department of Labor for help. An EBSA investigator took the case, helping her navigate the complex claims process and advocating for her in negotiations with the insurer.\n\nLast year, the insurer agreed the claim had been “inadvertently denied in error” and agreed to repay most of what the family had paid.", "source_domain": "www.propublica.org"}

Safina explains that unlike substance use disorders, problem gambling lacks sufficient research, effective treatments, and public health infrastructure. The conversation explores how the ease of access through smartphones and ubiquitous, predatory marketing campaigns are fueling what she calls a “runaway train,” with data suggesting a widespread issue, particularly among young people. Safina argues for a multi-layered clinical approach combining therapy and medication, similar to models for opioid use disorder, and calls for urgent legislative action.

Today’s KevinMD article is “Why gambling addiction is America’s next health crisis.” Safina, welcome to the show.\n\nSafina Adatia: Thank you very much for having me.\n\nKevin Pho: All right, so let’s briefly share your story and talk about this KevinMD article that you wrote for us today.\n\nSafina Adatia: Yeah, so my name’s Safina. I’m originally from Canada. I trained at McGill University. I did family medicine, and then I came to Boston for an addiction medicine fellowship. It was something that was a passion of mine, and now I work as an addiction doctor. And something that I noticed just being in Boston, which is such a sports-centered city, is sports betting. Ads are literally so pervasive. My partner, my fiance, who is a Boston native, I asked him about it. He’s a big sports fan, and he was like, “Yeah, betting apps and ads and everything is just so pervasive.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd I was like, “We have to talk about this,” because even in my fellowship, behavioral addictions… we learn a lot about addictions for substances like alcohol, for opioids, for cocaine, stimulants, and things like that. But behavioral addictions like gambling are not something that’s as much covered. And so I think it’s just going to become such a pervasive issue, and I really wanted to look into it, and lo and behold, I was right. This article came to be basically from that standpoint.\n\nKevin Pho: All right, so let’s start with the Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling that kind of set what you said, this runaway train, in motion. So talk about that decision and what did that start?\n\nSafina Adatia: So that decision basically opened up sports betting as legal. Each individual state has determined its own laws around whether you can bet online, in person, and things like that. So about 39 states, is my understanding, have sports betting as legal. The states vary on who can go in person and who can do it online, but it’s not hard to get around the rules for betting online. And so it’s just become what was a hundred-million-dollar industry or a four-hundred-million-dollar industry has now become a multi-billion-dollar industry. It’s just everywhere, and the ads are everywhere. It’s just really become problematic, especially amongst the youth, I would say.\n\nKevin Pho: And I definitely second that. I listen to a lot of sports talk radio. I listen to a lot of sports podcasts, and almost every other ad is some type of sports gambling site. It’s just as easy as downloading an app, and it’s very, very frictionless.\n\nSafina Adatia: Totally. They know it’s so addictive that they incentivize you. They’re like, “Bet this, and you’ll get a bonus,” or, “Join and you’ll get $25 to bet.” There are just so many ways to get hooked on it. And there’s no one monitoring at all. If you can put in fake IDs, no one’s really checking. It’s an industry that has just catapulted with very little regulation.\n\nKevin Pho: So talk to us more about the dangers of gambling addiction and perhaps contrast that with the other forms of addiction that physicians are familiar with.\n\nSafina Adatia: Sure. Addiction in general, the pathways that are lightened up in your brain, the dopamine pathway, it’s all kind of the same mechanism that happens for alcohol addiction or for opioid addiction. The feeling of the high is all very similar. The consequences for gambling addiction, I would say, are just slightly different because it’s money. You’re spending a ton of money that oftentimes people don’t have, so you can get foreclosures on your homes. Again, it affects men right now more than women, just because men tend to be the target demographic for sports betting in general, as they’re the target audience for sports. But we’ve seen an increase in women’s sports bets as well; about a third of the market now is women.\n\nIn terms of the consequences of betting money, because it’s so addictive, people obviously have such financial catastrophes that can happen: losing their homes, losing their relationships. Suicide rates are quite high and associated with gambling as well, and we see that with generalized addiction too. However, gambling tends to affect anyone of any financial demographic just because you have the means to spend money. Whereas I find things like opioid use disorder or stimulant use disorder, you have more housing insecurity, environment, genetics—all of these things can play a little bit differently. I find with gambling, it really does not discriminate against your financial background and SES and things like that.\n\nKevin Pho: And how does gambling addiction present when you see patients in your addiction medicine clinic? What’s a typical picture of someone with a gambling addiction? How would they come to the clinic?\n\nSafina Adatia: To be honest, we don’t see a lot of people presenting with gambling addiction. That’s the main thing. A lot of people don’t recognize that they have a problem, whereas with substance use addiction, it’s just so much more pervasive where it’s recognized as a problem because the Supreme Court ruling is quite recent. Whereas alcohol and cigarettes, that was in the sixties, and now we have finally recognized that those substances are not healthy. Even then with alcohol, for example, it’s quite slow. It’s only just starting to be recognized as a dangerous substance. But if you think about the ads for smoking back in the sixties and how it was encouraged to smoke at Fenway Park—my partner was saying the ads for smoking were everywhere. And now, 60 years later, we’re able to say we finally cut down on cigarette smoking.\n\nGambling is so new. I mean, gambling’s been around forever, but the online gambling component is just so new that I don’t think people realize that they have problems with gambling as of yet. I don’t actually have a lot of patients who present in the clinic. In my mind, it’s someone between the age of 25 to 34; that’s the most common age group we see. It’s a young male who’s into sports, and people don’t necessarily think they have a problem because they’re sometimes betting small amounts, and they don’t realize how bad it can get, to be honest. I don’t think we’re going to see people presenting in hospitals or clinics for some time.\n\nKevin Pho: Now, whenever I listen to those sports betting ads, at the end, there’s always a 1-800 number, some type of hotline: “If you have a gambling problem, call this number.” Do people actually call those numbers? What happens when you do call those numbers? How effective are they?\n\nSafina Adatia: To be honest, I haven’t actually ever tried, so I’m not 100 percent sure, but I don’t think it’s enough. A 1-800 number… I mean, there are crisis lines. It’s mandatory for them to provide some type of help and assistance, and I’m sure the lines can direct them to services that are in person. But there hasn’t been a ton out there in terms of treatment for gambling use disorder.\n\nWe have some medications, but it’s really cognitive behavioral therapy: a multimodal avenue of medication, therapy, and counseling, trying to break this pattern and cycle that takes months. It’s not going to be just calling a helpline one time that’s going to help someone out of their addiction. It’s going to take time, and we actually need significantly more research because it’s just become such a widespread issue now.\n\nKevin Pho: So how does one screen for a gambling disorder, say in the primary care setting that I’m familiar with? What kind of questions should I be thinking of, or what kind of history should I be on the lookout for if someone potentially has a gambling issue?\n\nSafina Adatia: That’s a great question. There are some questionnaires that exist. Oftentimes it’s about how much are you gambling in terms of the day-to-day. Are you doing this every day? Are you doing this a few times a week? Are you hiding it? Hiding is a big component of screening for gambling use disorder. Are you hiding this from someone? Similar to other substances, you can even use the DSM criteria, to be honest, and just replace the alcohol with gambling. Like, how much money are you spending on this? Is this affecting your relationships with people? Are people thinking that you have a problem with this?\n\nSo, I would say the combination… It’s not a normal question to ask, “Is gambling a problem for you?” It’s going to be something that probably comes up in the context of that person initiating it. But once they do initiate it, I would say asking similar questions to other substances, replacing it with gambling. And then there are gambling-specific questionnaires that you can access.\n\nKevin Pho: So let’s say I ask some of these questions and I have a suspicion that the patient in front of me has a gambling issue. In terms of next steps, what are some resources? You mentioned things like cognitive behavioral therapy and potentially some medications. So from a primary care setting, where would I direct that patient?\n\nSafina Adatia: You can always direct them to an addiction medicine physician or psychiatrist. I think that’s a really good resource to start off with. In terms of the other types of treatments, SSRIs, so things like sertraline, have been somewhat studied with a little bit of effect. Naltrexone is another one. And then brand new GLP-1s, kind of like Ozempic and Wegovy, are really coming up in front in terms of treating all kinds of addiction. So, I think experimenting and trialing something is probably better than nothing to help someone. If the benefits outweigh the risks, then trying some of those medications to start and then referring them to an addiction specialist would probably be the next steps.\n\nKevin Pho: And first line, let’s say, in the contrast between naltrexone, which I know is used for alcohol use disorder, and SSRIs in a primary care setting, is there a particular one that you would lean towards first?\n\nSafina Adatia: I would say naltrexone, probably just because it’s been demonstrated to have efficacy in alcohol use disorder. What it does is it blocks the endogenous opioid pathway when it’s activated, when you have a euphoria, which essentially targets the dopamine pathway. Whether it’s going to be effective or not, we don’t really know. But again, these are such new issues and concerns that the studies are just not 100 percent there yet. We just don’t have the research to say whether this will work or not.\n\nBut I would probably start with naltrexone. You could do a combination of naltrexone and an antidepressant, especially if the person also has comorbid depression and anxiety, which again, with gambling, you often have comorbid mental health issues. So there’s nothing to say that you couldn’t try both together, to be honest, while you’re waiting to refer to therapy or things like that.\n\nKevin Pho: Have you seen or heard a success story where someone may have been diagnosed with a gambling addiction or gambling use disorder and there’s a successful treatment in turning that around? Have you seen or heard a success story that you could share with us?\n\nSafina Adatia: Personally, no. Not yet. Because as I said, we just don’t have the data or the numbers yet of people who I think are presenting in clinics with gambling use disorder. I think if you were to have more psychiatry-focused—just because again, there’s more of an abstinence-based therapy that comes with psychiatry versus in the primary care setting or addiction medicine physicians versus addiction psychiatry—I think that would be a different outcome. But for me personally, I haven’t treated very many people with gambling disorder just because it’s still so new.\n\nI also think the demographic who has a gambling use disorder, like the young male clientele, they’re not going to the doctor in general. They’re not accessing services in general. And so I think it’s going to be another five to ten years before we see this as a serious, serious problem.\n\nKevin Pho: How about from a policy standpoint? In your piece, you draw parallels to tobacco companies and the regulations that have been placed around them. So from a policy standpoint, do you see any movement or what would you like to see done?\n\nSafina Adatia: Oh my gosh, the marketing. There needs to be more restrictions on the ads. There was a study that I just read about that. When the ads are there, it really promotes the person to want to take action. We know that from anything, from buying beauty products to TikTok. Anything where you’re advertising something is going to have an effect on the person. So if they have control on the ads like they do with the pharma industry, if there’s control on what is advertised, that can really change the trajectory of these things because it’s being promoted so heavily. You walk through North Station at the TD Garden and it’s just billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard. The advertising is insane.\n\nAgain, like you said, every other advertisement that you hear on the radio and now that we have AI and on social media, you can see that the ads are going to start targeting certain demographics who are more susceptible, more prone, who are watching, and it’s just going to become this cycle.\n\nSo there needs to be control on the ads. I also think there needs to be more diligence with checking ages and IDs, especially with online sports betting, because it’s very easy to skirt around the rules. There just needs to be more restrictions on who can sports gamble, how people are able to apply for an account, and just ensuring that the youth and the adolescents who are just so much more impressionable do not have access.\n\nKevin Pho: And as far as you know, are you seeing any movement on the federal or state level regarding any of these types of regulations you’re talking about?\n\nSafina Adatia: I think there’s talk; I don’t think it’s happening yet just because the sports betting lobby is so big. It’s an $11 billion industry now as of 2024. It’s huge. So I think it’s going to take a little bit of time before we see actual progress. I think things might have to get more dire before rules are reversed.\n\nKevin Pho: All right, let’s take a step back and maybe talk outside of sports gambling. You did mention things like GLP-1 agonists in the treatment of potential addiction, and I’m seeing that in the news as well. So where are we with that? What kind of potential are we talking about, and what kind of data do we have so far regarding that?\n\nSafina Adatia: It’s still very early stage, so it’s still very much experimental. I think it still needs to be for a very target clientele because it does result in weight loss, whether we like it or not in a candidate. So you need to pick someone who may have weight loss as a goal as well as a substance use disorder.\n\nI think that it’s probably one of the most promising things we have in addiction because it really does quiet the noise in the brain. That’s what everyone says when it comes to food, and it’s what’s happening with addiction as well. We have heard from patients in these studies that when they started cutting down on the food, they didn’t have the desire to drink alcohol as much, or they didn’t have the desire to smoke cigarettes. I think that targeted therapy could have some serious widespread potential to treat substance use disorder, and I’m so excited to see what happens.\n\nKevin Pho: We’re talking to Safina Adatia. She’s an addiction medicine physician. Today’s KevinMD article is “Why gambling addiction is America’s next health crisis.” Safina, let’s end with some take-home messages you want to leave with the KevinMD audience.\n\nSafina Adatia: First of all, I want people to know that addiction can affect anyone. This is not something that is specific to people who are unhoused or who don’t have financial means. I think anyone is susceptible to addiction. If you have an issue with an addiction, with addiction in general, please, please go see a physician. Physicians are trained in this; they can get you resources and help. There are lots of resources available within your state, within your country, and online.\n\nThe main thing to note, especially for health care providers, is that this is something that is pervasive. Addiction affects so many people across the country, and almost one in five people use substances in general. More than that, people are getting addicted. I think that it’s really important to try to intervene when things are fresh and just starting out, as opposed to waiting until things have become very dire.\n\nScreening is obviously very important as a health care provider. Asking about substance use and addiction and adding gambling to that is so important, just because it’s become so pervasive in the last five to seven years and it’s just everywhere. Gambling really is affecting a lot of people now, and we need to be more mindful of that.\n\nKevin Pho: Safina, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight. Thanks again for coming on the show.\n\nSafina Adatia: Thank you for having me.", "source_domain": "kevinmd.com"}

Hill Correctional Facility", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Released: August 12, 2025\n\nDelaware County Celebrates New Leash on Life Graduation at George W. Hill Correctional Facility\n\nDelaware County, PA — George W. Hill Correctional Facility Warden Laura Williams and Reentry and Program Administrator Kelly Shaw were proud to welcome New Leash on Life USA Founder and CEO Marian Marchese, numerous GWH staff members, members of the Jail Oversight Board, and representatives of County agencies on Tuesday, August 12, to celebrate New Leash on Life USA’s latest 2025 graduation ceremony at GWH.\n\nThe milestone event marks only the second graduating class from one of the County’s newest and most impactful reentry programs—designed to foster second chances, reduce recidivism, and save the lives of both people and dogs. The six-month program, funded through $1.9 million in federal support secured by Congresswoman Scanlon for Prison-to-Community Workforce Development initiatives, is operated in partnership with the nonprofit New Leash on Life USA.\n\n“This is rehabilitation in its truest form—changing lives, building futures, and giving both people and dogs a second chance,” said Warden Laura Williams. “It’s a testament to what’s possible when we combine compassion, structure, and opportunity. I’m deeply grateful to Kelly Shaw, whose leadership and dedication have been central to bringing this program to life here at GWH.”\n\n“Over the past three months, we’ve watched our participants grow in confidence, develop trust, and take real pride in their work,” said Kelly Shaw, Reentry and Program Administrator. “Seeing Maurice, Craig, Shahid, Eric, Anthony, Kamini, Justin, David, Dwight, and Tyronne graduate is proof that with the right support and resources, transformation is possible. This program changes the trajectory of lives—human and canine alike.”\n\nDelaware County Councilmember Kevin Madden underscored Council’s pride in the program, saying, “Programs like New Leash on Life demonstrate the real impact of second chances. They equip participants with skills, confidence, and opportunities for a successful reentry, while also rescuing dogs and preparing them for loving homes. It’s an investment that benefits individuals, strengthens families, and builds a stronger community.”\n\nNew Leash on Life USA pairs participants with shelter dogs rescued from euthanasia and engages them in 12 weeks of in-facility workshops focused on dog training, life skills, career readiness, and trauma-informed care. The program is grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and animal-assisted therapy. The second 12 weeks of the program focus on individualized reentry services and paid internships, supporting participants as they transition into their communities.\n\nThe program has a proven track record. Since its first program launch in 2011, New Leash has served more than 685 people, achieving an impressive 75% graduation rate and limiting one-year recidivism to just 10.5%. In the process, it has also saved over 312 dogs and prepared them to thrive in permanent homes.\n\nGraduates receive ongoing support with job placement, transit access, housing, and health care resources, complementing the facility’s broader reentry offerings, including the award-winning PREP program and recently expanded mental health services supported by a $769,825 federal grant.\n\n“We’re so proud of our graduates—both human and canine,” said Marian Marchese, Founder and CEO of New Leash on Life USA. “Our participants and their rescue dogs created a powerful, transformative bond and put in a tremendous amount of work over the past 12 weeks, and now both are ready for their fresh start in the community.”\n\nThe transformative power of the program is evident not only to participants and partners, but also to those working with them each day. Lauren Ambrose, a Certified Dog Trainer working with the program at George W. Hill, said, “Watching participants and their dogs grow together is incredibly rewarding. Many arrive with little or no experience with dogs — sometimes even fear or negative associations — but over the weeks, I see them take accountability, build trust, and form a bond that provides a foundation for improving their lives.”\n\n“This graduation is the result of dedication, collaboration, and a shared belief in the power of second chances,” added Warden Williams. “I especially want to thank Danielle Hibbard, Director of Adult Probation; Alexandra Whittle, Chief of the Diversion and Reentry Unit at the Public Defender’s Office; Marian; and Robert Rosa, Senior VP of Programs at New Leash on Life USA. Their commitment is helping us redefine reentry and rehabilitation in Delaware County.”\n\nTuesday’s ceremony was also an opportunity to recognize the numerous George W. Hill Correctional Facility staff members and representatives of County agencies who played vital roles in the recent launch of the program, including the Office of the Public Defender, Adult Probation, the Office of the District Attorney, and many dedicated staff members.", "source_domain": "www.delcopa.gov"}

However, there is a shortage of MSCPs in the U.S.—and many states have administrative barriers that can de-incentivize MSCPs from providing timely, affordable care, particularly to Medicaid patients. For example, Maeda notes that insurance status is a key indicator for hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which can be the first line of menopause care.\n\n“Medicaid patients are 50% less likely to get HRT than privately insured counterparts,” says Maeda, who grew up in Menlo Park, California, and moved to Philadelphia during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe “secret shopper study” involved calling MSCP clinics while masked as prospective patients with different insurance types. This undercover approach has prepared Maeda—and her PURM faculty mentor, Arina Chesnokova, assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine—to assess overall access to MSCPs, as well as compare how administrative and reimbursement differences in Medicaid programs by state can shape access.\n\nPURM, organized by the Center for Undergraduate Research & Fellowships, enables students finishing their first or second year at Penn to pursue a 10-week summer research experience under the mentorship of a standing faculty member. Students receive $5,000 to support their program participation. Through her PURM project, Maeda can help inform state-based policies that enhance menopause management in the U.S. and improve access for Medicaid patients.\n\n“Part of our analysis is seeing whether MSCPs say they accept Medicaid on their websites,” says Maeda. Using this data, she can gauge “realized access”—in this case, whether MSCPs follow through on providing Medicaid patients with menopause care.\n\nUnmasking barriers to menopause care\n\nTo determine realized access, Maeda recorded various data when calling MSCPs, such as how soon patients can secure appointments; the length of time placed on hold; whether patients are seeking telehealth or in-person visits; the number of administrative tasks required of new patients; and whether they can book appointments at all.\n\nOne surprising observation, Maeda says, was that in many cases, prospective patients with Medicaid often “don’t get the appointment at all.” She notes how these patients are sometimes placed on hold for long periods of time or even transferred to other lines—which may push many to give up. Maeda found this happens regardless of whether Medicaid patients seek in-person or telehealth visits.\n\n“I didn’t understand how disheartening this process can be until I actually began calling,” she says.\n\nShe also examined the impact of Medicaid reimbursement costs and administrative burdens unique to each state. Some U.S. states have higher claims denial rates, some take longer to reimburse clinicians, and some have lower reimbursement rates than others—even though all have lower reimbursement rates compared to private insurance. This can reduce the number of MSCPs willing to accept new Medicaid patients.\n\n“We’re expecting to see a lot of claimed Medicaid providers not actually providing care,” Maeda says. “A big part of that is because even if they do accept Medicaid, they often put a limit on how many patients they are willing to have at one time with Medicaid. If their internal quota is already full, oftentimes they won’t be accepting any more.”\n\n“We’re excited to see how much of a difference there is between states with high and low reimbursement costs,” Maeda says, compared to states with “high and low administrative burden.” Medicaid patients in states with high reimbursement costs and low administrative burdens may be more likely to access care.\n\nThe impact of PURM mentorship\n\nEarly in her PURM experience, Maeda struggled to focus the scope of her research. Chesnokova’s guidance, with an emphasis on thinking systematically and promoting autonomy, helped Maeda find a relevant and promising approach.\n\n“She’s gaining a lot of valuable skills in terms of the basics of finding literature, compiling articles, finding software that helps you organize papers, [and] distilling information into words that are digestible,” Chesnokova says.\n\nMaeda notes several paths forward for this research. One route, she says, involves a closer look at telehealth and “MSCP deserts.” These areas have a scarcity of MSCPs, partially due to state-based challenges in obtaining and maintaining credentials. MSCP deserts also tend to have higher poverty rates, more people using public insurance, and more rural-based populations who rely on telehealth services.\n\n“I’m eager to see if [telehealth] could serve Medicaid patients in MSCP deserts, and this secret shopper approach could reveal many other hidden healthcare barriers,” Maeda says.\n\nThis research, Chesnokova says, can inform the development of the menopause care workforce in the U.S. and help prioritize expanded access to MSCP certification.\n\nChesnokova also notes that Maeda has already generated the data and evidence needed to be “immediately actionable from a policy standpoint.” She is ensuring Maeda has more opportunities to expand this research long after summer concludes—one of many long-term benefits that Penn undergraduates can gain from the PURM experience.", "source_domain": "penntoday.upenn.edu"}

Perkins Hospital Center, a state-run, maximum-security forensic psychiatric hospital in Maryland.\n\nThere, she met Brian Bechtold, who in February 1992 admitted to shooting and killing both of his parents in the family’s home in Silver Spring, Maryland. A state psychiatrist diagnosed the 23-year-old with paranoid schizophrenia, and a judge ruled that he was not criminally responsible for the murders on the grounds of insanity. This meant that instead of going to prison, Bechtold was sent to Perkins—indefinitely— for psychiatric care and treatment.\n\nAs the book club continued, Brottman was struck by Bechtold’s intelligence and articulateness; she wondered why, after 27 long years at the hospital, Bechtold was still being held there. Piecing together interviews with Bechtold, his medical records and legal documents involving the case, Brottman offers an insider’s view of what it’s like inside the country’s forensic psych wards in the book “Couple Found Slain: After a Family Murder.”\n\nBrottman spoke with A&E True Crime about the grim daily reality of patients in forensic psychiatric hospitals and why the hardest part is often not knowing if they’ll ever get out.\n\nHow and why do people end up in forensic psychiatric hospitals?\n\nAll the patients have committed crimes and have been sent there by a judge, but they’re not actually criminals—they’ve been judged not responsible for their crimes.\n\nSome are there because they’ve committed serious felonies and are being held for competency evaluations, to see if they have the capacity to stand trial. Some are inmates who come from other state psychiatric facilities because their behavior has been violent or aggressive and they meet the criteria for involuntary commitment. Most, however, have been found incompetent to stand trial or convicted of a crime that was committed when they were under the influence of a mental illness, like Brian.\n\nCan they ever get out?\n\nThey’re sent there until they have recovered or are considered stable enough to gradually return to the community—no matter how long that takes. For some of them, this never happens, and they stay in the hospital until they die. There’s no federal agency charged with monitoring them and no registry or organization that tracks how long they’ve been incarcerated or why.\n\nWhat’s a typical day like for Brian and other patients in these facilities?\n\nGenerally, the patients have to get up early for breakfast and there’s a lot of waiting around. The food is better than [in] prison, although they can’t have silverware—everything is eaten with a spoon. There are a lot of groups—therapy groups, daily function groups. There are some groups run by volunteers, like yoga or book clubs or debate groups. And then there’s a lot of downtime where they have to be on the ward but they can’t go back into their rooms. They have to mix with other people.\n\nUsually, there are people just sitting around, watching TV or playing cards. They have a certain amount of time where they can go outside into a little courtyard and play basketball or hang out. Many of the patients have jobs [within the facility], so Brian’s currently working as a medical assistant, taking records from office to office, but he’s also worked as a janitor and in the gardens. He gets paid for that work, too.\n\nAnd then he’ll see his psychiatrist probably once a week. He doesn’t really have visitors at the moment—because of COVID-19, they’re on Skype—but patients can have visitors a couple of times a week. And they can get parcels, including certain amounts of food and books and things like that, which is better than prison. Basically, it’s pretty monotonous and there’s a lot of downtime with nothing in particular to do.\n\nWhat has life been like for Brian in the hospital?\n\nAt first, he got help, attended lots of therapy groups, and did pretty well. But the psychiatrists wanted him to take medication, and he got into conflicts about that. Over time, he felt as if he’d recovered his sanity, but his psychiatrists disagreed. The medication made him impotent and incontinent. He started to believe he’d never get out.\n\nAt one point, he took a hostage, tried to escape, and got shot by the police. Another time he attacked a social worker. He’s witnessed three patient-on-patient murders. At one time, he had a doctor who was declared criminally insane. He was diagnosed with cancer and recovered. He represented himself in court twice, trying to argue for his release.\n\nBy now, he’s been there longer than almost anyone else, including many of the doctors. He’s had a very interesting and traumatic life.\n\nHow are forensic psychiatric hospitals similar to or different from prisons?\n\nIn theory, they’re very different from prisons. Most are co-ed. The patients are called patients, not inmates. They don’t have numbers. They can dress in ordinary clothes. They get therapy and treatment from doctors. They’re given medication, sometimes against their will. They’re being treated, not punished. There are more amenities. The food is a lot better. They can have visits from friends and family, and can actually sit with them and give them a hug. They’re usually released into the community gradually, over a year or so.\n\nIn other ways, they’re very similar to prisons. They’re surrounded by fences, patrolled by guards, the patients are put in solitary confinement, and other punishments are used. The difference is that patients don’t have sentences—they stay there until someone decides they’re well. Brian and many other patients have tried to get sent to prison, and those who have succeeded say it’s much better. They’re treated with more dignity.\n\nHow so?\n\nYou’re not being judged all the time and you’re not seen as a patient, but just an ordinary person. With Brian, the problem is that everything he does is seen as a symptom instead of a rational choice that anyone might make. In prison, you can stay in your room, you can choose not to go to meals, you can choose not to go out into the yard, and it’s not jotted down in your file as a symptom of an illness—it’s just a choice.\n\nThe other thing is that in prison, even if you’re doing a life sentence, you’ve got a determined time. What’s really ground Brian down is this constant hope that if he does this or if he does that, maybe he’ll get out or maybe another doctor will let him out. It’s this constant not knowing and not having any sense of making progress toward a goal.\n\nHow often are people ruled not criminally responsible because of a mental illness and sent to forensic psychiatric hospitals in the U.S.?\n\nContrary to popular opinion, the ‘insanity’ defense is rarely used, and it definitely isn’t an easy way to get out of going to prison. According to an eight-state study, it’s used in less than 1 percent of all court cases and, when it’s used, it has only a 26 percent success rate. And of those cases that are successful, 90 percent of the defendants have been previously diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nThere are about 250 state psych hospitals in the U.S., and most states have two or three.\n\nWhat are the biggest misconceptions you hear about forensic psychiatric hospitals and their patients?\n\nA lot of people picture these places as full of crazy, dangerous people, but many of the patients are intelligent, articulate people with the same needs, desires and fears as anyone else. The secrecy that surrounds them really feeds into the ‘us versus them’ mentality, which is really stigmatizing. It’s just too easy to see it as evil people doing evil things. There’s less of a line between the perpetrator and victims than most people think. Perpetrators can be victims, too.\n\nIt’s much more complicated than it seems and there are lots of grey areas when it comes to crime.\n\nIn your research, did you come across evidence of abuse in these facilities?\n\nThere’s some abuse in all psychiatric hospitals and I’ve included some statistics in the book about guards being fired for mistreating patients. But there are those acts of abuse that are very overt and then there are more subtle kinds that may not necessarily fall into the category of abuse.\n\nThe psychiatrists are really overworked and have big caseloads and can get ground down and frustrated and… they just lose empathy. It’s that kind of abuse that can be almost more insidious than acts of violence.\n\nThe staff know [the patients have] done this dreadful thing that’s often very high-profile, and part of the treatment regime is learning how to behave like everyone else in a normal, regular way, so unusual behavior is usually condemned and sometimes punished. People who are unruly are put in restraints and drugged and it’s not considered punishment, it’s considered treatment, but it’s not clear how helpful that is. But there are acts of violence, too. The patients are violent with each other, and the staff are sometimes violent to the patients.\n\nThe type of crime that Brian committed—a child killing his parents—has been called a ‘schizophrenic crime.’ What are the typical characteristics of this crime?\n\nThere’s been a lot of work done by psychiatrists on children who kill their parents and it’s always in situations like Brian’s, where the parents are in their mid-50s, the child has suffered years of abuse.\n\nThey’re often mostly white, middle-class families. The child is mentally ill and the parents are mentally ill. It’s like a hothouse. If the child was in a different situation, the crime might not have occurred, but that kind of situation is a breeding ground for violence, especially when there’s mental illness. The crime is unpremeditated and it’s usually when the parents are going about their ordinary business, like cooking dinner or something. It’s almost always a surprise [to everyone else] because it’s often families who keep to themselves and everyone in the community thinks of them as a perfect family. There’s a lot of horror surrounding it.\n\nRelated Features:\n\nSerial Killer Ed Gein Was a ‘Model Patient’ After Being Incarcerated for His Gruesome Crimes\n\nSociopath or Temporarily Insane: The Murder Trial of Shayna Hubers\n\nWho’s the Most Psychopathic of All?

The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Towson Rehabilitation Center LLC and chief executive officer Howard Neels for failing to remit employees’ contributions to the company’s 401(k) plan, in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\nThe suit resulted from an investigation by the Washington District Office of the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration, which found that, since January 2006, the defendants have failed to remit employee contributions to the plan, remitted certain employee contributions late without interest and failed to segregate the plan’s assets from the general assets of the company.\n\n“This case clearly demonstrates a breach of fiduciary duty,” said Norman Jackson, EBSA’s acting regional director in Philadelphia. “We will hold fiduciaries accountable when they fail to act in the best interest of plan participants.”\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, the suit seeks to restore to the plan all losses, including interest and opportunity costs, as well as the cost of an independent fiduciary. The suit also seeks to permanently bar the defendants from serving in a fiduciary capacity to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA, and appoint an independent fiduciary with plenary authority and control with respect to the management and administration of the plan.\n\nThe case was filed by the Labor Department’s Regional Office of the Solicitor in Philadelphia.

One person familiar with the company’s response efforts who was not authorized to speak to the press said that the attack “looks and smells like ransomware.”\n\nRansomware is a type of malicious software that spreads across computer networks, encrypting files and demanding payment for a key to decrypt them. It’s become a common tactic for hackers, though attacks of this scale against medical facilities aren’t common. A patient died after a ransomware attack against a German hospital in early September required her to be moved to a different hospital, leading to speculation that it may be the first known death from ransomware.\n\nHackers seeking to deploy ransomware often wait until the weekend, when a company is likely to not have as many technical staff members present.\n\nTwo Universal Health Services nurses, who requested to not be named because they weren’t authorized by the company to speak with the media, said that the attack began over the weekend and had left medical staff to work with pen and paper.\n\nOne of the nurses, who works in a facility in North Dakota, said that computers slowed and then eventually simply would not turn on in the early hours of Sunday morning. “As of this a.m., all the computers are down completely,” the nurse said.\n\nAnother registered nurse at a facility in Arizona who worked this weekend said “the computer just started shutting down on its own.”\n\n“Our medication system is all online, so that's been difficult,” the Arizona nurse said.\n\nWhile many patient charts at that facility are on paper, medication information is maintained online, though it’s backed up at the end of each day, the nurse said.\n\n“We had those up to date as of the 26th,” the person said.\n\n“Now we had to hand-label every medication,” the nurse said. “It's all improv.”\n\nRansomware can devastate hospitals. In 2017, a ransomware strain called WannaCry, created by hackers working for the North Korean government, spread across the world and infected the U.K.'s National Health System even though it wasn't a direct target. The attack disrupted at least 80 medical facilities, though there were no publicly reported deaths associated with the incident.\n\nKenneth White, a computer security engineer with more than a decade of experience working with hospital networks, said that the delays caused by ransomware attacks can have dire consequences for patients.\n\n“When nurses and physicians can't access labs, radiology or cardiology reports, that can dramatically slow down treatment, and in extreme cases, force re-routing for critical care to other treatment centers,\" he said. \"When these systems go down, there is the very real possibility that people can die.\"", "source_domain": "www.nbcnews.com"}

The newly formed platform company, Blended Health, is focused on expanding access to care for adolescents and adults struggling with acute mental health challenges with primary emphasis on group services consisting of partial hospitalization programs (PHP) and intensive outpatient programs (IOP).\n\nAs of its launch, Blended Health is operating eighteen clinics across Texas and Tennessee with plans to add more locations in 2024. Blended Health employs over 400 team members, including more than 300 medical psychiatrists, psychiatric physician assistants, advanced psychiatric nurse practitioners, as well as licensed clinical therapists offering onsite and virtual treatment options in medication management, group and individual therapy. Blended Health will continue to operate in Texas under the consumer-facing brand, Connections Wellness Group, and will begin converting all of its Tennessee locations to the Connections Wellness Group brand in February.\n\nBlended Health is founded and led by CEO Matt Morgan and sponsored by Summit Partners, a growth equity investor with extensive and long-standing experience in the healthcare sector. As part of the merger, CWG founder and former CEO Awstin Gregg has transitioned out of this role and begins serving as an advisor. Morgan will lead a newly formed executive team to support the growth of Blended Health.\n\n“It is an exciting time to launch our company and continue increasing access to expert care and high-quality outcomes provided by our medical and clinical providers,” said Morgan. “We are focused on connecting people to what matters in mental health by providing PHP and IOP services to adolescents and adults in a unique and profound way.

Programs are offered during both the day and evening to accommodate schedules.\n\nThere is a growing behavioral health crisis in the U.S., exasperated by a shortage of mental health providers relative to growing demand. Currently, many Americans experiencing mental health challenges seeking treatment wait up to three months to receive treatment, and fewer than 50% of adults and 70% of adolescents experiencing mental challenges receive treatment.\n\nBlended Health’s mission is to expand access to outpatient behavioral healthcare services for adolescents and adults struggling with acute mental health challenges by providing a strong continuity of care that includes convenient, innovative, and high touch individual and group services.\n\n###\n\nAbout Blended Health: Blended Health is a behavioral healthcare company backed by Summit Partners, growth-focused alternative investment firm managing more than $36 billion in capital dedicated to growth equity, fixed income and public equity opportunities.

Shot on location in black and white, the film charts Fanon’s time as the head doctor of a psychiatric ward in the Algerian city of Blida. After his arrival in 1953, he would soon revolutionise the racist and antiquated practices employed by the institution, which segregated its French Christian patients from their Algerian Muslim counterparts.\n\nFanon’s achievements during his tenure are recounted in an episodic, vignette-like fashion. From incorporating creative and athletic activities as a part of therapy to implementing more humane treatments for the Indigenous patients, he radically transformed the hospital. His successes, however, were met with disapproval from some of his white French colleagues. Zahzah explores such tensions – as well as Fanon’s relationship with the patients – primarily through conversation; much of the narrative is made of discussion or consultation scenes, filmed largely in shot-reverse shot style. Even with Alexandre Desane’s grounding presence in the lead role, the ubiquitousness of these compositions results in stylistic monotony – a stark contrast to Fanon’s famously incendiary writing.\n\nBut what emerges from these sequences is the strong link between imperialist violence, psychological trauma and mental illness. Far more than any other illness, imperialism is the disease that infects the souls of those living in occupied territories. An understanding of this relationship is the driving force behind Fanon’s psychiatry practice and political activity, the latter of which is touched on but not dealt with in depth here.\n\nThough not quite as exhaustive as its lengthy title would suggest, this film remains a compelling study of a rarely portrayed figure, and of the dehumanisation inflicted by French colonial psychiatry.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com"}

The letter warns of negative impacts for students if the federal government goes ahead with plans to cut funding for mental health programs.\n\nWhy are attorneys general sending a letter to the Department of Education?\n\nBig picture view:\n\nThe attorneys general have expressed concern over proposed changes to federal grant programs that support mental health services in schools, warning that the revisions could hinder efforts to assist students and create bureaucratic challenges for districts seeking funding.\n\nWashington Attorney General Nick Brown.\n\nIn a multistate comment letter submitted Monday by the Washington State Attorney General’s Office, the attorneys general urged the DOE not to limit schools' abilities to support students' mental health needs.\n\nThe letter addresses the department's proposed changes to the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program and the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThese programs were funded by Congress through 2026 following mass shootings at schools in Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas, to provide mental health services in high-need schools.\n\nThe proposed changes, the attorneys general say, would further implement the department's decision to discontinue previously awarded grants, a move that Washington state challenged in court earlier this year.\n\nThe attorneys general argue that the changes would unnecessarily restrict the services school psychologists can offer, apply vague conditions to the awards, and impose requirements that may conflict with existing federal obligations.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nWashington Attorney General Nick Brown criticized the proposals, stating they would limit the ability of school counselors and social workers to support student mental health. He also expressed concern that the changes could reduce resources for students who do not speak English or who are gender diverse, despite the department's responsibility to enhance the safety and well-being of all students.\n\nThe letter was signed by attorneys general from Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island.\n\nMORE NEWS FROM FOX 13 SEATTLE\n\nClosures of Fred Meyer in Tacoma, WA impacting 200 employees, creates 'food desert'\n\nWA troopers make 2 arrests using plane to track down driver, motorcyclist\n\nIn-N-Out Burger opens in Ridgefield, WA this week\n\nSpecial Forces vet exposes tactics of Montana, Washington state survivalists: 'Can't stay hidden forever'\n\nThis is the best community college in WA, report says\n\nReptile Zoo to close in Monroe after 30 years\n\nTo get the best local news, weather and sports in Seattle for free, sign up for the daily FOX Seattle Newsletter.\n\nDownload the free FOX LOCAL app for mobile in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for live Seattle news, top stories, weather updates and more local and national news.", "source_domain": "www.fox13seattle.com"}

These cuts to health care coverage are unprecedented and cruel. The State Department of Health will continue to work with Governor Kathy Hochul, our dedicated hospital systems and state agency partners to take every measure possible to mitigate the impact of this bill.”\n\nState Senator Luis R. Sepúlveda said, “The so-called “Big Ugly Bill” is not just a political threat; it's a direct assault on the most vulnerable in our community. In the Bronx and across New York City, hundreds of families will see their health and food benefits cut, while hospitals face financial collapse. Our community faces the loss of more than $900 million in SNAP benefits, while more than 27,000 people will lose their Medicaid coverage and more than 4,000 will be excluded from the Essential Plan. I represent the 32nd Senate District — one of the poorest districts in New York — where families depend heavily on these essential services to meet their most basic needs. This is more than a budgetary concern; it is a humanitarian crisis that demands thoughtful action. I look forward to working with Governor Hochul and my colleagues in the State Legislature to develop a comprehensive plan that not only safeguards these vital supports but also strengthens them, ensuring all New Yorkers have the stability and resources they need to thrive.”\n\nState Senator Robert Jackson said, “This ‘Big Ugly Bill’ is more than bad policy—it’s partisan cruelty and a direct assault on the health, dignity, and survival of millions of New Yorkers. At a time when families are already struggling under the weight of rising costs, Washington Republicans have chosen to rip food from children’s tables, medicine from our elders, and lifelines from working people. In New York, we know health care is not a privilege to be rationed—it is a right that must be defended. That is why I stand with my colleagues to reject these cruel cuts and to fight with every tool of law and legislation to protect our hospitals, safeguard SNAP, and ensure that no family is forced to choose between feeding their children and healing their loved ones. Our message is clear: we will not let ideology triumph over humanity. We choose care over cruelty, justice over sabotage, and a government that serves the people—not punishes them.”\n\nState Senator Nathalia Fernandez said, “The reconciliation bill would cut health coverage for over a million New Yorkers, reduce nutrition assistance, and strain hospitals across our state. At a time when families are working hard to get ahead, we should be focused on expanding access and strengthening the safety net. When we do that, families are healthier, communities are stronger, and New York moves forward together.”\n\nAssemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz said, “Trump's legislation passed by the Republican Congress will have a devastating impact in New York and throughout the country. The cuts to healthcare, to SNAP benefits, and so much more, will pay for tax cuts to the super rich and corporations. This would be the largest transfer of wealth, from poor to rich, in the history of the world. This will not only affect an incredible amount of people, but it will also explode the federal deficit. This is unacceptable and we need to fight this in every possible way.”\n\nAssemblymember Yudelka Tapia said, “The Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress are working to implement their radical agenda on the backs of our most vulnerable families. The so-called ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is nothing more than an attack on working-class New Yorkers. Stripping health care from over two million people and cutting food assistance for hundreds of thousands of households will devastate communities like ours in the Bronx. These cuts will shutter hospitals, drive up costs, and force families to choose between paying medical bills or putting food on the table.”\n\nAssemblymember George Alvarez said, “The so-called ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is nothing more than a direct attack on the health and wellbeing of New Yorkers. Here in the Bronx, the cuts to Medicaid, the Essential Plan, and SNAP will devastate our most vulnerable families, seniors, children, immigrants, and patients battling chronic illness. Stripping away health care coverage from millions and food assistance from hundreds of thousands is unconscionable and will push families deeper into poverty while overwhelming our hospitals and clinics. I stand with Governor Hochul, Representative Torres, and my colleagues in sounding the alarm: we will not sit silently while Washington Republicans balance their agenda on the backs of working families in our community.”\n\nAssemblymember Landon Dais said, “They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder — but New York State Republicans must be blind if they think this so-called ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ is anything but ugly for New Yorkers. By siding with Donald Trump, they’ve chosen loyalty to him over loyalty to our state and country. This bill rips food off the tables of working families, threatens to bankrupt New York’s farmers, abandons our veterans, and guts Medicaid in ways that will leave horrifying outcomes for our healthcare system. It hurts New Yorkers, it hurts New York businesses, and it is nothing less than a direct threat to our great state.”\n\nAssemblymember Emérita Torres said, “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is nothing short of an attack on the Bronx. By slashing Medicaid and gutting SNAP, this legislation rips away lifelines that tens of thousands of families in the 85th Assembly District depend on to survive. In a community already facing some of the highest rates of asthma, diabetes, and food insecurity in the country, these cruel cuts will deepen deadly health disparities and force parents to choose between medicine and meals. To add insult to injury, the same bill hands out massive tax breaks to billionaires while working-class families in the Bronx are left to suffer. This bill doesn’t just ignore the Bronx — it targets us, and the consequences will be measured in suffering and lives lost.”\n\nBronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson said, “The 'Big Ugly Bill' will devastate the Bronx, stripping away the programs and social safety net that our residents and families desperately need. Nearly a million Bronx residents depend on Medicaid for healthcare, and almost half of our Bronx families rely on SNAP to put food on the table every day. These cuts are not only morally unjust but will also underfund our hospitals, cost thousands of jobs, and force too many Bronx residents to go without basic needs. I stand with Governor Kathy Hochul, Congressman Richie Torres, and our healthcare leaders in fighting back against these cuts that will further harm our communities and disproportionately impact our most vulnerable residents.”\n\nCABS CEO Sherly Demosthenes-Atkinson said, “For over 45 years, CABS Health Network has been a trusted provider of home care, care management, and social support services—helping seniors, children, families, and other vulnerable New Yorkers live with health, dignity, and independence. Nearly all of those we serve rely on Medicaid and SNAP—not only as safety nets, but as essential pathways to care, nutrition, and community services. With over 95% of our operating budget and eligibility tied to Medicaid, any reduction in access to this program doesn’t just threaten our ability to serve—it threatens the health and well-being of thousands across our communities. We stand firmly behind Governor Hochul as she leads the charge to protect Medicaid, safeguard vital services, and uphold the values of compassion and equity that New Yorkers deserve.”\n\nCouncil Member Kevin C. Riley said, “Cuts of this magnitude are devastating blows to working families, seniors, and children in communities like the Bronx who already face barriers to healthcare and food access. Stripping over a million New Yorkers of coverage and forcing hundreds of thousands of households to lose SNAP will deepen inequality and destabilize families who rely on these lifelines every day. As a Council Member, I am proud to lead this fight alongside Governor Hochul, Congressman Torres, and our partners in government to protect the dignity, health, and future of New Yorkers.”\n\n", "source_domain": "www.governor.ny.gov"}

{"url": "https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/infrastructure/article/55283600/strategies-us-high-speed-rail-expansion", "title": "Unlocking high-speed rail: Strategies for U.S. expansion", "published_at": null, "full_text": "The vision of high-speed rail in the U.S. is no longer just a vision—it is steadily becoming a reality. As momentum builds, key projects are demonstrating how strategic investment, private sector engagement and innovative project delivery can accelerate progress.\n\nBrightline West is set to become the U.S.’s first privately owned high-speed rail line, connecting Las Vegas to Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., via a 218-mile corridor. Meanwhile, California High-Speed Rail Authority is advancing its 171-mile initial operating segment, laying the groundwork for an eventual 500-mile system linking San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nBeyond Brightline West and California high-speed rail, nearly 100 projects are in various stages of planning and development, with federal, state and local funding advancing both high-speed and intercity passenger rail systems. The high-speed rail projects in various stages of development include corridors in Texas from Dallas to Houston and Fort Worth to Houston; Cascadia Corridor in the Pacific Northwest; High Desert Corridor in California; and a corridor connecting Charlotte, N.C., to Atlanta.\n\nAs these projects progress, they provide valuable insights into accelerating high-speed rail development with greater efficiency. While each aim to deliver a fast, safe and modern travel alternative—capable of sustained speeds of at least 186 mph—they all employ distinct strategies to navigate funding, streamline project delivery and integrate new technologies.\n\nThe rail industry can build on these lessons to fast-track future projects, leveraging private investment, alternative delivery models and emerging technologies to create a high-speed rail network that meets America’s unique needs. A successful nationwide rollout will require strategic investment, public-private collaboration and policy support.\n\nStrategies for advancing high-speed rail\n\nTo realize the promise of high-speed rail in the U.S. with greater efficiency, four key strategies are essential.\n\n1. Unlocking private investment\n\nA collaborative framework is essential for delivering high-speed rail projects, bringing together public sector leadership and private sector innovation to efficiently advance transportation infrastructure. Successful partnerships align public planning and regulatory expertise with private sector investment and project execution capabilities.\n\nGovernment agencies play a critical role in early-stage planning for high-speed rail by identifying and securing corridors, advancing environmental approvals and engaging communities. These efforts help create market-ready opportunities that attract private investment, reducing reliance on public funding while ensuring projects align with broader transportation goals.\n\nFor example, Brightline West capitalized on a corridor that had been under study for 20 years. With a preapproved alignment and environmental permits in place, Brightline was able to move forward efficiently. The project’s delivery model leverages private activity bonds and precleared alignments to minimize delays, demonstrating how early public sector involvement can facilitate successful private sector investment. This project also attracted public funding through Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) grants.\n\nA combination of early public sector planning with private capital, expertise and innovation can help accelerate project timelines, reduce reliance on public funding and improve overall project efficiency. This cooperative approach demonstrates how strategic public-private collaboration can advance high-speed rail development while aligning with broader transportation goals in the U.S.\n\nBrightline Florida Case Study: A Model for Private Rail Delivery\n\nBrightline Florida is currently the only privately owned and operated intercity passenger railroad in the U.S., offering sustainable and safe travel between Miami and Orlando, Fla. It stands as a pioneering example of how private sector leadership, strategic project delivery and infrastructure reuse can accelerate rail development.\n\nBy utilizing the existing Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) corridor, Brightline Florida minimized land acquisition needs, streamlined environmental permitting and reduced overall construction time. By upgrading this corridor and strategically constructing new segments, HNTB helped Brightline deliver a premium passenger rail experience in a fraction of the time it would take to develop a new corridor from scratch.\n\nPhase 1 (Miami–West Palm Beach, completed in 2018): Focused on upgrading existing rail infrastructure within the FEC corridor, utilizing a design-build approach to modernize tracks and stations.\n\nPhase 2 (West Palm Beach–Orlando, completed in 2023): Required new track construction along a greenfield corridor between Cocoa and Orlando, integrating advanced rail technologies and grade-separated crossings for high-speed operations.\n\nWith Brightline Florida now demonstrating that privately funded intercity rail can succeed, it serves as a model for future rail projects.\n\n2. Leveraging alternative delivery models\n\nHigh-speed rail development benefits from flexible project delivery models tailored to specific project needs. Given the complexity of high-speed rail, different project elements—track construction, station development, rolling stock procurement and signals and systems—often require tailored delivery methods.\n\nDesign-build contracts bundle design and construction under a single contract. This approach establishes clear owner performance requirements while allowing the design-builder to identify and implement efficiencies in both design and construction after contract award. By enabling concurrent design and construction, design-build delivery fosters innovation and helps mitigate project delays.\n\nVariations of this model include design-build-operate-maintain, design-build-finance-operate-maintain and other models that may extend private sector involvement to different phases of the project, such as operations, maintenance and even financing.\n\nFor California high-speed rail, the team is considering a combination of traditional design-bid-build contracts with more collaborative delivery methods, such as progressive-design-build and construction manager/general contractor. Brightline West has elected to use the design-build delivery method based on its desire to optimize design and construction efficiencies and improve coordination through a single contract that spans different project phases.\n\nThis model also enables real-time engineering optimizations, allowing the project to adapt quickly to changing conditions and site-specific challenges, which is especially beneficial for sections requiring extensive earthwork.\n\nThe choice of delivery model depends on factors such as the project’s stage of engineering and design, the level of risk the project owner is willing to take, the need for flexibility and innovation, project complexity and scope, schedule constraints, private sector capacity and market conditions, and long-term operation and maintenance needs. Different delivery methods can also create opportunities to streamline the permitting process by facilitating early collaboration between project stakeholders, including third party agencies and regulatory bodies. By integrating right-of-way acquisition, environmental approvals and design development under a single contract, these models can accelerate the decision-making and ensure a more coordinated approach to project delivery.\n\nFrom an agency perspective, greater specificity in contracts can reduce risk by clearly defining scope, deliverables and performance requirements, which can allow for more accurate cost estimates and better financial planning. However, giving contractors room for innovation also may yield faster and more cost-effective solutions. Striking the right balance between prescriptive requirements and performance-based flexibility is key to achieving faster, more innovative and potentially lower-cost project execution.\n\nBrightline West case study: Accelerated timelines\n\nToday, nearly 50 million annual trips occur between Los Angeles and Las Vegas—over 85 percent of them by car—a trip which is unpredictable, unreliable and challenged by congestion. Brightline West expects to serve more than nine million one-way passengers annually.\n\nAs a close supporting partner to Brightline West, HNTB led the planning/concept design, preliminary engineering and supported the environmental documentation for 183 miles of the high-speed rail service line in California and critical components system-wide, working closely with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), local agencies and the FRA.\n\nAt the initial stages of the project, HNTB proposed innovative conceptual and preliminary design solutions that assured Caltrans and the state of California that the rail line could be built efficiently and safely—and without adverse impacts to traffic—as an enclosed rail corridor within the median of Interstate 15. As a result, the overall project impact and construction schedule was reduced from the initial design concept and the established I-15 right-of-way will fast track overall delivery.\n\n3. Driving innovation through emerging technologies\n\nA key technology for high-speed rail is overhead electrification, which powers trains efficiently. However, emerging technologies such as hydrogen and battery-electric propulsion are beginning to complement traditional electrification. Brightline West’s use of battery-electric propulsion on inclines showcases how hybrid approaches can enhance system efficiency.\n\nOther technological advancements include:\n\nAdvanced signaling and Positive Train Control (PTC) to enhance safety and optimize train speeds.\n\nPredictive maintenance using artificial intelligence and Internet of Things sensors, reducing downtime and improving reliability.\n\nReal-time passenger information systems and digital ticketing, streamlining the rider experience.\n\nThe gradual integration of these technologies allows for incremental system improvements, ensuring long-term scalability while adapting to market demand.\n\n4. Optimizing trainset procurement for efficiency and scale\n\nProcuring trainsets for high-speed rail requires a strategic approach to balance cost efficiency, interoperability and long-term sustainability. Standardizing specifications, coordinating bulk orders across projects and fostering domestic manufacturing can help drive down costs while ensuring high-quality, reliable equipment.\n\nFragmented procurement remains a challenge, with individual projects pursuing custom trainset orders that can create supply chain backlogs and inefficiencies. A more coordinated approach, such as joint procurement agreements between multiple rail corridors, can create economies of scale, reduce per-unit costs and accelerate deployment timelines.\n\nFor example, Brightline West and California high-speed rail have collaborated to ensure interoperability of the two systems, as there is a potential connection between the two corridors in the future. By aligning technical standards early in the process, these projects are positioning themselves for seamless integration that could benefit the broader U.S. high-speed rail network.\n\nAdditionally, aligning trainset procurement with federal Buy America requirements supports domestic manufacturing and supply chain development, strengthening the industry for future high-speed rail expansion. Investment in standardized, interoperable train technology can also enhance flexibility, allowing trainsets to be deployed across multiple corridors as the network grows.\n\nWith limited manufacturers producing high-speed trainsets that meet U.S. performance and procurement requirements, procurement strategies must proactively address key industry concerns. This includes structuring commercial terms that account for price escalation due to global market shifts, ensuring favorable payment terms and incorporating performance surety provisions that provide confidence to manufacturers.\n\nAs more suppliers establish U.S.-based affiliates and production facilities, rail agencies have an opportunity to align procurement strategies with both high-speed rail and regional transit markets. Leveraging existing supply lines can further streamline procurement, reduce lead times and create a more resilient domestic production ecosystem for future rail expansion.\n\nA roadmap for the future\n\nAs the U.S. advances toward a modern high-speed rail network, the lessons learned from Brightline, California high-speed rail and other emerging projects underscore the importance of meticulous early planning, private sector engagement and strategic project execution.\n\nBy embracing public-private partnerships, alternative and more collaborative delivery models and cutting-edge technology, the U.S. can accelerate project delivery, optimize costs and create a high-speed rail system tailored to its unique infrastructure needs.\n\nHigh-speed rail in the U.S. is closer than ever to becoming a transformative force in American transportation. Now, the challenge is to build on this momentum, expand connectivity and ensure that high-speed rail is an efficient and scalable solution for the future.", "source_domain": "www.masstransitmag.com"}

But it’s not just opioids—overdoses involving stimulants, prescription medications, and combinations of substances are also on the rise. Behind every statistic is a person—a loved one, a neighbor, a friend—whose life was cut short, often without warning.\n\nRaising awareness is more than wearing a ribbon or attending a vigil—it means having honest conversations about addiction, reducing the stigma that keeps people from seeking help, and understanding that recovery is possible with the right support.\n\nEducation also plays a crucial role. Learning to recognize the signs of overdose, how to use life-saving tools like naloxone, and where to find resources can make a difference in a moment that matters.\n\nThis month is also an opportunity to show support for families and individuals affected by substance use disorder. Whether through local events, social media campaigns, or simply checking in on someone who may be struggling, small actions can have a powerful impact.\n\nAs we move through Overdose Awareness Month, let us remember that every life lost was preventable—and every life saved is worth fighting for.

Less than two years after its debut, LIFE confronted its readers with a devastating photo essay on an issue that has long bedeviled humanity: namely, how to treat those among us who suffer from debilitating, and often frightening, mental disorders.\n\nEven today, Alfred Eisenstaedt’s photographs from the grounds of Pilgrim State Hospital on Long Island are remarkable for the way they blend clear-eyed reporting with compassion. But what is perhaps most unsettling about the images is how terribly familiar they look.\n\nThe treatment of mental illness in all its confounding varieties and degrees has come a long, long way since the 1930s, and in most countries is now immeasurably more humane, comprehensive and discerning than the brutal approaches of even a few decades ago. Advancements in psychiatric medications alone have helped countless people lead fuller lives than they might have without drugs. And yet . . . the grim, desolate tone of the pictures in this gallery can feel eerily familiar.\n\nThe tone struck by LIFE, meanwhile, in its introduction to the Pilgrim State article—while employing language that might seem overly simplified to our ears—is at-once earnest and searching:\n\nThe day of birth for every human being is the start of a lifelong battle to adapt himself to an ever-changing environment. He is usually victorious and adjusts himself without pain. However, in one case out of 20 he does not adjust himself. In U.S. hospitals, behind walls like [those] shown here, are currently 500,000 men, women and children whose minds have broken in the conflict of life. About the same number, or more, who have lost their equilibrium, are at large. Their doctors say they have mental diseases. Their lawyers call them insane.\n\nMentally balanced people shun and fear the insane. The general public refuses to face the terrific problem of what should be done for them. Today, though their condition has been much improved, they are still the most neglected, unfortunate group in the world. [This photo essay features] pictures showing the dark world of the insane and what scientists are doing to lead them back to the light of reason.\n\n—This photo gallery edited by Liz Ronk for LIFE.com.\n\nPilgrim State Hospital, Brentwood, N.Y., 1938.

The reason for this is in large part due to the absence of the Curva Sud.\n\nA ‘very serious’ problem\n\nThe Prosecutor’s Office’s orders and certain decisions by the club itself have meant that swathes of fans who occupy the Secondo Anello Blu have been ‘blacklisted’ and therefore cannot attend. Michele Criscitiello spoke live on Sportitalia, with an impassioned plea.\n\n“Milan have a problem. You can buy all the players you want, but if Milan – or even Inter, I don’t know – doesn’t resolve the Curva issue, it’s a very serious problem. Milan are managing the situation very badly, in my opinion, because when you go from too much to nothing, something is wrong.\n\n“First, cages were opened for the management of the Ultras and the Curva: there was no control. Then the Milan Public Prosecutor’s Office investigated, and now Milan are waging war on the Curva.\n\n“Those who protested at Casa Milan are no longer allowed in, there are no warnings, but season tickets and tickets are blocked for the Curva’s protagonists and those close to them: this is a problem.\n\n“Milan also have to be a little selfish and intelligent, just like Inter. But I’m not judging Inter’s situation because yesterday I saw Milan-Bari. If you think of playing Milan-Bari in an acoustic desert, in total silence, then Milan-Bari, on August 17th, is fine. But Milan-Inter, Milan-Juve, Milan-Napoli, Milan-Cremonese on Saturday…\n\n“The ultras, or rather the Curva, are crucial to a football team. They’re crucial to a club, because they control the entire stadium’s support. This doesn’t mean you should succumb to blackmail or compromise, absolutely not. You have to set guidelines, but you need the Curva!\n\nCriscitiello su San Siro: “Il Milan deve risolvere, non è più uno stadio‼️” Continua la protesta della Curva Sud: niente tifo organizzato anche per la sfida di Coppa Italia tra #Milan e Bari🏟️ Il commento di @MCriscitiello nel corso di SiCafè🗣️#Sportitalia pic.twitter.com/4TEf5StKx7 — Sportitalia (@tvdellosport) August 18, 2025\n\n“Either you manage it and don’t suffer from it, but you can’t kick them out. Because on Sunday at San Siro, Milan would have been unthinkable without fans. And now that the season is starting, Milan can make all the signings they want, but if the fans aren’t among those signings, you’ve lost everything.\n\n“And what I was reading today… In the Curva, there were people wearing PSG jerseys, people wearing Barcelona jerseys, people wearing Real Madrid jerseys. It can’t be football for tourists; it has to be football for Milan fans. You can’t go (to the Curva) wearing another team’s shirt.\n\n“This doesn’t mean delinquency, it means order, rigor, and discipline for your team. Otherwise, Milan will become nobody’s son.

{"url": "https://www.denvervoice.org/archive/2025/8/19/new-executive-order-could-reshape-us-response-to-homelessness", "title": "New Executive Order Could Reshape US Response to Homelessness — The Denver VOICE", "published_at": "2025-08-19T00:00:00", "full_text": "by Franziska Wild\n\nHow the US approaches homelessness could soon shift drastically.\n\nThe White House announced a new executive order, aimed at addressing homelessness, on 24 July. The order, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets,” reverses support for longstanding federal policies like housing first, and pushes local governments to remove people living outside by forcing them into institutional settings.\n\nThe order also encourages localities to enforce bans on camping, following last year’s Supreme Court ruling that made it legal for jurisdictions to arrest or otherwise punish people for sleeping outside. Experts and advocates for people experiencing homelessness warn that the order will make it harder for local governments to solve homelessness and will harm people in the process.\n\n“Everything about the order is deeply concerning. It will do significant damage to individuals experiencing homelessness and will set back federal homelessness policy by 30 years,” Jeff Olivet, the former executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), told Street Sense.\n\nUSICH is the federal agency responsible for developing a strategic plan to address homelessness. It was defunded by President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this year.\n\nThe order argues that mental health and drug use are root causes of homelessness, a common belief that many advocates argue is a misconception. In D.C., just 25% of people experiencing homelessness report having a mental health condition and 14% a substance use concern, according to the most recent Point-in-Time Count.\n\nA return to involuntary commitment\n\nAs part of its focus on mental illness, the executive order encourages states and local governments to put people experiencing mental illness into institutional treatment through “civil commitment” — a legal process through which a person can be detained and treated in a psychiatric facility against their will.\n\nInvoluntary commitments, also known in D.C. as FD-12s, intersect with how the states and D.C. approach homelessness. Street Sense has witnessed city officials use the process as a threat to coerce encampment residents who refuse to move or accept shelter, and occasionally, the city has committed people during encampment closures. 2,930 emergency petitions to commit residents were filed in 2023, according to the Office of the Attorney General.\n\nThe executive order instructs the Department of Justice, under the Attorney General, to seek the reversal of judicial precedents and consent decrees that make it harder to place people experiencing mental illness into institutional settings. D.C. does not currently have any consent decrees limiting its use of civil commitment, and the D.C. Council would need to pass any laws changing the commitment process, which, in most cases, requires a court order in the District.\n\nWhile this executive order does not force local jurisdictions to increase their use of civil commitment, it encourages them to “adopt maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and ‘step-down’ treatment standards.” It also offers “technical guidance” and grants to municipalities that wish to expand their use of civil commitment.\n\nThis encouragement worries advocates and experts, who say that prior to the 1960s, the US forced people into institutional settings and psychiatric hospitals for extended periods.\n\nExperts say that there is little data showing that involuntary treatment is effective when it comes to treating substance use disorders.\n\n“This Executive Order overlooks smart policy solutions that can effectively address substance use disorders and homelessness, opting instead to prioritize coercive and enforcement-based measures,” Stephen Taylor, president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, wrote in a statement. “It also misleadingly portrays involuntary civil commitment as a simple fix to the complex challenge of treating addiction among unhoused individuals.”\n\nIncentivizing encampment cleanups\n\nThe executive order also incentivizes municipalities to enforce prohibitions on behaviors including “open illicit drug use,” “urban camping and loitering,” and “urban squatting.”\n\nThe order instructs the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Secretary of Transportation to prioritize giving grants to states and localities that restrict these behaviors.\n\nJesse Rabinowitz, the communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center, said that this provision “encourages states to make it a crime to be homeless, which is the most expensive but least effective solution to homelessness.”\n\nAccording to Rabinowitz, this section of the executive order could incentivize states to conduct encampment clearings and impose criminal penalties on camping by offering them federal money in the form of grants such as the Continuum of Care grants offered by HUD. But, he added, “I think a lot of this is going to come down to implementation.”\n\nCamping is officially banned in D.C. Although city officials rarely impose criminal penalties for camping, they frequently conduct encampment closures throughout the city. The White House has placed a special emphasis on trying to clear encampments in D.C., with Trump writing recently on Truth Social that “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY.”\n\nIn March, Trump signed an executive order that established the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force, giving it the mandate to lower crime in D.C. and “beautify” the city. That order directed the National Park Service to promptly remove “all homeless or vagrant encampments and graffiti on Federal land” in the District. From March through 31 July, NPS closed 66 encampments on NPS-managed lands in the District, according to Jasmine Shanti, a spokesperson for NPS.\n\n“Following President Trump’s Make D.C. Safe and Beautiful Executive Order, NPS strengthened our encampments record-keeping to better support public safety and park stewardship,” Shanti wrote. Past NPS closure data is not readily available, but from May to September 2024, NPS closed nine encampments, according to past reporting by Street Sense.\n\nEnding Housing First\n\nThe final section of the executive order dramatically changes which policies the federal government officially views as solutions to homelessness. Most consequently, the order ends support for a longstanding federal approach known as Housing First.\n\nHousing First policies focus on first moving someone into housing without any expectation that they first engage in treatment for substance use disorder or mental health challenges. The policy has long enjoyed bipartisan support—it was first implemented under the George Bush administration. Many voucher programs, including Permanent Supportive Housing vouchers, fall under this approach.\n\n“Decades of research have shown 85-90% success rates in keeping people housed, including people suffering from mental health and substance use issues,” Olivet said. “The approach outlined in the order has little if any evidence to support it.”\n\nIn the last decade, however, conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation have attacked housing first as a “far-left idea premised on the belief that homelessness is primarily circumstantial rather than behavioral” in policy documents like Project 2025.\n\nThese groups have sought the reversal of housing first in favor of approaches that prioritize transitional housing programs and require people to receive treatment before they receive housing. This executive order moves this agenda forward by instructing HUD to end support for Housing First. It argues that housing first policies “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency.”\n\nHUD provides assistance, in the form of annual grants, to localities to help address homelessness. The order pushes states, cities, and programs that receive HUD funding to require people to receive substance use disorder or mental health treatment as a condition for receiving housing. The order also ends federal support to programs that offer harm reduction services such as safe consumption sites or needle exchange.\n\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner praised the executive order in a press release, stating that HUD will “continue implementing the EO’s directives by encouraging accountability through tangible outcomes, including addressing substance use disorder.”\n\nExperts like Olivet argue that this shift is misguided because of the evidence in favor of housing first and harm reduction programs.\n\nIn D.C., Housing First is the prevailing approach used by the city government and outreach providers. In fact, major outreach providers like Pathways to Housing pioneered housing first approaches in the 1990s. Programs in D.C. also receive considerable HUD funding. In 2024, the District received almost $40 million in grants for programs like the emergency shelter grant. The recent shift could jeopardize this money, leading to a loss of services for people throughout the District.\n\nHow long the changes will take to come into effect remains to be seen. HUD notices of funding open at the end of the summer, but the full extent of funding cuts might play out over several years.\n\nBut in D.C., the impact may be more immediate. On 11 August, Trump federalized the Metropolitan Police and directed them to clear encampments in the city.\n\n“What we’re seeing happening in D.C. today,” Rabinowitz said, “is a direct result of this executive order. The impacts are already being felt.”\n\nCourtesy of Street Sense Media / INSP.ngo", "source_domain": "www.denvervoice.org"}

{"url": "https://www.techtarget.com/healthcarepayers/news/366629225/Breaking-down-uninsured-numbers-under-Trumps-spending-law", "title": "Breaking down uninsured numbers under Trump's spending law", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Approximately 10 million will become uninsured over the next decade under President Donald Trump's sweeping spending law for the 2025 fiscal year, according to new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n\nThe estimated number of people slated to lose insurance under the law is in line with what CBO released in July when the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law on July 4, 2025.\n\nMedicaid will lose the most individuals under the spending law through 2034. Still, policies related to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplaces and health taxes will also result in massive increases to the U.S. uninsured rate.\n\nThe Trump Administration's goal to reduce healthcare fraud, waste and abuse will also result in more uninsured Americans as the law's policies related to eligibility for Medicaid and Health Insurance Marketplace subsidies change.\n\nBut just how many individuals will lose Medicaid, Medicare and other sources of insurance coverage and when? And what policies in particular will lead to the most cuts?\n\nMedicaid to see the greatest enrollment decline The spending law targeted Medicaid spending and enrollment in particular. As a result, Medicaid is slated to see the greatest decline in enrollment numbers compared to Medicare and the Health Insurance Marketplaces, according to the latest CBO projections. CBO estimated 7.5 million people would become uninsured by 2034 due to Medicaid policy changes under the spending law. That number represents three-quarters of the total 10 million slated to lose insurance under the law. In comparison, Medicare policy changes would result in about 100,000 more uninsured people by 2034. Meanwhile, policy changes to the Health Insurance Marketplaces would lead to 2.1 million more uninsured people over the next decade. Interactions among policies would also result in 300,000 more uninsured, CBO reported.\n\nKey Medicaid policies contributing to uninsured numbers Several Medicaid policy changes in the spending law will contribute significantly to the growing uninsured population within the next decade. First, the largest contributor to the uninsured population by 2034 would be Medicaid work requirements, referred to as \"community engagement\" requirements in the law. The mandatory work requirements would contribute to 5.3 million uninsured by 2034, CBO projected. Section 71119 of the spending law establishes Medicaid work requirements for certain adult individuals eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act's expansion rules. To maintain Medicaid coverage, these individuals must complete at least 80 hours per month of qualifying activities, including paid employment, workforce training, community service and/or half-time education. The spending law essentially eliminates state discretion to implement work requirements previously administered under Section 1115 demonstration waivers. The law requires states to implement work requirements by January 1, 2027. The second highest contributor to the uninsured number is provider tax changes, as detailed in Section 71115, which would lead to 1.1 million uninsured by 2034, CBO reported. Through Section 71115, the Trump Administration aims to stop \"abusive finance practices\" by limiting the use of state taxes to finance their share of Medicaid costs. In particular, the spending law restricts the use of taxes that enable providers to recoup the money through Medicaid payments and prohibits these \"hold harmless\" arrangements in new taxes after July 4, 2025. Thirdly, Medicaid eligibility redeterminations would lead to 0.7 million insured individuals by 2034. As detailed in Section 71107, states must more frequently conduct eligibility redeterminations, with Medicaid expansion states having to review eligibility for beneficiaries qualifying under expansion rules every six months. Finally, the moratorium on implementing a rule related to eligibility and enrollment for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Basic Health Program would lead to 0.4 million uninsured by 2034. The rule finalized under the Biden Administration seeks to streamline enrollment in these programs by eliminating barriers and simplifying requirements, including preventing renewals more often than every year, using pre-populated renewal forms and allowing at least 30 days for individuals to return documentation for renewal. Section 71102 pushes implementation of the rule to October 1, 2034.\n\nMajor Marketplace changes contributing to the uninsured rate While Medicaid is staring down major changes to enrollment, the spending law will also significantly impact Health Insurance Marketplaces. Based on the CBO analysis, the major Marketplace changes by impact through 2034 include: Permitting the premium tax credit for only specific individuals (Section 71301), which will lead to 0.9 million more uninsured people.\n\nRequiring eligibility verification for the premium tax credit (Section 71303), resulting in 0.7 million additional uninsured people after its implementation in 2028.\n\nDisallowing the premium tax credit in case of certain coverage enrolled in during special enrollment periods (Section 71304), leading to 0.4 million additional uninsured people.\n\nDisallowing the premium tax credit during periods of Medicaid ineligibility because of alien status (Section 71302), creating 0.3 million additional uninsured people.\n\nEliminating the limitation on recapture of advance payment of premium tax credits (Section 71305), leading to 0.1 million additional uninsured people. Collectively, these Marketplace policy changes will result in about a fifth of the total projected increase in uninsured individuals under the law.

One bought what he thought was Xanax on the underground market, and the other bought what he thought was Percocet (oxycodone plus acetaminophen).\n\nThe Post reported that Harris County medical examiners have already seen four cases of nitazene-related overdoses.\n\nNitazenes can be much more potent than fentanyl and may need several doses of the overdose antidote naloxone to reverse an overdose.\n\nI have been concerned about nitazenes for quite some time. In a 2020 blog post, I asked, “Will Isotonitazene Replace Fentanyl on the Black Market?”:\n\nReacting to the fact that the synthetic opioid fentanyl and its analogs— largely made and smuggled into the US by labs in China—are responsible for up to 75 percent of opioid-related deaths, the Trump administration persuaded China to impose a ban on the production of fentanyl and its analogs in April 2019. By the fall of 2019, a new synthetic opioid, isotonitazene, made its debut in the US and Canadian black markets. The drug, which is not a derivative of fentanyl but equally as potent, is legal to export from China and is not banned in North America or Europe.\n\nThe World Health Organization reported that isotonitazene started appearing in forensic toxicology reports in Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Sweden, the U.K., and the US in early 2019. In a 2022 blog post, I noted that the Tennessee Department of Health reported a fourfold increase in overdoses involving nitazenes from 2019 to 2022.\n\nNitazenes are made from a completely different precursor than fentanyl. Piperidine is the precursor for fentanyl, but the precursor for nitazenes is benzimidazole, a compound used to produce various useful medicines such as blood pressure pills, antacids, and antifungal agents. The Swiss drugmaker CIBA, now Novartis, developed the first nitazenes as potential pain relievers in the 1950s but never marketed them.\n\nWriting in USA Today in January 2024, Josh Bloom and I warned:\n\nThere are two primary reasons that the emergence of nitazenes in the street drug supply is alarming. One is their extreme potency. An analog called etonitazene may be as much as 1,000-fold more potent than morphine. By comparison, fentanyl is only 100 times more powerful than morphine…. The other reason is that nitazenes are different from fentanyl and its derivatives because researchers fairly well understand the range of the potency of numerous circulating fentanyl derivatives; it is unlikely that any new, unknown derivatives will be more dangerous than those already known and can be identified. However, researchers know little about nitazene derivatives. Scientists don’t understand how modifications to their chemical structure will affect their potency, making nitazenes the “Wild West” of street drugs.\n\nThe Harris County toxicology lab identified N‑pyrrolidino protonitazene as the form of nitazene responsible for the deaths of the two young Texas men. The Post article claimed it is 43 times more potent than fentanyl. Like most toxicology labs across the country, the Harris County lab does not routinely test for nitazenes unless they suspect the drug or if no other substances can explain the overdose.\n\nIn March 2023, I testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Government Surveillance, which was considering what later became known as the HALT Fentanyl Act (“Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl”). The Act classified new fentanyl analogs as Schedule I drugs and increased penalties and mandatory minimum sentences for possessing or trafficking in these fentanyl derivatives. I told the representatives that the so-called “iron law of prohibition”—the harder the enforcement, the harder the drug—explained fentanyl’s emergence in the illicit drug supply. I warned them about recent evidence of nitazenes appearing in the drug supply.\n\nI also told the subcommittee, “I wouldn’t be surprised if two or three years from now, we are talking about the ‘nitazene crisis’ instead of the fentanyl crisis.”\n\nI went on to say, “If policymakers double down on the same prohibitionist policies they have employed for over 50 years, deaths from illicit drug overdoses will continue to rise. Doing the same thing repeatedly, with even more vigor this time, will not yield a different result.”\n\nI concluded my remarks with, “I urge the Subcommittee to avoid doubling down on policies that will not only fail to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl but will fuel the development of more deadly replacements.”\n\nWhile the HALT Fentanyl Act did not advance during the 2023–2024 session of Congress, the Senate passed the bill in March of this year, the House passed it in June, and President Trump signed it into law on July 16.\n\nFrom fentanyl to nitazenes, the pattern is clear: stricter bans don’t eliminate the danger; they just rename it. Unless we change our strategy, more families will experience the heartbreak that those Texas parents are going through now.\n\n# Reprinted with permission.

The researchers analysed the hospital admission rates per 1,000 inhabitants of all Austrian municipalities over five years. As the study shows, admission rates depend significantly on two factors: proximity to hospitals and the availability of psychiatric care in private practice. This means that residents of municipalities with hospitals or with hospitals in neighbouring municipalities are statistically more likely to receive inpatient treatment for depression. The results point to possible discrepancies between patients' needs and the medical care structure and were recently published in the specialist journal \"Health Policy\".\n\nIn the study, Michael Berger and Judit Simon from the Department of Health Economics at MedUni Vienna's Center for Public Health examined data from 93,302 hospital episodes between 2009 and 2014 from 2114 municipalities. The results show that hospitalisation rates due to depression are significantly higher in communities with hospitals than in communities without. The differences between urban, suburban and rural areas are particularly striking. In suburban communities, admission rates for depression are up to 13 per cent higher than in rural communities, indicating a possible influence of hospital supply on the demand for inpatient treatment. In communities with hospitals, the rate of depression admissions is up to 12 per cent higher than in those without.\n\n\n\nThe analysis also shows a spatial \"spillover\" effect: if a hospital is located in a municipality, it not only affects hospital admission rates in the local population but also in neighboring municipalities. This effect can be observed even for general hospitals without dedicated psychiatric wards, suggesting that the availability of hospital resources in general influences patient flows across municipal boundaries. \"These geographic patterns of admission rates show that the mere presence of hospitals plays a strong role in determining whether patients with depression are hospitalised, even if no specific psychiatric beds are available,\" clarifies study author Michael Berger.\n\n\n\nThe results also suggest that the high number of hospital admissions due to depression in certain regions cannot be explained solely by the actual need for inpatient care, but also by the structure of healthcare provision. A lack of outpatient care and the geographical concentration of hospitals in urban and suburban areas may lead to an inefficient distribution of healthcare resources. The authors conclude from the results that a better link between inpatient and outpatient healthcare facilities and targeted promotion of psychiatric care could help to reduce the number of avoidable hospital admissions. \"Improving timely access to outpatient care and early-stage treatment can reduce the burden of avoidable hospitalisations on patients and public budgets and close a gap in unmet need for care for vulnerable populations,\" emphasises study author Judith Simon.\n\nPublication: Health Policy\n\nUrban-rural disparities in hospital admissions for depression in Austria: A spatial panel data analysis.\n\nMichael Berger, Martin Zuba, Judit Simon\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2024.105209", "source_domain": "www.meduniwien.ac.at"}

If found guilty, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Violanti, who is handling the case, stated that according to the criminal complaint, the Buffalo Office of the Drug Enforcement Agency has been investigating online websites, including “MEDDZONLINE.COM,” which sell counterfeit pharmaceutical and controlled substances. The website has listed for sale medications such as Percocet, Adderall, Alprazolam, and Oxycodone. MEDDZONLINE.COM and related websites are believed to be part of a larger organized drug trafficking organization, operating domestically and internationally. After orders are received, the organization sends a bulk shipment of drugs via international mail, to a U.S. based bulk re-shipper, which are then sent to domestic re-shippers who are responsible for shipping out the individual orders via USPS to customers. These domestic re-shippers are paid by the drug trafficking organization for each package they mail out to customers.\n\nIn February 2024, the DEA began investigating a non-fatal overdose in the Silver Creek area, where the victim purchased drugs five separate times from the MEDDZONLINE.COM website, including Valium, Ambien, and Tapentadol. Payment was made to an individual in Pakistan. This exchange shows the flow of money back to the head of the drug trafficking organization overseas in Pakistan, even though the website advertises the drugs as originating in the USA and shipping within the USA. Subsequently, investigators conducted several controlled purchases through the websites operated by the head of the drug trafficking organization. One of the controlled purchases identified defendant Tandel as a co-conspirator operating in the Mobile, Alabama, area. Law enforcement believes he is a distributor of illegal controlled substances and/or counterfeit substances through the United States Postal Service. He is believed to have mailed at least 40 packages from Summerdale, Alabama, to locations across the country, including Buffalo.\n\nDuring the investigation, law enforcement also conducted undercover purchases from defendant Wright in Georgia. Wright is also accused of shipping packages across the country, mailing out a total of 333 parcels containing a variety of Schedule II and Schedule IV drugs.

For many of us Latinas, the journey of breastfeeding can feel like it comes with so many opinions: family expectations, cultural taboos, advice from the various mommy groups that are circulating, and even side-eyes from strangers. I still remember those breastfeeding days. It felt like I was nursing around the clock, as if the days and nights blurred into one long stretch. The physical pain was something I hadn’t fully expected. I spent hours on the phone with the lactation consultant, desperate to figure out how to make it work. Deep down, I always told myself, “He has to eat one way or another,” and I wasn’t opposed to formula. But the pressure to keep producing, to have enough milk, to meet everyone’s expectations was constant. Society, social media, and even the voices in my own head made me feel like breastfeeding was the only “right” way.\n\nSo I researched every trick and supplement to boost supply, built up a freezer stash, and even kept formula on hand “just in case.” Looking back, those 14 months were some of the hardest of my life – physically, emotionally, mentally. So mujer, if you’re in it right now, I commend you. It truly is a sacrifice we make for our little ones. And yet, behind every instagram-worthy nursing photo or glowing story, there’s also the unspoken emotional toll: the cracked nipples, sleepless nights, stress over supply, and the endless pressure to keep producing that so-called “liquid gold.”\n\nIn many Latino families, breastfeeding is both expected and policed. Your tia might proudly remind you how she nursed her kids for two years, while your mom says, “tapate” if you dare feed your baby in public. Formula, meanwhile, often comes with whispers of judgement, as if choosing it means that you’ve somehow failed.\n\nAdd in the endless “advice” online – oatmeal, teas, pills, pumping schedules, lactation cookies – and it’s no wonder so many of us feel overwhelmed, anxious, and or even ashamed. What should be a nourishing act can quickly turn into another space where we are expected to meet impossible standards.\n\nStay connected!

Thank You! You are already subscribed to our newsletter\n\nAs it is, postpartum already brings hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, and identity shifts. When breastfeeding challenges pile on top, it can intensify anxiety and even lead to depression. Many women silently carry feelings of guilt – “am i doing enough” – or resentment – “why is it all on me?.” It’s important to name these emotions for what they are: natural responses to a stressful situation, not personal failings.\n\nSetting Boundaries with Family\n\nFamily is at the heart of our culture, but that doesn’t mean every comment is helpful. Learning to set boundaries can protect your mental health and give you space to make the choices that work best for you and your baby.\n\nPractice short, firm responses: When someone insists you “just try harder if you’re struggling with nursing” or “cover up,” in public, a calm reply like, “This is what works for us” can end the conversation without an argument.\n\nWhen someone insists you “just try harder if you’re struggling with nursing” or “cover up,” in public, a calm reply like, “This is what works for us” can end the conversation without an argument. Lean on allies: If your partner or a supportive family member can redirect or step in during conversations, let them share the emotional labor. You don’t have to do it alone.\n\nIf your partner or a supportive family member can redirect or step in during conversations, let them share the emotional labor. You don’t have to do it alone. Give yourself permission to say no: You don’t owe anyone an explanation for how you feed your baby, remember that.\n\nWhat More can Help:\n\nBreastfeeding is as much emotional as it is physical. These coping strategies can help ease the pressure:\n\nGrounding exercises: When you notice your anxiety rising – whether during a painful latch or a family comment – try the “5,4,3,2,1” grounding technique: name five things you see, four things you feel, three things you hear, two things you smell, and one thing you taste. Set realistic goals: Instead of committing to an arbitrary timeline, give yourself permission to take it one week at a time – or even one day – at a time. Remember, you know you best. Therapy and support groups: Speaking with a mental health professional, especially one who understands Latina cultural dynamics, can provide not only tools but validation as well. Postpartum support groups are also powerful reminders that you are not alone. Body care: Simple things like staying hydrated, using soothing nipple balms, or scheduling rest breaks matter more than another Pinterest lactation smoothie recipe. Redefine success: Whether you nurse, pump, combo-feed, or use formula – what matters most is your baby being fed and you being well. You are important!\n\nThe reason breastfeeding feels so heavy isn’t just the act itself – it’s the cultural, social, and personal expectations layered on top of it. As Latinas, we often carry the weight of familismo, wanting to honor traditions while navigating modern realities that we live in. That tension alone can stir guilt and anxiety. Recognizing that these pressures exist outside of you can help. On one hand, it connects us to generations of care, tradition, and community. On the other hand, it can create expectations that make us forget how personal and individual breastfeeding really is. What works for one mama may not work for another, and that truth deserves to be honored without shame.\n\nA final Word to the Mamás\n\nIf you’re breastfeeding right now, know this; you are already doing enough. Whether your journey is smooth, messy, short, or long – it is valid. Your worth as a mother is not measured in ounces of milk.\n\nSo, mujer, the next time someone tells you to “tapate,” take a deep breath and remind yourself – you’re not just nourishing your baby, you’re rewriting what it means to mother in your own way. And that is something worth honoring this Breastfeeding Month.\n\nPatricia Alvarado is a psychotherapist focused on mental health issues affecting the Latinx community.", "source_domain": "hiplatina.com"}

If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison.\n\nA medical commission of doctors from Moscow’s Alexeyeva psychiatric hospital found on March 15 that Tater showed “tension, impulsiveness [and] delusional ideas and attitudes”, including a sense of “persecution” and “lack of critical attitude towards his state”.\n\nA Moscow court agreed to a request from doctors at a psychiatric hospital for Tater to undergo forcible hospitalisation as an inpatient due to mental illness, state-run TASS news agency reported on Sunday, citing court documents.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the court issued the decision to hospitalise Tater.\n\nTater’s trial is due to begin on April 14. TASS reported his case could be dismissed if the Meshchansky District Court accepts the psychiatric diagnosis, which could lead to court-ordered treatment instead of trial.\n\nThe US citizen was sent to undergo inpatient psychiatric checks at Moscow’s Serbsky Centre as part of the investigation into his case.

Five campuses were also destroyed or severely damaged, district officials said, and cleanup is still ongoing, including at schools that are open.\n\nWhat’s new: PUSD Superintendent Elizabeth Blanco said the district’s starting this school year with students’ mental health in mind. “We have to really make sure that their social well-being is OK so that they're ready to learn,” she said. “I think our teachers always connect with students first, but this year some of our students may need more support and connection than they have in previous years.”\n\nExpanded support: Blanco said the district recently hired a crisis counselor, and has new “MTSS” — or Multi-Tiered System of Supports — coordinator positions to support teachers in meeting students’ social and emotional needs. MTSS is a series of gradually escalating responses to help students according to their needs. The district is also offering free teletherapy for students outside of school hours.\n\nRelocated schools: Several schools had to relocate after the fire, including Eliot Arts Magnet Academy and Altadena Arts Magnet Elementary.

Clinicians strive to avert these boarding outcomes by expanding access to mental health support through innovative strategies, Funda Bachini, MD, division chief of psychiatry at Phoenix Children’s, told Becker’s.\n\nPhoenix Children’s serves more than 278,000 patients annually. Its behavioral health sector offers services from outpatient counseling to inpatient care.\n\n“There are really long wait times in the community to see a psychiatrist, waiting on average six months, which is really hard,” Dr. Bachini said. “If you’re at the point where you’ve reached out to a psychiatrist, you need help now, or else you wouldn’t be reaching out.”\n\nFollowing the pandemic, Phoenix Children’s stationed psychiatric nurse practitioners in its emergency departments, allowing assessments and treatment — including medication — for children waiting for psychiatric services. At one time, there were nearly 24 children waiting for services, according to Dr. Bachini.\n\n“The need definitely outweighs the supply of providers,” she said. “That’s a national trend. We see that locally in Arizona, but it happens everywhere.”\n\nMental health therapists were also put in place so patients with psychiatric and mental health needs are seen within two hours of entering the department. The hospital has created programs across the spectrum of mental health services to address the influx of children entering emergency departments.\n\nMany treatment options include either the highest level of care — including inpatient — or outpatient services that may have a six-month waitlist.\n\nThe hospital has developed a bridge clinic that helps patients after discharge from the emergency room, psychiatric services and Suicide Prevention Program team to connect with a Phoenix Children’s health provider while plans for long-term care are formed. This “bridge” allows patients to meet with providers as needed — which is daily in some cases — and decreases the number of former bridge clinic patients returning to the emergency department.\n\n“Sometimes when you come to the emergency department, you don’t need to go inpatient, but you also can’t wait that amount of time,” Dr. Bachini said. “The bridge clinic [has] therapists and psychiatrists who can see you within one to two days and then see you at increased frequency, so you don’t have to sit around and wait in the ER and you have some sort of intervention.”", "source_domain": "www.beckersbehavioralhealth.com"}

The following cases are unrelated.\n\nOn July 31, Richard Garner III, 38, of Indianapolis, was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, followed by eight years of supervised release, after pleading guilty to possession with intent to distribute 40 grams or more of a substance containing fentanyl and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\n\nAccording to court documents, on August 8, 2024, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. (IMPD) Officers initiated a traffic stop on Garner after he ran a red light at Keystone Avenue and English Avenue in Indianapolis. Garner ignored the police and fled at a high rate of speed through a neighborhood, throwing a loaded Glock .40 handgun out of the car, and eventually stopping in a traffic jam on Hoyt Avenue.\n\nOfficers searched Garner’s vehicle and located 55 fentanyl pills, powder cocaine, and over $9,000 in cash. The same day, investigators searched Garner’s home and found over 1,000 M30 fentanyl pills, powder fentanyl, powder cocaine, various pills, digital scales, pill presses, as well as a loaded Ruger handgun, an AR-15-style rifle, ammunition, a machine gun conversion device, and $11,550.00 in cash. In total, Garner was in possession of 244 grams of fentanyl and 470 grams of cocaine.\n\nOn August 5, Andres Hernandez-Alamar, 29, of Indianapolis, was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, after pleading guilty to attempted possession with intent to distribute controlled substances.\n\nAccording to court documents, on May 20, 2022, IMPD detectives were alerted to a U.S. Postal Service package containing 1,165 grams of fentanyl addressed to a residence in Indianapolis. Hernandez-Alamar was found at the residence and denied knowledge of the package. However, during a search of his phone, investigators located the parcel’s tracking number and text messages between Hernandez-Alamar and a Mexican phone number in which he ordered and discussed the drugs.\n\n“The fentanyl epidemic continues to claim lives across our country, and those who profit from its distribution will be held accountable,” said Tom Wheeler, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana. “Thanks to the outstanding work of our law enforcement partners, two dangerous individuals are now off the streets of Indianapolis and no longer able to threaten the safety of our community.”\n\n“Every dose of fentanyl distributed has the potential to destroy a life and leave a family shattered.

The FBI stands with those families and, along with our law enforcement partners, remains unwavering in our mission to stop the flow of this deadly drug into our communities.”\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and IMPD investigated these cases.

The recovery process has been completed for all servers at the corporate data center and connectivity has been re-established for all U.S.-based inpatient facilities.\"\n\n\"Our major information systems such as the electronic medical record (EMR) were not directly impacted,\" officials said in a statement. \"W2e are in the process of restoring connections to these systems and back-loading data from the past week.\"\n\n\"More than half of our Acute Care hospitals are live already or scheduled to be live by the end of today,\" they added. \"UHS has deployed a significant number of IT and clinical resources to the hospitals, to support the resumption of online operations. The go-lives will continue on a rolling basis; in the meantime, those working toward go-live are continuing to use their established back-up processes including offline documentation methods.\"\n\nHackers launched the cyberattack around 2AM Sunday, September 27, which prompted a number of staff members and clinicians from around the country to take to Reddit to determine the scope of the attack. The thread detailed outages to computer systems, phone services, the internet, and data centers.\n\nSome hospitals diverted ambulances during the initial stages of the attack, and some lab test results were delayed. According to staff, the attack began shutting down systems in the emergency department and proliferating across the network. Staff took screenshots of the incident and confirmed it was ransomware. The notorious Ryuk variant is suspected.\n\nUHS officials reported the incident as an IT disruption the following day and has since updated the notification to confirm it was a malware cyberattack.\n\n“All systems were quickly disconnected, and the network was shut down in order to prevent further propagation,” officials explained in the statement. “The UHS IT Network is in the process of being restored and applications are being reconnected.”\n\n“The recovery process has been completed for all servers at the corporate data center. All US-based inpatient facilities have connectivity established back to the corporate data center and are in process of securely connecting to those systems,” they added.\n\nOfficials also noted that the electronic medical record was not directly impacted by the ransomware, nor were the UK-based sites. The restoration efforts are focused on the connections to the EMR system. Clinicians are continuing to operate under back-up processes, including offline documentation methods.\n\nPatient care is safely and effectively continuing amid the recovery efforts, officials added. The notification did not detail the ransomware variant, nor when the recovery efforts would conclude. A Coveware report showed ransomware attacks spur 15 days of EHR downtime, on average.\n\nThis story has been updated with the latest UHS recovery efforts.\n\nMU Health Care Reports Phishing Attack Impacting 189K For the second time in just a year, the University of Missouri Health Care reported that a phishing attack has caused a data breach, impacting 189,736 patients. In 2019, MU Health Care reported two employee email accounts were hacked for more than a week between April 23 and May 1, 2019, which compromised the data of 14,000 patients. The hacker was able to gain access to a trove of data, including health insurance details, clinical and treatment information, and some Social Security numbers. The breach victims soon filed a lawsuit. The latest breach was caused by a successful phishing attack, which occurred between May 4 and May 6. And much like its last breach notification, the provider is yet again notifying patients far beyond the HIPAA-required timeframe of 60 days between the discovery of the breach and patient notifications. The investigation into the cyberattack concluded on August 28 and found the hacker could have potentially accessed the data contained in the accounts, including names, dates of birth, medical record or patient account numbers, health insurance information, and or limited clinical or treatment data, such as diagnostics, prescriptions, and procedure information. Some Social Security numbers were also compromised. Those patients will receive free credit monitoring and identity protection services. In response to this latest breach, MU Health Care has implemented additional security enhancements to its email environment and reinforced staff security training. Notably, the notification does not specify whether it will update its email policies in regard to storing patient data in its email accounts.\n\nOaklawn Hospital Phishing Attack Impacts 27K Patients Michigan-based Oaklawn Hospital recently notified 26,861 patients that their data was potentially breached after a two-day phishing attack in April. The provider did not disclose when the attack was first discovered. The investigation concluded on July 28, finding the attackers gained access to multiple email accounts after employees responded to phishing emails with their credentials. The review found the accounts contained a range of patient information, including medical data, health insurance details, and dates of birth. For a limited number of patients, Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, and financial account information was compromised. Further, the provider explained the delay in notification was caused by the extensive manual document review of each impacted email account. Oaklawn has since implemented multi-factor authentication, among other cybersecurity measures.\n\nRansomware Hackers Hit eResearchTechnology Cybercriminals have successfully launched a ransomware attack against eResearchTechnology, a health tech firm working on COVID-19 clinical trials, according to an exclusive New York Times report. First discovered by employees who were locked out of their data, the attack lasted for about two weeks and slowed some of those trials. Officials stressed the clinical trial patients were not at risk, but trial researchers were forced to track data with pen and paper as the IT team worked to recover the systems. The attack impacted some clinical trials, including IQVIA, the contract research firm managing the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial and Bristol Myers Squibb, the drug manufacturer leading several companies in the development of a faster COVID-19 test. ERT did not disclose how many trials were affected by the event. On Friday, some systems were back online, and officials said they predict the remaining systems will be brought online within the next few days. Federal agencies and security researchers have repeatedly warned that hackers are targeting COVID-19 data. Threat actors have launched attacks against the World Health Organization and have successfully attacked several COVID-19 research firms in recent months. A July report from BitSight found many biomedical, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and other academic research firms publicly working on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are operating on systems with known security issues and other vulnerabilities.", "source_domain": "www.techtarget.com"}
{"url": "https://www.kff.org/mental-health/a-look-at-substance-use-and-mental-health-treatment-facilities-across-the-u-s/", "title": "A Look at Substance Use and Mental Health Treatment Facilities Across the U.S.", "published_at": "2024-02-02T13:53:51+00:00", "full_text": "A Look at Substance Use and Mental Health Treatment Facilities Across the U.S. Print Email Copy Link\n\nMost Americans (90%) think we are in the midst of a mental health crisis, and trends in data support these opinions. Provisional data from 2022 indicate record numbers of suicides and drug overdose deaths—marking substantial growth in both over the past decade. Despite the escalation of mental health needs and the increasing and evolving opioid epidemic, accessing treatment continues to be difficult–as indicated by consumer surveys and national data. Factors like the decline in psychiatric beds, financing barriers, difficulty accessing outpatient treatment, and the growing workforce shortages have led to more reports of unmet needs and psychiatric boarding in emergency departments. This issue may be particularly acute among certain groups needing targeted care, such as youth and adolescents. Given that a growing number of youth and over one-third of US adults have mental health or substance use conditions (half of which are moderate or severe) there will likely continue to be discussions aimed at aligning treatment infrastructure, workforce, and financing to meet the outpatient and intensive needs of this population. Further, the effectiveness of the recently launched 988 hotline and crisis services may depend on the availability of a robust behavioral health infrastructure that allows crisis workers to link people into care, including outpatient care and more intensive services.\n\nThis brief uses 2022 data from the National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS). The N-SUMHSS is an annual survey sent to all substance use and mental health treatment facilities to assess the supply and characteristics of these facilities at a national and state level. Key N-SUMHSS indicators are available at a national and state level on KFF State Health Facts (SHF).\n\nNumber of facilities and beds\n\nSubstance use and mental health treatment facilities vary in their settings and services. Some provide hospital inpatient care, involving overnight stays and medical monitoring, and others offer outpatient services where patients visit for treatment sessions but do not stay overnight. Facilities sometimes provide multiple types of care; for example, a residential facility might also offer outpatient care. Most facilities typically specialize in either mental health or substance use treatment, but about 15% specialize in both. Consumer difficulties in accessing care have been linked to a shortage or uneven distribution of facilities and beds, and although these facility shortages are acknowledged as contributing factors, there is no established consensus or best practices for estimating bed needs. In this report, and for KFF SHF indicators, substance use and mental health facilities are reported separately to give a detailed state-level look at treatment settings and characteristics. Types of care provided at facilities are typically grouped into the following categories:\n\nOutpatient care is usually less intensive treatment, typically consisting of sessions that last 3 hours or less and take place 1 or 2 days per week.\n\nis usually less intensive treatment, typically consisting of sessions that last 3 hours or less and take place 1 or 2 days per week. Partial Hospitalization or Day Treatment is a form of outpatient treatment that is typically less intensive than residential care, but more intensive than outpatient. It typically occurs over 3 hours a day and more than 2 days a week and can sometimes be an alternative to inpatient or residential care services.\n\nis a form of outpatient treatment that is typically less intensive than residential care, but more intensive than outpatient. It typically occurs over 3 hours a day and more than 2 days a week and can sometimes be an alternative to inpatient or residential care services. Residential care is typically provided outside of hospitals and can involve longer overnight stays with supervised living and supportive services. Its intensity varies but it is considered a higher level of care than outpatient, typically reserved for those with more acute needs.\n\nis typically provided outside of hospitals and can involve longer overnight stays with supervised living and supportive services. Its intensity varies but it is considered a higher level of care than outpatient, typically reserved for those with more acute needs. Inpatient care involves overnight hospital stays with medical management or monitoring, typically for emergency situations or cases needing intensive medical supervision.\n\nOverall, there are approximately 14,700 facilities providing substance use treatment services and about 9,500 facilities that offer mental health services. This data primarily reflects registered facilities and may not include smaller practices or solo practitioners that provide substance use or mental health treatment services. Additionally, the data might not include facilities that provide treatment in settings or physician practices not specifically registered as substance use or mental health treatment facilities. For instance, general practitioners prescribing antidepressants in primary care settings that are not dedicated to mental health or substance use treatment may not be reflected in this data.\n\nMore than eight in ten substance use treatment facilities and mental health facilities provide outpatient services; smaller shares offer more intensive inpatient services. The American Academy of Addiction Medicine categorizes substance use treatment into levels of care, ranging from screening and less intensive outpatient services to the most intensive, medically managed inpatient services. Nationally, 83% of substance use treatment facilities offer outpatient care, 24% offer residential care, and 7% offer inpatient care. About 81% of mental health facilities offer outpatient services, which are less intense than higher levels of care—like 24-hour hospital inpatient or 24-hour residential services. The availability and type of treatment services vary by state. In some cases, states with a lower share of one type of intense treatment will be offset by a higher share of facilities offering a different type of higher intensity treatment.\n\nSubstance use treatment and mental health bed availability varies across states. Nationally, substance use treatment beds average 34 beds per 100,000 and mental health beds average 29 beds per 100,000 people. These rates include both residential and outpatient beds. Across states, substance use treatment beds range from a low of 8 beds up to 79 beds per 100,000 people, and approximately one-third of states have less than 25 beds per 100,000 people for substance use treatment. For mental health treatment, the number of mental health treatment beds ranges from 14 beds to 69 beds per 100,000 people.\n\nOwnership models\n\nFacilities operate under different ownership models, including private for-profit, non-profit, and public or government ownership. These ownership models may influence facility management, including in areas such as staffing decisions and types of services offered, which can in turn affect the quality of care and patient outcomes. Ownership models have received particular attention in recent years due to the growth of for-profit private equity firms acquiring healthcare practices, which some research has linked to changes in quality and outcomes. There is increasing evidence that for-profit ownership in certain behavioral health facilities is growing, and private equity firms are showing greater interest in and acquiring more behavioral health facilities.\n\nMost substance use and mental health treatment facilities are non-profit; however, for-profit ownership is more common among substance use treatment facilities, whereas public ownership is more common among mental health facilities. The share of for-profit substance use treatment facilities was double that of mental health facilities (43% compared to 19%) while the share of public or government-owned mental health facilities was double compared to substance use treatment (18% compared to 9%). For substance use treatment facilities, about 48% of facilities operate under non-profit ownership models and 43% operate under for-profit ownership models. Additionally, about 9% of substance use treatment facilities are owned and operated by a government or public agency. In health care, more broadly, hospitals have a 24% for-profit, 58% non-profit, and 18% government ownership distribution, a pattern that aligns closely with mental health facility ownership distribution but diverges from the ownership distribution of substance use treatment facilities.\n\nNotably, the distribution of ownership type varies substantially at a state level. For-profit ownership ranges from 10% in Alaska to 75% in Idaho. Among mental health treatment facilities, 63% are non-profit, while 19% are for-profit, and government or public agencies own about 18% of these facilities. At a state level, government or public ownership itself varies across states, from a low of 2% in Maine up to 82% in South Carolina.\n\nParticipation with insurers\n\nSubstance use and mental health treatment facilities choose to participate with specific insurance types and health plans, which directly impacts patient access to services. Most patients cannot afford to pay for care out-of-pocket and rely on health insurance, making the acceptance of their insurance a key factor in access to care. Medicaid enrollees may be particularly affected, as they often have behavioral health conditions coupled with low incomes, making out-of-pocket payments unfeasible. However, a facility’s stated insurance participation doesn’t always guarantee access. Some facilities might not accept new patients or may limit the number they accept based on their insurance type, such as Medicare or Medicaid, which may offer lower payment rates for care than private insurance.\n\nMost facilities report high participation with private insurance and Medicaid, but lower for Medicare and there is variation across states. Smaller shares of facilities report participation with Tricare or Indian Health Service. Nationally, 41% of substance use treatment facilities and 46% of mental health treatment facilities report participation with federal military insurance (such as Tricare), and 12% of substance use treatment facilities and 8% of mental health treatment facilities indicate acceptance of Indian Health Service/Tribal/Urban funds. However, since these payers represent a much smaller share of overall coverage and payments and there is considerable geographic variation in populations covered by these insurance types, these data are not shown in the figure. Across payer types, these data show the facility’s reported participation, but this might not be an accurate measure of access, as some facilities may not take new patients or limit the number of patients by payer (like Medicare or Medicaid).\n\nNotably, 5% of substance use treatment facilities operate on a self-pay basis only, not participating in any insurance.\n\nReported Medicaid participation by substance use treatment facilities varies across states. In thirteen states, less than 70% of the state’s substance use treatment facilities report participation in Medicaid. Conversely, 16 states report that 90% or more of their substance use treatment facilities participate in Medicaid. The share of mental health treatment facilities reporting Medicaid participation is generally higher than for substance use treatment facilities. There may be a number of factors that affect the variation in Medicaid participation rates across states, including varying rules around Medicaid reimbursement for residential and inpatient care provided in facilities considered “Institutions of Mental Disease.”\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSubstance use and mental health treatment facilities vary in the services they offer, their ownership structures, and the insurance plans in which they participate. These differences may be influenced by the unique policies in each state and the specific needs of their populations. Currently, there’s no agreement on the ideal mix of these factors for these facilities, but wide reports of difficulty accessing care fuel policy conversations in this area. As understanding grows and new delivery methods and standards are introduced, the types of services and characteristics of these facilities may also change. For example, implementation of 988 and a robust crisis response system may reduce reliance on inpatient psychiatric facilities. Access to services not only relies on the availability of facilities and beds but also on the presence of a behavioral health workforce to keep facilities operational and to provide treatment services.", "source_domain": "www.kff.org"}

Brightline’s Florida service is the only private passenger rail service in the U.S. Though it’s not technically high-speed, its next project, from L.A. to Vegas, will be. The company has steered past some of the biggest hurdles that rail ventures have faced for decades, and if it’s successful, the new line could inspire other companies to follow suit, toward finally building a high-speed network around America. But it remains to be seen if American customers, so used to traveling by car, will eagerly adopt mass transit. Brightline’s Florida service map. [Image: Brightline] Since 2018, Brightline’s Florida service has operated from West Palm Beach, south to Downtown Miami, taking the 70-mile route in 75 minutes, passing through hubs like Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale. In September, a long-awaited route will open from Miami to Orlando, linking the beaches and bustle to the theme park capital and the home of Mickey Mouse. Florida attracts more than 130 million tourists a year, many of whom are international and used to train travel. And for convenience, the Orlando station will be inside the airport’s new terminal.\n\nSubscribe to the Daily newsletter.

For its tourism and business opportunities, as well as its massive population, Florida was the natural state for Brightline to fulfill its “proof of concept” of a rail alternative. “It makes sense to fish where the fish are,” Reininger says. [Photo: Brightline] The route allowed the company to evade what Reininger views as the two biggest hurdles rail companies face in the U.S. Brightline built directly along existing highway corridors, avoiding the need to purchase new land. The alternative is usually a jigsaw puzzle of patching pieces of land together from different owners. “One holdout and you have a gap,” he says. “If you have a gap, you don’t have a right of way.” And, because it’s already a functioning corridor, the company has secured the necessary environmental permits, sidestepping another major holdup. The area’s alternative transport options are onerous. Weather and traffic can turn a two-hour drive into four, and South Florida roads are notoriously dangerous. “I-95 is one of the most challenging drives anywhere in the United States,” Reininger says. According to data, a portion of I-95 in Fort Lauderdale is the deadliest one-mile interstate stretch in the country.\n\nBut even though the line is a boon to the area, a high speed train would be key to truly expediting those journeys. High-speed rail is generally agreed to be more than 155 mph, but the service in Florida doesn’t hit the mark, traveling at 79 mph in South Florida, and 125 to Orlando. “It’s too slow,” says Harry Teng, a railroad engineering professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “It’s not high-speed rail at all.” (My Fort Lauderdale-to-Miami trip was 35 minutes, which can be done in about the same amount of time on a good road day.) In Florida, that may be fine, because the unique conditions make driving so hard. “The speed matters a lot,” says Seth Moulton, a Democratic congressman in Massachusetts. “But because traffic is so bad in southern Florida, they’ve been able to get a good number of passengers going at very conventional speeds.” In other markets, that might not cut it. The planned Las Vegas station. [Rendering: Brightline West] High speeds, low funding Out west, the ride will be fast. If Florida is the company’s proof of concept, Brightline West is the prototype. It’ll similarly connect two popular hubs, Los Angeles and the adult Disney, Las Vegas. The 100%-electric train, running at starting speeds of 186 mph, is due for completion in late 2027 or early 2028, in time for the L.A. Olympics. It’s a much bigger project, but again runs along the existing I-15 corridor.\n\nThe route is a historical one. In the 1970s, Amtrak offered a weekend service between the two cities that came to be known as the Crapshooters Express, or the Las Vegas Fun Train, at times with live music, poker, and booze. [Image: Brightline West] There’s still demand for that route, says Teng, who’s also the Commissioner of the Nevada High Speed Rail Authority, where he’s tasked with monitoring and facilitating the project’s progress. He notes that on weekends, cars pile up along the whole stretch, and he estimates that rail could divert 60% to 70% of that traffic. “This is the demand that makes this high-speed rail profitable,” he says. Moulton, the congressman, has been a long-time proponent of high-speed rail, particularly noting its climate benefits: Train travel produces 83% fewer carbon emissions than driving. He says Brightline West is promising, and hopes people don’t view it as a one-off just because it’s Vegas, with its own unique market. “There are a lot of corridors all over America that have similar characteristics,” he says, “whether or not they have a Las Vegas at one end.”\n\nBefore joining Congress, Moulton worked as managing director of Texas Central, a company that has aimed since 2009 to connect Dallas and Houston with a high-speed train. But, like several other rail projects, it has encountered the usual obstacles: land purchasing and regulation. “I think we should have environmental regulation,” Moulton says. “But when environmental regulation impedes projects that are fundamentally very good for the environment, that’s pretty counterproductive.” Moulton believes private businesses are best equipped to lead the charge on rail, because they typically overcome hurdles faster than the public sector, and provide better experiences, thanks to the “innovative and competitive culture of the private sector . . . which has been elusive for Amtrak.” Amtrak is the state-owned enterprise that has operated passenger rail service since Congress established it in 1970. It was designed to financially support private rail companies at a time when ridership had declined and companies had reduced the number of trains in service from 9,000 to 450 between 1950 and 1970.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut over the years, Amtrak hasn’t been well funded, leading to delayed services at slow speeds; the Chicago-to-Seattle route, at 46 hours, takes 50% longer than driving. Trains compete with private freight trains on the same tracks, which take priority. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill that passed in 2021 granted the biggest chunk of money to Amtrak since its founding—$66 billion—to bolster tunnels and fix crumbling bridges, largely in the Northeast, where the majority of its ridership takes place. Parts of its Acela route are already high-speed, reaching up to 150 mph, and it has plans use some separate funding to accelerate that to 160 mph in New Jersey. But Moulton says even private rail companies need public funding, because the government heavily subsidizes the competition—road and air. Rail needs the same capital to have a fair shot. “A relatively minor commitment would leverage a tremendous amount of private-sector capital, and you would get [projects] done,” he says. “This doesn’t have to be just more taxes. It has to be a better use of taxpayer resources.” Brightline is hoping to dig into some of these public resources. The entire Florida project, which cost $6 billion, was funded via private equity and municipal bonds. But Brightline West will cost twice that. The company plans to finance it in mostly the same way, but has also applied for a Federal-State Partnership Program grant of $3.75 billion, as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. If all goes to plan, they’re in a position to break ground by the end of the year.\n\n[Photo: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images] Short-term snags, long-term goals Even for a company that has navigated the traditional obstacles, there have been some bumps along the ride. Brightline West won’t go directly to Downtown Los Angeles, rather Rancho Cucamonga, 40 miles east, leaving riders headed for the city with the choice of an extra commuter train journey, or figuring out a car ride. (Several other connecting transit options are also planned in advance of the Olympics.) And after complaints from conservation groups that the track would cut across wildlife habitats, the company has agreed to build a number of crossings for bighorn sheep, and fencing to protect desert tortoises. Most pressingly, since testing began in 2017, there have been at least 88 reported deaths connected to the South Florida line. A Brightline spokesperson says none were due to operations, rather mostly related to drivers circumventing safety devices, while half have been suicides. In partnership with state and federal departments of transportation, Brightline says it has invested millions of dollars toward fencing, landscaping, and crossing gate enhancements. Then, there’s the challenging task ahead: convincing an American audience, historically attached to the automobile and the freedom it symbolizes, that they should take the train. Unlike the Northeast, where most of Amtrak’s ridership occurs, Brightline’s markets like Florida and California are reliant on cars, and will need some behavior changes.\n\n[Rendering: Brightline West] But that blank slate is a benefit, Reininger says. Consumers don’t have an expectation for train travel, so Brightline is molding a rail experience for novice riders. “We specifically built a product that was meant to appeal to the expectations of an American consumer, who, generally speaking, has very high expectations about everything,” Reininger says. “If you’re starting from zero, you don’t have to undo anything that may have been established.” Hence: the ride experience with the amenities. On board, there are attendants offering food and beverage service, similar to a plane; at stations, there are stylish bars and lounges for premium passengers. Reininger says the facilities tackle the precise pain points that people say they detest on car rides—such as the “ick factor” of stopping at a roadside McDonald’s to use a restroom. Brightline’s clean, hands-free bathrooms feel infinitely more palatable. Snack service aboard a Brightline train in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. [Photo: Jeffrey Greenberg/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images] “They’ve got a great experience,” says Wayne Rogers, CEO of Northeast Maglev, another rail company planning to build high-speed rail between Northeastern cities using Japanese electromagnetic tech—initially with a Baltimore-to-D.C. route in 15 minutes.\n\nBrightline is already seeing consumer demand. In the first full year, 2019, they carried about a million people in South Florida, Reininger says. In 2022 year, the first year post-COVID, they carried 1.35 million, a 35% increase in ridership; they’re on track for 2 million this year. The company is confident that after riding the train once, passengers will repeat rides, and encourage others to try it. That could be a benefit to the other rail projects, not just from Brightline. One day, they could form a larger U.S. network, probably in the form of city pairings around the country: Orlando and Miami; L.A. and Vegas; Dallas and Houston; New York and D.C.; Atlanta and Charlotte; Seattle and Portland. In that sense, the companies don’t view themselves as direct competitors, rather complementary to each other. “We cheer [Brightline] on everyday,” Rogers says. “We hope they’re successful.”", "source_domain": "www.fastcompany.com"}

Her scans were clear. Her doctors were pleased. But Rachel still struggled with lingering fatigue, joint pain, and a sense that her treatment story was being measured by numbers that didn't fully reflect her reality.\n\nHer experience isn't uncommon. For many breast cancer patients, surviving the disease is only one part of the journey. The other part, living fully after treatment, is often overlooked in clinical trials. According to Dr. Sud Agarwal, CEO of iNGENū CRO, that gap in focus is long overdue for change.\n\nRedefining Success in Breast Cancer Trials\n\nFor decades, breast cancer research has relied heavily on metrics like overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) to evaluate treatment success. These measures remain essential. But as treatments become more effective and long-term survival improves, they're no longer enough on their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Living longer is important,\" says Dr. Agarwal. \"But what's equally important is how patients are living.\"\n\nThat's why iNGENū CRO, based in Australia, is pushing for trial designs that go beyond tumor response. Their studies consider broader outcomes—such as quality of life, functional ability, and emotional wellbeing that can better reflect how treatments impact a patient's daily life.\n\nA Complex Disease Needs Nuanced Research\n\nBreast cancer is not one condition but many. It includes hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive, and triple-negative subtypes, each with distinct behaviors and treatment responses. Modern diagnostic codes, like those in ICD-11, now capture this diversity.\n\nBut recognizing these subtypes isn't enough, Dr. Agarwal says. Trials must also be designed with this complexity in mind. Without careful stratification, data from patients with vastly different disease profiles can blur important results.\n\n\"We can't afford one-size-fits-all research,\" he notes. \"Precision medicine starts with precision in trial design.\"\n\nClosing the Gaps in Clinical Trial Design\n\nDespite years of progress, many trials still leave blind spots unaddressed. Underrepresentation of women from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds is a persistent issue. Inconsistent biomarker validation and poor adherence tracking also compromise the accuracy of results.\n\nDr. Agarwal points out that high dropout rates are especially common in long-term breast cancer trials. \"If we're not supporting patients through the full course of treatment, we're not getting the full picture of how effective it really is,\" he says.\n\nTo help fix this, iNGENū CRO incorporates digital tools that track patient adherence and uses centralized imaging standards to ensure data consistency.\n\nLearning from Setbacks\n\nNot all research ends in success. Drugs like iniparib and bazedoxifene fell short of expectations during clinical trials. But those so-called failures have value.\n\nFailed studies often shed light on why a treatment didn't work—whether it was a dosing issue, an overly broad patient population, or a poorly chosen endpoint. These lessons, Dr. Agarwal says, are vital for refining future protocols.\n\n\"Every study tells us something,\" he says. \"Even when outcomes fall short, the insights are what push the field forward.\"\n\nSmarter Endpoints for a Smarter Future\n\niNGENū's research incorporates a wide range of measures beyond traditional survival rates. These include disease-free survival (DFS), time to progression (TTP), duration of response (DoR), and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nIn neoadjuvant studies, for example, early indicators like pathological complete response (pCR) can help determine whether a treatment is worth pursuing further. These kinds of surrogate endpoints have already played a role in expediting access to HER2-targeted therapies.\n\nDr. Agarwal emphasizes the importance of these newer measures. \"We need to evaluate not just how a treatment performs in a lab, but how it works in real life,\" he says.\n\nMaking Safety a Priority\n\nModern therapies have improved outcomes dramatically. But side effects remain a serious concern. HER2-targeting agents, for instance, can affect heart function. Hormone therapies may trigger joint pain, mood changes, or bone density loss.\n\nThat's why Dr. Agarwal stresses the importance of integrating safety into every stage of research. From cardiac screening before enrollment to long-term quality-of-life monitoring, a proactive approach is essential.\n\n\"Supportive care is part of the treatment, not something separate from it,\" he says.\n\nBuilding a Better Research Model\n\nWith survival rates improving, the next frontier in breast cancer research is making sure patients also thrive. That means shifting how trials are designed, what they measure, and who they include.\n\nFor Dr. Sud Agarwal and the team at iNGENū CRO, the mission is clear: build trials that reflect the lives of the people they're meant to help.\n\n\"We have better data and better tools than ever before,\" he says. \"Now we need to build better questions—and better answers—for the future of breast cancer care.\"\n\nOriginal Publication: https://www.youthhealthmag.com/articles/53798/20250804/rethinking-breast-cancer-trials-a-clinical-perspective-from-dr-sud-agarwal-ceo-of-ingen%C5%AB-cro.htm", "source_domain": "vocal.media"}

(Faster than even Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo could drive their car along the same route.)\n\nThe program is the “Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail” grant program, a high-profile part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).\n\nBy USDOT grant program standards, four of the ten grants being announced today are enormous, with the rest being in the range that other programs have provided in the past.\n\nThe biggest grant is $3.1 billion to the California High Speed Rail Authority to help fulfill Governor Gavin Newsom’s interim vision of an operational high-speed line between Merced and Bakersfield. The money will go towards part of the cost of extending the Initial Construction Segment (the part funded by the Obama Administration 13 years ago) northward from Madera (pop. 66,224) to Merced (pop. 86,333) and southward from Shafter (pop. 16,988) into Bakersfield proper (pop. 403,455), and electrifying track and buying actual trainsets. (As a separate article in this issue notes, this $3.1 billion still leaves CHSRA several billion dollars short of being able to finish the Merced-Bakersfield section, much less go anywhere near San Francisco or Los Angeles.)\n\nAfter the aforementioned $3.0 billion Brightline project, the next-largest grant is $1.1 billion for an early part of a much more expensive attempt to bring passenger rail service from Raleigh, NC to Richmond, VA. This grant is just to upgrade existing CSX track between Raleigh and Wake Forest. The real problem, as the map provided by sponsors shows, is on the Virginia side of the state line, where there is no existing, operational track.\n\nThe fourth large grant, $729 million, goes to improve passenger rail immediately to south of the nation’s capital down to Richmond, VA. The centerpiece is the replacement of the Long Bridge across the Potomac (parallel and adjacent to the 14th Street Bridge/I-395 complex), but it also includes improvements at L’Enfant Plaza’s VRE station and extra sidings near Woodbridge, Brooke, and Spotsylvania, VA.\n\nCA California High-Speed Rail (Merced-Bakersfield) $3,073,600,000 NV-CA Brightline West (Las Vegas – Rancho Cucamonga) $3,000,000,000 NC Raleigh-to-Richmond (Raleigh – Wake Forest) $1,095,576,000 DC-VA DC-Richmond Phase 2 $729,000,000 PA Keystone West (Pittsburgh-Harrisburg) $143,629,028 IL Chicago Union Station Mail Platform Reactivation $49,600,000 IL Chicago Union Station Platform Capacity Expansion $44,000,000 ME-NH Downeaster Corridor (New Brunswick-MA State Line) $27,492,000 MT Empire Builder improvements in Malta, MT $14,900,000 AK Alaska Railroad Milepost 190.5 Bridge Replacement $8,200,558 TOTAL $8,185,997,586\n\nAll grants are for 80 percent of a project’s costs, except possibly for the Virginia DC-Richmond project, where the grant notification was phrased confusingly.\n\nBecause the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for this program was published in December 2022, when only the first two years of IIJA-guaranteed funding were available, the three largest grants announced today use “contingent commitment authority” – part of the grant money being announced today comes from the fiscal 2023 and 2024 appropriations, but money is also pledged from the 2024 IIJA appropriation (which was not yet available when the NOFO was released but is now) and the 2025 and 2026 IIJA appropriations (which will not become available until October 1, 2024 and October 1, 2025, respectively).\n\nWhere the money came from and how much remains\n\nThe IIJA provided an astounding $36 billion for the Federal -State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail program over five years, divided into five equal annual tranches of $7.2 billion each, with the restriction that no more than two-thirds of the funding go towards projects on the Northeast Corridor.\n\nThis being the Biden Administration, and the NEC being where most rail passengers are, the Administration decided to give the NEC the entire two-thirds of the program, so that’s $24 billion on the NEC and $12 billion off.\n\nAfter oversight and corridor development set-asides, $4.464 billion per year was available for NEC projects and $2.232 billion per year for off-NEC projects.\n\n$7,200m per Year (x5 years) 2/3 on NEC 1/3 off NEC Per Year: 4,800 2,400 Minus 5% for Corridor Development -240 -120 Minus 2% for Oversight -96 -48 Remainder for FSP Grants 4,464 2,232\n\nCongress also appropriated $100 million in each of fiscal 2022 and 2023, which the Administration could split between NEC and off-NEC up to 55%-45% (after the 7% in set-asides).\n\nHere’s how the NEC funding, announced November 6, was split between on-hand and future IIJA funding:\n\nFor the NEC, the Administration announced $16,434 billion in grants, $9.0 billion from money already in-hand at the time the NOFO was published and $7.4 billion in contingent commitments of guaranteed funding from the last three years of the IIJA, which left $6.0 billion in future IIJA funding to go on the NEC.\n\nBut the November 6 announcement also pledged $5.8 billion in “letters of intent” for future projects, which, depending on how you read subsection (g) of 49 U.S.C. §24911, could either be pledge against the remaining $6 billion of IIJA money or other appropriations to be made by Congerss. If it’s the former, then there is only $177 million left for more NEC projects out of the IIJA funding.\n\nNow, here’s how today’s announcement of funding is split between on-hand and future IIJA funding:\n\nNo letters of intent were mentioned in today’s announcement, so $3.06 billion in guaranteed IIJA advance appropriations is available for future off-NEC capital projects. And there may be more competition for that money because of a separate set of announcements made today.\n\nFuture corridor designations\n\nOut of that $36 billion advance appropriation in the IIJA for the FSP program, five percent $360 million) is set aside for corridor development activities under 49 U.S.C. §25101. This required local entitles to apply for intercity passenger rail corridor designation pursuant to this December 2020 NOFO, and successful applicants would then get several advantages:\n\nOfficial designation as a corridor, accompanied with a $500,000 grant (at a 100 percent federal share), to be used to develop a scope, schedule, and cost estimate for a full “service development plan” (SDP) for that corridor; Eligibility for a future “Step 2” grant out of the $360 million pot for preparation of the Service Development Plan; Eligibility for a future “Step 3” grant out of the $360 million pot for project development activities for projects on the SDP, including preliminary engineering and NEPA paperwork; and Priority in selection for the remaining $3.06 billion in off-NEC appropriations, and any future appropriations, for the FSP program, pursuant to subsection (d)(2)(A)(ii) of 49 U.S.C. §24911.\n\nAs part of today’s rollout, USDOT is announcing $500,000 corridor development Step 1 grants to 69 corridors, totaling $34.5 million. Only six are for high-speed rail and the remainder are for conventional service, either new or existing, as shown on this map:\n\nAs both the map above and the list below show, some of these corridors are only going to get significant federal investment in some alternate universe where modern monetary theory doesn’t spark inflation, but if the real point of the exercise is to spread excitement and anticipation about federal rail investment as far and wide as possible, so as to maximize the number of people begging Congress for more FRA appropriations every year, this is the kind of list you would come up with.\n\n(On the other hand, by declaring this many corridors and spreading expectations of future funding so widely, this makes it more difficult to give the California HSR project 38 percent of total off-NEC funding in future grant cycles, as happened in this one.)", "source_domain": "enotrans.org"}

I loved it!”\n\nHis anchor leg in the 4 x 100 meter freestyle relay was 46.53 seconds, which earned him a gold medal.\n\n“That was great! To get a gold medal with my relay team was very special. It’s always good to win a gold medal and to break a Championship record on that one was awesome,” Chalmers said.\n\nIn Singapore, Chalmers also won a bronze medal in the 100 meter freestyle race with a time of 47.17 seconds.\n\nLife on a farm\n\nChalmers revealed that he now lives on a farm in Adelaide Hills with his fiancée Ingie, a fellow swimmer herself.\n\n“Farm life is really good. I’ve been loving it,” he exclaimed. “It’ so good and so much fun. We are having a baby in a few days’ time, so it’s all happening for us.”\n\n“Ingie is a little over nine months pregnant, so we are in the window when the baby can come at any time,” he added.\n\n“We have to make a new YouTube on farm life,” he admitted.\n\nChalmers on his reptile collection\n\nWhen asked about his reptile collection, he responded, “Currently, I don’t have any reptiles because I am away so much and it’s too hard for my mom to have to look after everything while I’m away.”\n\n“So, I will get reptiles again eventually, but for the time being, it is just too challenging. I have eight cows on my farm now, so that’s enough animals,” he noted.\n\n50s at the next Olympic Games. “That is very exciting,” he noted. “That will prolong my swimming career, for sure. I can try to compete at the Brisbane Olympic Games in 2032… I can do the 50s and of course, I love the relays.”\n\nChalmers Swim Academy\n\nHe opened up about the Chalmers Swim Academy.\n\n“The Chalmers Swim Academy has been going really well,” he noted. “We have been able to work with a lot of swimmers around Australia and around the world, so it has been special to pass on all that knowledge and experiences I’ve had throughout my swimming career to these younger swimmers who are excited to learn.”\n\n“This weekend we are doing a couple of swim clinics locally with about 100 kids so that’s going to be a lot of fun as well, especially to be able to give back. I would love to get more representation of South Australians on the Australian team. I love it,” he said.\n\nKyle Chalmers.

I still love swimming, and I still want to have success in the pool,” he exclaimed.\n\n“So, I am excited for the next chapter of swimming, but I am also very excited for the next chapter of life such as being a father, husband and farming,” he added.\n\nChalmers on his career-defining moments\n\nChalmers feels that his biggest moments have yet to come. “That’s exciting for sure,” he admitted. “These next three years leading up to Los Angeles Olympics is what is going to define me.”\n\nBest advice he has ever been given\n\nOn the best advice he has ever been given, he disclosed, “To slow down and enjoy my moments.”\n\n“It is very easy to get caught in the Olympic bubble, and those big moments but it’s important to enjoy being at the Olympic Games, meeting people, and getting photos with Kevin Durant and the USA basketball players,” he explained.\n\n“I’m slowing down and enjoying my career while I’m in it,” he added.\n\nMental health significance\n\nOn the importance of mental health, Chalmers said, “It’s very important to me. I think you need to stay on top of your mental health to keep yourself happy and functioning.”\n\n“I know when I start to decline slightly, I have a lot of skills that I can use to get myself back on track. It is important to notice when things aren’t going right and try to get yourself back on track quickly,” he elaborated.\n\n“I try to spend time with my family and friends, and get outside to nature. Whenever that is happening, I try to be ‘Kyle Chalmers the person more’ than ‘Kyle Chalmers the athlete’,” he said about his mental health coping mechanisms.\n\nChalmers on Caeleb Dressel\n\nChalmers has nothing but respect and admiration for American swimmer Caeleb Dressel.\n\n“Caeleb is one of my very favorite swimmers, and I’ve been so lucky to have had so many great battles again him,” Chalmers said.\n\n“Hopefully, we will keep it going. We’ve had some very good races over time… and that’s what drove us so much throughout both of our careers,” he added.\n\nSuccess\n\nRegarding his definition of the word success, Chalmers said, “Success means really great father and really great husband… that’s how I will be able to define my success when I am a very old man.”\n\n“I will be able to look back on all that, and that will be more successful than the success I’ve had in the pool,” he acknowledged.\n\nMessage for his fans\n\nFor his fans and supporters, Chalmers expressed, “It takes an army. I am very grateful to have had so much support over the years. The fans continue to drive me!”\n\n“My fans are a big part of my journey… they make it all worthwhile especially when you are inspiring the next generation of people,” he concluded.\n\nAmerican track and field running legend Steve Prefontaine once said: “To give anything less than your best, is to sacrifice the gift.” Kyle Chalmers embodies this wise quote.\n\nTo learn more about Kyle Chalmers, follow him on Instagram.", "source_domain": "www.digitaljournal.com"}

The Brush Prairie facility will complement Madrona Recovery's established program in Tigard and will significantly enhance access to care for adolescents and their families throughout Washington state, the release adds.\n\n“We serve teenagers, 13 to 17, for some of the more challenging, life-threatening circumstances; things like trauma, substance use, mental health, and it’s usually pretty life altering, life concerning issues that they’re coming to us with,” said John Thornton, co-founder and CEO of Madrona Recovery. “We opened up our doors about nine years ago, and about a year and a half ago, Daybreak was a facility that is currently here. The state took their license and shut down both of their programs and, in kind of a pinch, some key folks in the state of Washington who recognized that there were serious concerns about gaps in coverage for this really, really challenging group of a population of kids. They didn’t have anywhere to turn to.”\n\nThornton said the absence of youth services of this type stretched hospital systems and juvenile justice systems.\n\n“There needed to be a quick understanding of what to do and address it,” he said. “And so we had some folks from major agencies, so Healthcare Authority and DOH (Department of Health), as well as key legislators who work in the realm of behavioral health, they came down, they asked us a bunch of questions about the work we do, what it would take to kind of lift this back up in meaningful ways.”\n\nThornton also stated via Madrona’s news release that the project to open in Brush Prairie is a powerful demonstration of bipartisan leadership in the Washington Legislature.\n\n“We extend our deepest gratitude to Rep. Lisa Callan for securing the necessary funds, and to Rep. Monica Stonier, Sen. Paul Harris, Rep. Stephanie McClintock and Sen. Annette Cleveland, whose dedicated work for years has been pivotal in bringing critical teen residential behavioral health services back to Washington,\" Thornton said in the release.\n\nMadrona Recovery views its role in recovery as a partnership with youth, their families and their communities, the release adds. Programming at the Brush Prairie facility is meticulously designed with a focus on comprehensive curricula, trauma-informed services and seamless intake and aftercare processes to ensure meaningful continuity of care, the release states.\n\n“What our job is here now is to do a good job stabilizing kids in a short amount of time and get kids back home,” Thornton said. “Our length of stay is about 32 to 37 days, somewhere in that range is our average. So we want kids to get stable. … Our hope is to not institutionalize kids but get them a good plan to get them stable and go home. And I think that resonates very well and now our job is to carry out that mission and do it well.”\n\nYouth and their caregivers will benefit from the support of Madrona Recovery's interdisciplinary treatment team model that consists of child psychiatrists, mental health therapists, substance use disorder counselors, case managers and front-line staff trained in trauma-informed approaches to working with youth, the release states.\n\n“The new Brush Prairie facility represents a vital new resource for the region, addressing a critical gap in services for a vulnerable population,” the release stated. “Madrona Recovery is proud to expand its commitment to keeping young people safe and supporting them on their path to long-term success.”\n\nMadrona’s Brush Prairie facility will be able to house up to 45 kids and will have approximately 150 staff.

{"url": "https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/fentanyl-transnational-vector-violence", "title": "Fentanyl: The transnational vector of violence", "published_at": null, "full_text": "The US opioid crisis, and particularly the rise of fentanyl, has profoundly reshaped global criminal dynamics, yet its international violent repercussions remain underexplored. As Aklin et al. (2023) document, fentanyl has disrupted supply chains and introduced new strategic incentives for transnational criminal organisations. Prior research shows how shocks to the US drug market reverberate in Mexico: cocaine shortages have intensified cartel violence (Castillo et al. 2020), and the decline of the heroin market has altered incentives in opium-producing regions (De Haro 2025). Some studies also examine how drug-related violence affects labour markets and firm behaviour (e.g. Utar 2021). Yet, surprisingly, the most consequential transformation – the explosion of fentanyl consumption since 2013 – has not been systematically linked to cartel violence in Mexico.\n\nOur paper (López Cruz and Torrens 2025) fills this gap, showing how fentanyl trafficking triggered a second, geographically distinct wave of homicides, driven by an external demand shock originating in the US. Figure 1 shows a two-wave trajectory of drug-related violence in Mexico. The first wave was sparked by the Mexican war on drugs, launched in December 2006 by newly elected President Felipe Calderón. Framed as an urgent effort to reassert state control over territories dominated by drug trafficking organisations, the campaign led to the rapid militarisation of public security. Violence escalated sharply, with homicides peaking around 2011 before beginning to decline.\n\nThe second wave, beginning in 2013, coincides with the onset of the fentanyl epidemic in the US. As synthetic opioid overdoses surged north of the border, homicide rates in Mexico rose again – this time in regions that had previously remained relatively calm. The simultaneous spike in fentanyl-related deaths in the US and renewed violence in Mexico points to a new, externally driven escalation.\n\nFigure 1 Trends in homicides in Mexico and synthetic opioid overdoses in the US\n\nHow trafficking routes were reshaped\n\nUnlike the Mexican war on drugs, which was initiated by internal policy choices, the fentanyl shock was externally generated. US demand for synthetic opioids rose sharply after 2013, and Mexican drug trafficking organisations – particularly those based along the Pacific coast – adapted quickly. As Hamilton (2021) and others have noted, Chinese precursor chemicals began flowing through Pacific ports in Mexico, fuelling a shift in trafficking strategies. Instead of vying for control over traditional south-north heroin corridors – long contested since the Mexican war on drugs – Pacific drug trafficking organisations pivoted eastward, establishing new west-east routes toward the Gulf.\n\nThis reorientation reshaped Mexico’s criminal landscape. Violence surged along new fentanyl corridors, while traditional heroin routes saw a decline in homicides. The strategic redirection of trafficking operations – documented in Figure 2, which shows the locations of poppy fields, major ports, and key crossing points – had profound implications for the geography of violence.\n\nFigure 2 Key geographic features relevant to drug trafficking in Mexico\n\nTwo empirical strategies: Ports and routes\n\nTo identify the causal effect of fentanyl trafficking on violence, we leverage two quasi-natural experiments: one at the ports and one along inland routes.\n\nFirst, we exploit a geographic distinction in port exposure. Pacific deep-water ports, capable of handling international maritime trade, are directly connected to Chinese shipping routes and were disproportionately targeted by fentanyl-smuggling drug trafficking organisations. In contrast, Gulf coast ports – although also open to international trade – were largely bypassed due to their greater distance from Asia and higher transoceanic shipping costs. To isolate the fentanyl effect, we compare homicide trends in areas hosting these strategic ports across coasts. Using difference-in-differences (DiD), synthetic DiD, and triple DiD approaches, we consistently find that exposure to fentanyl trafficking increased homicide rates by approximately 15 to 18 per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nSecond, we analyse the inland diffusion of violence by modelling how drug trafficking organisations adapted their operations in response to the fentanyl shock. We construct a travel-cost index that incorporates both road distance and cartel territorial control – capturing the relative ease with which a drug trafficking organisation can move drugs from one location to another. Using this index, we solve for the optimal trafficking routes from key fentanyl entry points (Pacific ports) to US border crossings (see Figure 3 for an iconic example). The resulting simulated network reflects the most efficient west-east corridors drug trafficking organisations would likely have used to avoid rival territories and minimise operational risks.\n\nFigure 3 Example of fastest and optimal routes from the Pacific Coast to the US border\n\nBased on this model, we classify municipalities into three groups:\n\nThose affected by the 2007 Mexican war on drugs, located along traditional south-north heroin routes\n\nThose affected by fentanyl, situated along the newly identified optimal west-east corridors\n\nDoubly treated municipalities positioned at the intersection of both route systems\n\nUsing a difference-in-differences framework adapted for staggered treatment timing, we compare homicide trajectories across these groups. The results show that fentanyl-affected municipalities experienced a sharp and distinct increase in violence only after 2013, while areas affected by the war on drugs had already stabilised. Doubly treated municipalities display two clear waves of violence, consistent with sequential exposure to both shocks.\n\nResults and magnitude\n\nOur findings consistently point to a large and robust fentanyl effect. The introduction of fentanyl-related trafficking routes increased homicide rates by roughly 20 per 100,000 inhabitants – an effect more than twice the national average increase in the same period. In comparative terms, we estimate that the impact of fentanyl was at least 1.75 times greater than that of the Mexican war on drugs.\n\nThese magnitudes are substantial. Homicide increases of this scale can disrupt local economies, reduce educational attainment, and trigger displacement and migration. In many regions, fentanyl trafficking has reproduced – and in some cases exceeded – the destabilising effects of the original 2007 government crackdown.\n\nCredibility of the identification strategy\n\nWhat allows us to identify the fentanyl effect so cleanly is the exogenous origin of the shock. The reconfiguration of drug trafficking organisations’ strategies was not driven by Mexican law enforcement but by shifts in global demand and supply chains. This quasi-random nature of the treatment, combined with geographic variation in exposure, creates a credible identification strategy. We further confirm the robustness of our results through placebo tests and spatial econometric techniques that account for spillovers.\n\nThis approach builds on the logic of prior work, such as Dell (2015), who examined how political turnover diverted drug routes and reshaped violence patterns; Galiani et al. (2016, 2018), who studied how security reallocations affected criminal displacement; and López Cruz and Torrens (2023), who explored criminal diversification and spatial diffusion of violence in Mexico. But unlike those studies, we show that an international demand shock – rather than domestic policies – can significantly reshape criminal incentives and spatial conflict patterns.\n\nImplications for policy\n\nOur findings highlight the international ramifications of US drug demand and the unintended consequences of logistical adaptation by transnational criminal organisations. The rise of fentanyl created new profit opportunities for Pacific-based drug trafficking organisations, prompting a reconfiguration of trafficking routes and the ignition of new territorial disputes. This reorganisation reignited violence in areas stabilised after the Mexican war on drugs and extended conflict into regions previously untouched by drug-related violence.\n\nThe scale of the resulting escalation was large enough to reverse the national decline in homicide rates that had followed the 2011 peak of the Mexican war on drugs. From a broader perspective, both the war on drugs and the fentanyl shock triggered a similar pattern: cartels adjusted their logistics, rivalries intensified, and violence surged until a new equilibrium emerged. In this sense, externally and internally induced shocks – whether government crackdowns or shifts in global drug demand – can be equally destabilising when they alter the strategic calculus of criminal organisations. Understanding these dynamics is essential for designing interventions that limit the incentives for reoptimisation or deter escalations over newly valuable routes.\n\nThree key lessons for policymakers emerge:\n\nDrug policy is regiona l. Demand-side shocks in one country can destabilise others, particularly in criminal ecosystems where actors adapt quickly.\n\nl. Demand-side shocks in one country can destabilise others, particularly in criminal ecosystems where actors adapt quickly. Geography shapes conflict . Strategic infrastructure – such as deep-water ports and inland road corridors – plays a critical role in determining which regions bear the brunt of violence.\n\n. Strategic infrastructure – such as deep-water ports and inland road corridors – plays a critical role in determining which regions bear the brunt of violence. Violence is not only supply-driven. Even without intensified enforcement, shifts in trafficking incentives can produce sharp surges in conflict.\n\nIn sum, fentanyl has grown into more than a public health crisis: it is a vector of transnational violence. Addressing its effects will require both domestic action and international coordination that acknowledge how deeply intertwined drug markets, logistics, and violence have become.\n\nReferences\n\nAklin, M, A Dube, and S Naidu (2023), “Importing the fentanyl crisis”, VoxEU.org, 13 January.\n\nCastillo, J C, D Mejía, and P Restrepo (2020), “Scarcity without Leviathan: The violent effects of cocaine supply shortages in the Mexican drug war”, Review of Economics and Statistics 102(2): 261–76.\n\nDe Haro, I (2025), “Avocados: Mexico’s green gold, drug cartel violence and the US opioid crisis”, World Development 191: 106942.\n\nDell, M (2015), “Trafficking networks and the Mexican drug war”, American Economic Review 105(5): 1738–79.\n\nGaliani, S, I López Cruz, and G Torrens (2016), “Stirring up a hornets’ nest: Geographic distribution of crime”, VoxEU.org, 24 May.\n\nGaliani, S, I López Cruz, and G Torrens (2018), “Stirring up a hornets’ nest: Geographic distribution of crime”, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization 152: 17–35.\n\nHamilton, C K (2021), “America’s failing trade war with China: A focus on fentanyl”, American Journal of Trade and Policy 8(3): 171–82.\n\nLópez Cruz, I, and G Torrens (2023), “Hidden drivers of violence diffusion: Evidence from illegal oil siphoning in Mexico”, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization 206: 26–72.\n\nLópez Cruz, I, and G, Torrens (2025), “A two-wave death story: Fentanyl overdoses in the US, bullets in Mexico”, Journal of Development Economics, forthcoming.\n\nUtar, H (2021), “Firms and labour markets in times of violence: Evidence from the Mexican Drug War”, VoxEU.org, 28 March.", "source_domain": "cepr.org"}

The allegations centered on HCA’s enforcement of training repayment agreements (TRAs) with new nurses.\n\nThese agreements required nurses to repay training costs if they left their jobs within two years. The states’ investigation alleged that many nurses were misled regarding the terms and financial obligations of the TRAs and that HCA recruiters frequently failed to disclose these repayment requirements during the hiring process. By the time nurses learned of the TRA obligations, they had already accepted employment and were committed to their roles, leaving them with few options to avoid the financial burden. Furthermore, the TRA contracts were presented in a read-only format, preventing any negotiation or modification of terms once disclosed. In some instances, recruiters imposed deadlines for accepting job offers, further limiting the time available for nurses to inquire about employment terms and conditions. The California complaint specifically asserted that since 2018, approximately 34,500 new-graduate registered nurses (RNs) participated in the StaRN (Specialty Training Apprenticeship for Registered Nurses) Program and entered into TRAs with HCA. In California, TRAs often set a training value of $4,000, obligating RNs to repay a prorated amount if they left before completing two years of employment, with deductions potentially taken directly from their final paycheck. In Colorado, the training value was set at $10,000, significantly higher than in California, with similar repayment obligations for early departures.\n\nThe settlement concludes a joint investigation into HCA’s practices and releases the states’ claims.\n\nConsent Judgment Monetary Terms\n\nDespite denying any wrongdoing, HCA agreed to the settlement, citing the best interests of its nurses and hospitals. The California consent judgment requires HCA Healthcare to pay $1,162,900 to the California AG’s office with the amount designated for restitution and consumer protection enforcement, with funds potentially allocated to the California Victims of Consumer Fraud Restitution Fund. Additionally, HCA agreed to provide restitution to affected nurses, including refunds and adjustments for loss of use of funds, calculated using the Consumer Price Index.\n\nHCA will pay approximately $75,776 to fully reimburse Nevada nurses who made payments on their unlawful TRA provision (TRAP) debt to HCA and will also make a $786,500 penalty payment to the state of Nevada.\n\nIn Colorado, the consent judgment mandates HCA to pay at least $424,408.22 for consumer redress, with funds held in trust by the AG for various consumer protection purposes. Furthermore, HCA agreed to pay $968,600 to the Colorado AG, to be used for consumer protection and enforcement efforts.\n\nConsent Judgment Injunctive Terms\n\nThe California consent judgment permanently enjoins HCA Healthcare and its affiliates from engaging in practices related to TRAs, including advertising, marketing, collecting, and reporting to consumer agencies. It mandates that all amounts owed under TRAs during the relevant period be treated as void and invalid, requiring HCA to request consumer reporting agencies to delete any related information.\n\nSimilarly, the Colorado consent judgment imposes a permanent prohibition on HCA and its affiliates from participating in or assisting others in any activities related to TRAs, including advertising, marketing, and collecting. It also voids all TRA-related debts and requires HCA to ensure the deletion of any information furnished to consumer reporting agencies. Colorado specifically mandates that HCA maintain records for two years to demonstrate compliance and cooperate with the AG to identify affected consumers.\n\nNevada similarly prohibits HCA from imposing TRAPs on nurse employees and attempting to collect on any outstanding TRAP debt incurred by Nevada nurses who signed TRAPs with HCA. All judgments emphasize the cessation of practices deemed unfair and the protection of consumer rights through stringent injunctive measures.\n\nOur Take\n\nBy prioritizing transparency and flexibility in employment agreements, health care companies can protect their reputation, foster trust with employees, and mitigate the risk of costly legal disputes. The settlements emphasize the role of state AGs in enforcing consumer protection laws, which can have significant implications for business operations. The resolution of these cases highlights the potential legal and financial risks associated with using TRAs that may be perceived as unfair or coercive. The settlement serves as a reminder to health care companies to carefully evaluate their recruitment and employment practices to avoid similar pitfalls.\n\nTroutman Pepper Locke State Attorneys General Team", "source_domain": "www.regulatoryoversight.com"}

That charge was dismissed in September.\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said Thursday that she had completed a review of the case and made the decision to dismiss the assault and resisting arrest charges.\n\nNew body cam video released by the Phoenix Police Department is raising questions about an arrest in august where a deaf man, who also has cerebral palsy, was beaten and tased four times by police officers. NA43W AZ\n\n\"Last Friday, a leader of the local chapter of the NAACP shared his concern with me regarding the prosecution of Mr. Tyron McAlpin. I promised I would personally review the case including a large volume of video recordings, police reports, and other materials that have been forwarded to my office,\" she said in a statement. \"On Tuesday of this week, I also convened a large gathering of senior attorneys and members of the community to hear their opinions as they pertain to this case.\"\n\nMitchell continued: \"I have now completed my review and have made the decision to dismiss all remaining charges against Mr. McAlpin.\"\n\nMitchell's office and an attorney for McAlpin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.\n\nThe arrest stemmed from an incident at a Circle K convenience store on E. Indian School Road. Police responded to the store after receiving a 911 call about a fight, according to a police incident report previously provided to NBC News by McAlpin’s attorney Jesse Showalter.\n\nThe 911 caller said a white man in his 20s had been the aggressor and was still in the store, the police incident report said. Officer Benjamin Harris spoke with the man who said he had been assaulted after he tried to stop the theft of a bike, according to the incident report. The man then pointed to McAlpin, who was walking nearby, and identified him as the person who assaulted him.\n\nHarris and officer Kyle Sue pursued McAlpin in separate vehicles and stopped him in the parking lot of another store.\n\nBody camera video recently released by Showalter showed that Harris attempted to arrest McAlpin within seconds of exiting his vehicle. Harris said in his report that he did so because McAlpin didn’t respond to a verbal command to stop. Showalter said McAlpin could not comply with the commands because he is deaf.\n\nHarris alleged that after he exited his vehicle and tried to take hold of McAlpin’s arm, McAlpin \"immediately engaged in active aggression by swinging punches\" at the officer's head.\n\nDuring the arrest, one of the officers said \"tase him\" and ordered McAlpin to put his hands behind his back, the body camera video showed. Officer Sue repeatedly punched McAlpin on the head, according to the footage. While McAlpin was face down on the ground and Sue held his left hand behind his back, Harris shocked McAlpin with a Taser and yelled for him to put his hands behind his back.\n\nSue again punched McAlpin in his back, the video showed. After McAlpin was handcuffed, he could be heard making a series of noises. McAlpin's wife eventually arrived at the scene. She could be heard in the video telling the officers that her husband is deaf and has cerebral palsy.\n\nMcAlpin's attorney said Monday that the officers launched a \"frenzied and violent attack on Tyron.\" He said he had requested from police additional videos, including body camera footage from the officers' interviews with workers at the Circle K who refuted the man’s assault claim, as well as other files of McAlpin’s arrest. The attorney said he plans to file a lawsuit if he does not receive the information by November.\n\nEarlier this year, the Justice Department found the Phoenix Police Department discriminates against Black, Hispanic and Native American people when enforcing the law, uses excessive force, disproportionately targets communities of color, and unlawfully detains homeless people.

Samantha is a Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University and author of a book I love and recommend to pretty much everyone, “Everyday Vitality: Turning Stress into Strength.” It is about how ruminating isn’t helpful, and that the only thing that really changes your life is taking action! Whether it’s a walk, meeting up with a friend, or finally trying something you’ve been anxious about — action switches things up. And yet our culture seems to relish coming up with new things to worry about and avoid!\n\nWhich brings me to Samantha’s delightful, insightful Substack, The Dose, and its timely piece:\n\nby Samantha Boardman\n\nEvery August, the same ritual begins. Parents frantically Google “back-to-school anxiety tips.” Schools send home preparation checklists. Mental health experts publish articles about the “inevitable” stress of returning to the classroom. We’re told children are “bound to experience” anxiety, that the transition will be “jarring,” and that we must watch for behavioral warning signs indicating distress.\n\nBut what if all this well-intentioned preparation is backfiring? What if, by treating back-to-school as an inherently stressful experience requiring extensive emotional support, we’re actually teaching our children to expect, and therefore experience, exactly that stress?\n\nThe Expectation Effect in Action\n\nResearch on the expectation effect reveals a powerful truth: our predictions about experiences often become self-fulfilling prophecies. When we expect pain during a medical procedure, we feel more pain. When we expect a social interaction to be awkward, it becomes awkward. And when we spend weeks preparing children for the “stress” and “anxiety” of returning to school, we’re essentially training their brains to anticipate and create those very experiences.\n\nConsider the language saturating back-to-school messaging. Experts warn about the social and emotional “summer slide“—as if children regress during vacation. Middle school transitions are described as inevitably difficult, with parents advised to prepare for the shock of “multiple teachers for different subjects.” We’re told to monitor for “uncharacteristic sleep disturbances” and “increased defiance” as signs of back-to-school anxiety.\n\nThe irony is striking: in our effort to protect children from stress, we’re potentially manufacturing it.\n\nWhen Normal Becomes Pathological\n\nThere’s nothing inherently traumatic about getting a new teacher, walking between classrooms, or adjusting sleep schedules. Humans are remarkably adaptable creatures, especially children. For millions of kids throughout history, September simply meant returning to learning, no extensive emotional preparation required.\n\nYet today’s messaging suggests that without careful intervention, children will inevitably struggle. One recent article opens with a detailed case study of a nine-year-old “feeling anxious as the school year approaches,” immediately priming readers to expect similar struggles in their own children. Parents are warned to watch for a laundry list of concerning behaviors: “headaches, nausea, fatigue” or children who “seek continual reassurance about what their school days will look like.”\n\nWe’re pathologizing normal developmental experiences, turning routine adjustments into cause for concern. A child who seems quiet after the first day isn’t just processing new experiences, they’re showing “warning signs.” A kid who takes time to warm up to their teacher isn’t displaying normal social caution, they need “support strategies.”\n\nThe Confidence Gap\n\nWhen we constantly prepare children for difficulties they haven’t yet encountered, we inadvertently communicate a lack of confidence in their abilities. The subtext of endless preparation is clear: “This is going to be hard for you. You probably can’t handle it without help.”\n\nChildren are intuitive. They pick up on our anxiety, our excessive planning, our worried expressions during “practice runs” to school buildings. They internalize the message that going back to school is something to fear rather than anticipate or even look forward to.\n\nResearch on academic mindset shows that children perform better when adults express confidence in their capabilities rather than constantly preparing them for failure. Yet our current approach does the opposite, it primes children to expect struggle and positions us as the experts on their emotional states rather than trusting them to navigate new experiences.\n\nThe Rumination Trap\n\nWhen we encourage children to identify their negative feelings about school, monitor their anxiety levels, and prepare for social difficulties, we’re inadvertently teaching them to ruminate by repeatedly focusing on potential negative outcomes. Put simply, excessive focus on potential problems increases their likelihood.\n\nStudies show that rumination is a key factor in developing anxiety and depression. By encouraging children to constantly examine their emotional states and prepare for difficulties, we’re training them in a thinking pattern that’s linked to poor mental health outcomes. One expert actually advises parents to watch for subtle behavioral shifts like a child having “a more difficult time falling asleep” or finding previously enjoyable activities “particularly challenging,” essentially teaching hypervigilance about normal fluctuations in mood and behavior.\n\nWhat Actually Helps\n\nA more effective approach is to trust children’s natural resilience and address problems if and when they actually arise, rather than creating elaborate systems to monitor and manage difficulties that may never materialize.\n\nThis isn’t an argument for negligent parenting or ignoring genuine difficulties. Some children do face real challenges with school transitions, and they deserve support. But for most kids, the best back-to-school preparation is surprisingly simple:\n\nExpress Confidence\n\nInstead of asking, “Are you worried about school?” try “What are you looking forward to this year?” Rather than preparing for problems, communicate your belief in their capabilities.\n\nKeep It Routine\n\nTreat back-to-school like any other seasonal transition. Adjust bedtimes gradually, buy supplies, meet the teacher. No drama required.\n\nModel Calm\n\nChildren regulate their emotions based on the adults around them. If you’re anxious about their return to school, they will be too. If you’re matter-of-fact and positive, they’re likely to follow suit.\n\nTrust the Process\n\nMost children adapt to new situations within days or weeks, regardless of preparation. Human beings are wired for adaptation—it’s what we do best.\n\nRewriting the Narrative\n\nImagine if we approached back-to-school with the same energy we bring to other positive life transitions. Instead of articles about managing anxiety, what if we celebrated children’s growth and new opportunities? Rather than preparing for problems, what if we focused on possibilities?\n\nThe shift isn’t just semantic; it’s psychological. When we expect positive outcomes, we’re more likely to achieve them. When we approach challenges with curiosity rather than dread, we build resilience rather than fragility.\n\nOur children are watching. They’re learning not just academic subjects, but also how to approach life’s transitions. Are we teaching them that new experiences are threats to be carefully managed, or adventures to be embraced?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGoing back to school isn’t a mental health crisis. It’s September. Children have been doing it successfully for generations without extensive emotional preparation. Research on resilience shows that children are far more adaptable than our current anxiety-focused messaging suggests.\n\nBy treating normal transitions as inherently problematic, we risk creating the very difficulties we’re trying to prevent. The most powerful gift we can give our children isn’t another coping strategy or anxiety management technique; it’s our confidence in their ability to handle whatever comes their way.\n\n\\", "source_domain": "www.freerangekids.com"}

Bennie Thompson: Life will get significantly harder for lower income Mississippians due to federal budget cuts", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Mississippi, long known as the poorest state in the United States, will soon face even greater shortfalls as a result of drastic cuts included in the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” in proposed congressional and Trump administration budgets, and in related executive orders.\n\n“There isn’t a hospital in a bunch of the counties I represent, and many could close in the near future,” U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told The Mississippi Independent in assessing the impact of the cuts on healthcare in his district. “In one county, there isn’t even a doctor. That’s only going to get worse.”\n\nStrapped rural hospitals could be forced to close as a result of massive cuts to Medicaid, Thompson said.\n\nIn addition, Thompson said, 100 percent of children in some parts of his district get daytime meals free as a result of federal safety net programs — a nutritional allotment that they will now likely lose.\n\nGenerations of disinvestment, a history of racial conflict and chronic underfunding of public schools have entrenched economic hardship from the farm communities of the Delta to languishing mill towns in the hills. The state’s median household income, $54,204 in 2023, ranked last in the nation, and nearly one in five residents lives below the federal poverty line. More than a quarter of the state’s children live in poverty.\n\nNow comes a new wave of economic headwinds that threatens to push the state even further behind: Persistent and likely worsening inflation, rising tariffs on imported goods, and sweeping federal cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other safety-net programs.\n\nAround 370,000 Mississippians rely on food assistance and more than 667,000 depend on Medicaid, both of which are slated for significant reductions under the Trump administration’s 2026 fiscal budget and related executive actions.\n\nSonya Williams-Barnes, a former Mississippi state lawmaker and the state’s Southern Poverty Law Center policy director, told The Mississippi Independent the cuts will be keenly felt once they take effect.\n\n“Programs like Medicaid and SNAP and even housing assistance, they aren’t luxuries,” Williams-Barnes said. “They are lifelines for a lot of people. If and when these programs are cut, we’ll see it immediately. Parents will skip meals so their kids can eat. Rural hospitals are already closing, and some people are literally dying on the way to the hospital. Even a $100 rent increase can become impossible for families. This isn’t about budget lines, this is about survival.”\n\nIn April, U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith assured Mississippians that Medicaid would remain untouched. “Nothing is going to happen to Medicaid. Why is everyone’s head exploding?” she asked. Yet under the bill that Hyde-Smith’s voted for two months later, the program serving 78.3 million Americans is slated to lose $1.1 trillion in funding during the next decade.\n\nMore than half of Mississippi’s Medicaid recipients are children and nearly 60 percent live in rural areas, according to a May 2025 report by KFF, a San Francisco-based health policy research organization.\n\nIn addition to Medicaid, reductions are included for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, rental assistance, Affordable Care Act subsidies, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nWhile the Big Beautiful Bill Act was promoted as a measure to rein in the national debt, it pairs draconian reductions with sweeping tax cuts for the wealthy, a combination that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will actually add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit during the next decade.\n\nFood assistance on the chopping block\n\nSNAP benefits reach about one in eight Mississippians, with more than 60 percent going to families with children. Reductions could mean skipped meals, poorer nutrition and higher rates of childhood malnutrition, with long-term effects on educational attainment and workforce readiness, according to the Children’s Defense Fund’s policy director, Lauren Reliford.\n\n“Policymakers already have the data,” Reliford said. “They know that losing access to these services means exposing children to an increased risk of negative impacts to their brain. They have also heard the stories from their constituents, children, parents and advocates that hunger and chronic illness create constant stressors that deprive them of their dignity, hope and joy. These safety net programs are often the only means they have to meet their most basic needs. They help put food on the table, ensure that ear infections and bad falls are healed properly, and keep children healthy and focused on doing what matters most — thriving so they can grow into the adults they are meant to be.”\n\nEconomically, the SNAP program is a local multiplier: Every federal dollar spent on it generates up to $1.80 in economic activity, often propping up small-town grocery stores. Removing that flow of money could hurt local businesses and overwhelm already stretched food banks, according to an NPR report.\n\nDoes cutting welfare save money?\n\nThe political debate around welfare comes down to two competing philosophies. Fiscal conservatives contend that cutting back safety nets will help trim the government’s $37 trillion debt and force people into self-sufficiency, an argument used to justify controversial welfare reforms of the 1990s, which conservative lawmakers claimed were meant to reinforce core American values of individual responsibility, hard work, independence and free enterprise.\n\nThe other side of the argument is that welfare and other safety nets help pull people out of poverty, reducing the depth of economic hardship and promoting public health. They also argue that claims of debt reduction are disingenuous because the budget bill’s tax cuts for the wealthy and other massive expenditures will significantly increase the deficit.\n\nThe core element of the 1996 reforms, known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, was work requirements, similar to what is contained in the 2026 budget. Whether those 30-year-old reforms worked depends on which studies you read. If the measure of success is how many people the reforms got off welfare, they were a success. From a welfare participation high of 14.2 million in 1993, the number dropped to 5.3 million in March 2002, according to the Center for the Study of Federalism. With the help of a strong economy in the 1990s, poverty was reduced to 11.3 percent by 2000.\n\nOne 2010 study noted that while 50 percent to 60 percent of former welfare recipients found jobs, the average wage was between $5.50 and $7 per hour. Low wages meant that working full-time in low-paying jobs temporarily relieved poverty, but did not provide a permanent solution to generational poverty, the study noted. By 2010, the poverty rate had climbed back to 15.1 percent, the same as it was in 1993, which in real numbers is an additional seven million Americans in poverty.\n\n“That whole work rhetoric is absolute nonsense,” Rep. Thompson said. “Mississippi has been here before. If there are no jobs in a community, you can’t just wish them there. For every dollar Mississippi sends to Washington, we get about $2.80 back. We are a dependent state and if that’s going to change, people need real opportunities to escape poverty, not low-paying jobs.”\n\n\n\nThe SPLC’s Williams-Barnes echoed the congressman’s comments. “Right now, programs in Mississippi are structured to keep you poor,” she said. “You can only make so much money before you’re cut off. You never get an opportunity to really get ahead. We need to layer education, workforce development and direct cash assistance to help people get back on their feet, and without barriers.”\n\nConservative analysts continue to argue that work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP are the best way to get people off welfare and bolster the economy. “Medicaid costs have exploded, and taxpayers are now on the hook for more than $900 billion per year,” noted a June 2025 research paper by the Foundation for Government Accountability, a Florida-based conservative public policy think tank. “The primary driver of the growth in spending has been enrollment, as able-bodied adults have swelled the program. With no work requirements in place, the program encourages dependency and siphons resources away from the truly needy.”\n\nSNAP research conducted by the Florida think tank in May 2025 reached a similar conclusion, noting that “most able-bodied adults on the program are exempt from work requirements and bureaucratic loopholes have allowed states to skirt them even further, waiving them for as many able-adults as possible.”\n\nYet supporters point out that the programs are lifelines, particularly in poor states like Mississippi, and that jobs are often unavailable, and that health insurance will be beyond their reach under the 2026 budget. According to state data, about one in four Mississippi residents are on Medicaid, and overall, the state’s healthcare system is ranked last in the nation. Even better situated Mississippians are losing access to healthcare subsidies and to nearby healthcare facilities that are dependent on Medicare for their financial survival.\n\nNearly half of the state’s rural hospitals are at risk of closure, and Medicaid cuts could trigger hundreds of thousands to lose health insurance coverage and push more facilities into insolvency. According to the American Hospital Association, every $1 million reduction in Medicaid spending translates to roughly 15 lost healthcare jobs -- positions that will not be easily replaced in rural towns already facing physician shortages.\n\nWhat else is at risk?\n\nThe budget cuts would reach far beyond headline programs, slicing into less-visible federal supports that quietly sustain Mississippi’s fragile economy. While aid is being reduced, many residents will also face higher taxes and the inroads of inflation, which is expected to worsen due to tariffs. Inflation, which peaked nationally at 9.1 percent in 2022, continues to erode wages. Tariffs on imported goods are compounding the pressure, raising the cost of everyday staples. The bill’s tax provisions were pitched as a path to long-term growth and deficit reduction, but according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, households earning under $40,000 will see higher federal tax bills over the next decade.\n\nMississippi is sometimes labeled one of the nation’s most affordable states, but low wages dilute any cost-of-living advantage, and in rural food deserts, where grocery stores may be many miles away and more expensive, each paycheck is stretched even more.\n\nThat reality is stark in places like Jefferson County, which is often named the most food-insecure county in the U.S. County residents there face both some of the lowest incomes and steep barriers to affordable, healthy food. Across Mississippi, 63 of 82 counties are classified as food deserts, according to a study in the Engaged Scholarship for Resilient Communities journal.\n\n“Tariffs under any circumstances for populations that are already vulnerable, it just takes them underwater,” Thompson noted. “For that population, a tariff is, for lack of a better term, an attack — an increased cost for which they don’t have the disposable income other families have. Between taxes and increased costs because of tariffs, people are being hit twice, and it will make life in Mississippi much harder.”\n\nThough nonprofits work to fill the gaps, many have relied on government support that is now drying up. Since Trump began his second term, billions of dollars in support funds have been cut. “Nonprofits will begin to cry out to the state, because they work directly with impacted persons,” Williams-Barnes said. “Even food banks, after-school programs and daycare programs are all being cut. Women are unable to go to work because daycare assistance has been eliminated. Without that help, they simply can’t make it.”\n\nWilliams-Barnes warned that cuts to nonprofit grants will add to the hardship. “Without them, our state’s most vulnerable residents are just going to face deeper poverty and fewer opportunities to escape it.”\n\nAdding another economic burden is the proposed dismantling of the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which reaches millions of U.S. households annually, helps more than 45,000 Mississippians with bill payments during triple-digit summer heat and occasional winter freezes. Trump has proposed to cut the entire program.\n\nAll state residents face potential challenges as a result of cuts to climate resilience funding, though natural disasters are particularly burdensome for the poor. Mississippi, with its frequent floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, is a national leader in FEMA disaster declarations per capita. Federal dollars also pay for levee repairs, coastal restoration and water projects essential to places like the Delta, the Gulf Coast and Jackson, where water systems have repeatedly failed. Reductions could accelerate infrastructure collapse and deepen public health crises.\n\nWhile these cuts strike broadly, their greatest impacts will be on children, the population with the least ability to absorb the shock. For many Mississippi families, programs such as Medicaid and SNAP are not just stopgaps — they are the foundation that enables children to stay healthy, fed and in school.\n\n“Decades of research has shown that healthy children become healthy adults who then create healthy communities -- economies that persist for generations after,” Reliford said. “We must stop asking, ‘Can these cuts build a stronger economy?’ and start asking, ‘Why are you making these cuts in the face of overwhelming evidence that they hurt us all?’”\n\nImage: Inspirational messages on the wall of a building in Clarksdale, Mississippi (Alan Huffman)", "source_domain": "msindy.org"}

My life with sickle cell disease is a relentless cycle of excruciating pain, nerve damage and blood transfusions. I’ve survived two kidney transplants, countless medical procedures and numerous near-death experiences.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nDecades of hospital stays and medical trauma have left me living with depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder. The physical strain is constant, and the emotional toll — knowing that a single crisis can upend my life — is heavy.\n\nIt is true but of little comfort to know that I am not alone. Millions of Americans like me have debilitating medical conditions. Even when we are doing everything “right” — working, getting a college education, trying to build a stable future — we cannot keep pace with the demands of a system that expects disabled people to work like we aren’t sick and survive like we don’t need care. Every time I pushed myself past my limits to meet that expectation, I ended up in the hospital, paying with my body.\n\nAnd so, like many others, I have relied on Medicaid, the government’s program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. It is not a gravy train.\n\nIn New Jersey, where I live, the income cap for people receiving SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) and enrolled in Medicaid is about $1,550 a month. Income restrictions vary by state — I once spoke to someone in Arizona whose cap was just $500. These outdated limits force the disabled community into poverty by design. If we earn too much, we risk losing the medical care that keeps us alive. The safety net isn’t really a net — it’s a ceiling.\n\nI am very grateful for the safety net we have. Many countries offer nothing to people like me. As a legal immigrant from Nigeria who came to the United States as a five-month-old baby, I would not be alive today without the help I have received from these programs. By protecting and strengthening this system, we honor the lives of those who depend on it.\n\nBut now, all of this is at risk. The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” will cut Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade and includes new work requirements that will push millions off coverage. According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, these changes could affect 10 to 12 million Americans, many of whom are already medically vulnerable.\n\nAnd this means, quite frankly, that people like me will die.\n\n“There’s really no questioning the basic reality that you can’t take health care away from 10 million people without causing many preventable deaths,” Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and health policy researcher at Harvard Medical School, recently told the Associated Press. The projected impact is 7.6 million people stripped of coverage and more than 16,600 preventable deaths annually.\n\nEvery time benefits are threatened or politicized, disabled people relive the fear that our care can be taken away. The system teaches us not to dream too big, not to earn too much, not to imagine a life beyond survival. How can people living with chronic illnesses or disabilities plan for stability — let alone home ownership or retirement — when every dollar earned is a risk to our lives?\n\nPolicymakers must confront this systemic failure. We need income caps raised or eliminated, work requirements rejected and Medicaid protections strengthened. Survival alone is not enough; we deserve the chance to thrive without fear that a job, a dream or a single extra paycheck will cost us our lives.\n\nCutting Medicaid and penalizing disabled workers is not fiscal responsibility — it’s moral failure. Our lives should not be budget line items. For me, and for millions like me, the stakes could not be clearer: Policy choices will determine whether or not we get to live.", "source_domain": "www.westhawaiitoday.com"}

He recently shared several mental health tips with U.S. News & World Report.\n\n“Mindfulness can help to divert attention away from any anxieties. The mind has trouble experiencing two emotions or situations at the exact same time.”\n\n“Taking a moment to feel the breeze, fully enjoy and appreciate the food that you're eating and actively focus on the conversation that you're having with a loved one can significantly reduce unhappy feelings and lead to better mental health.”\n\nDespite the popularity of the 3-3-3 rule, a grounding technique in which one focuses on three things they can see, hear and body parts they can physically move, he prefers a simpler exercise of setting a timer for 60 seconds and tuning in.\n\n\"During those 60 seconds, feel your breath, hear your breath and experience your breath. What does it feel like as you're breathing in? What does it feel like when you're breathing out? What is that experience like for you? When the alarm goes off, that's the end of the exercise.”\n\nMcCarron is a psychiatrist with UCI Health Psychiatry Services who has been named a Physician of Excellence by the Orange County Medical Association.
