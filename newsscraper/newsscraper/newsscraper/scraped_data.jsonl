(KKTV) - Two Colorado Springs residents have been charged after a 15-year-old girl died from a fentanyl intoxication, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nOn June 7, officials said court documents outlined that Colorado Springs Police and emergency medical services responded to a report of a responsive female. Upon arrival, they say the 15-year-old girl was found dead.\n\nUpon arrival, officials said investigators found nine blue pills with “M” and “30″ on them wrapped in a receipt that was linked to 57-year-old Eugene Edwards.\n\nOfficials said a search of the victim’s phone revealed that she had planned to meet with Edwards to buy the pills at a Colorado Springs elementary school the night before she died.\n\nSurveillance footage and a license plate reader confirmed that Edwards’ car was near the same elementary school, and officials said an hour later, video showed the victim outside of her home smoking what appeared to be the fentanyl. They say she died shortly after.\n\nEdwards, who had several felony convictions for robbery, burglary and drug offences, was arrested on June 13 after suspected fentanyl and meth were found in his vehicle, officials said. They shared that 10 pills found in his vehicle were wrapped in a receipt.\n\nDuring an interview, officials said Edwards admitted that he got the pills from a woman identified as 30-year-old Destiny Benjamin.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, cell phone records and texts between Edwards and Benjamin detailed that their relationship was based on supplying drugs for money, including meth and fentanyl. Edwards reportedly shared that his only current supply of fentanyl pills came from Benjamin.\n\nOfficials say Benjamin was also arrested on June 13, and fentanyl, meth and a loaded handgun were found at the time of her arrest. They said Benjamin admitted to investigators that she had provided drugs to Edwards.\n\nAccording to officials, conspiracy to distribute fentanyl resulting in death carries a possible penalty of 20 years to life in prison, a fine of no more than $1 million and no less than three years of supervised release.\n\nCopyright 2025 KKTV.

But important issues remain: lawmakers still need to deal with the depleted mental health workforce and to address gun violence without fueling stigma.\n\nGreg Hansch is executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of Texas. Colleen Horton is director of policy at the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nHansch says the Legislature accomplished a lot this past session, especially in terms of state hospitals and school mental health:\n\n“A couple examples in this most recent legislative session of big successes were: funding for the state hospital system to modernize and reconstruct some of the facilities that are available there to improve quality and access … and we saw probably some of the most significant children’s mental health reforms that we’ve ever seen in this state, really leveraging schools as an opportunity to intervene early.”\n\nHorton says the Legislature failed to address the state’s mental health workforce:\n\n“We have an extreme workforce shortage in Texas when it comes to mental health care. And we have to look more at why our percentage of doctors who participate in the Medicaid program is so low.”\n\nHorton also says there’s underlying causes to mental health conditions that are often overlooked:\n\n“It’s often about the societal illnesses that create communities that aren’t mentally well, or mentally healthy. … We also have to think about, especially when we talk about violence, is the societal illnesses such as racism, bigotry, social isolation, despair, anger – those things aren’t mental illnesses. But research has shown that they are the cause of much of the violence that we have in our country.”\n\nImproving mental health is a bipartisan issue in Texas, but Hansch says it often gets lost among other policy priorities:\n\n“In the last legislative session, funding for the public education system and addressing property taxes were the signature issues.”\n\nHansch expects mental health and the criminal justice system to be a key topic for lawmakers during the 2021 session:\n\n“One of the big points of conversation in [the] next legislative session is going to be how well are judges, county officials, sheriffs and other local decision-makers … working together and with the state to change the fact that the criminal justice system is the default provider, or the default setting, where people with mental health conditions end up.”\n\nHansch says recent mass shootings have been catalysts for improving the mental health care system:\n\n“I think there are better reasons to address mental health in our state than trying to address mass shootings, but my sense is that the train has left the station. The Legislature is going to look at the root causes of mass shootings and keep identifying mental health as one of those factors.”\n\nBut Hansch says it’s unclear what legislation could come out of these moments of crisis:\n\n“I do think we’re going to have a robust conversation about access to firearms. In some cases, we can see how a person with a mental health condition who has access to a firearm can be a dangerous situation … to [themselves], but we also need to think about danger to others.”\n\nHorton says blaming mass shootings exclusively on mental illness fuels stigma:\n\n“[It] can really do a lot of damage and create a lot of stigma that will prevent people from seeking out mental health services. If we talk about creating registries … then how many people will be willing to go to a mental health professional and get assessed?”\n\nHansch says NAMI supported proposals for so-called red flag gun laws that don’t single out those with mental health conditions:\n\n“Our support for those proposals only exists because those proposals don’t specifically target people with mental health conditions. The way that a red flag law should be designed is that it targets people who are exhibiting dangerous behavior, and the judge has discretion about what constitutes [that].”\n\nRates of mental illness are similar in other countries, but not rates of gun violence, Horton says:\n\n“Other countries have the same rate of mental illness and mental health conditions as we do in our country and they don’t have the same rates of gun violence and mass shootings.”\n\nIt’s essential that those living with mental health conditions participate in policymaking, Horton says:\n\n“Having the person with lived experience of mental health conditions and substance use conditions at the table, in the hearing rooms, at the agency … far too often advocates and family members and policymakers think we know how to do it, think we know what people need, and we often don’t.”", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org"}

On Saturday, September 7, 2019 more than 65 HCA Healthcare facilities will partner with local law enforcement agencies to collect unused and expired prescription medications in 15 states.\n\nWith over 38,000 employed and affiliated physicians at its 184 hospitals and approximately 2,000 sites of care, HCA Healthcare is helping to combat the opioid epidemic by ensuring patients have access to safer, more effective chronic pain treatment, raising awareness about the dangers of opioid addiction and providing proper disposal of these medications.\n\n“We are working to create healthier communities by partnering with our colleagues, patients and neighbors and engaging on important healthcare issues such as this one,” said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of The HCA Healthcare Foundation.\n\n“The abuse of prescription drugs too often starts when family or friends obtain medications from home medicine cabinets,” adds Pulles. “We urge people to take three simple steps: clean out your medicine cabinet, collect medications that are no longer needed and safely dispose of them at one of our ‘Crush the Crisis’ take back locations.”\n\nIn addition to “Crush the Crisis” events on September 7, more than 20 HCA Healthcare hospitals will host events later this year. In total, approximately 90 HCA Healthcare hospitals will participate. For a complete list of “Crush the Crisis” collection sites, click here.\n\nBreaking down the opioid crisis: Every day, more than Every day, more than 130 people in the United States die of opioid overdose. In 2017 alone, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. The numbers are astronomical, enough for the President to declare opioids a public health emergency . The brunt of the epidemic is not just felt by those who succumb to opiates, but also by family, friends and the communities that HCA Healthcare serves.\n\nThe importance of take back events\n\nFacilities across the HCA Healthcare network lie in states heavily impacted by the opioid crisis. Caregivers know the scourge of opioid misuse, addiction and overdose. “Every day, hospitals across the country treat patients for opioid overdose in emergency rooms,” said Dr. Michael Schlosser, vice president of clinical excellence and surgical services at HCA Healthcare.\n\n“Take back events are vital to helping prevent drug overdose, controlling illicit drug use and curbing our nation’s opioid crisis,” says Schlosser.\n\nMore than half of people who misuse opioid medications report:\n\nObtaining them for free or stealing them from someone they know\n\nGoing to multiple doctors to get additional prescriptions\n\nFilling prescriptions at different pharmacies so that no one will notice how many pills they get each month\n\nTeens hold a common misperception that prescription drugs are less harmful than other drugs; in the past year, two-thirds of teens who misused pain relievers reported that they got them from family, friends and the home medicine cabinet.\n\nEven our littlest patients are affected. Every minute of every day, a poison control center answers a call about a young child who has accidentally ingested a medication.\n\nThe safest and most responsible option to dispose of medication is to take unwanted medications to a drug take back site or event. Unused opioids thrown in the trash can be retrieved and abused or sold illegally. Flushing medications down the toilet pose a potentially health and environmental hazard.\n\nWhat HCA Healthcare is doing\n\n“Crush the Crisis” opioid take back events are just one spot, among many, in HCA Healthcare’s dedication to curbing opioid misuse.\n\nWatch:\n\nHarnessing scale and resources\n\nIn 2018, HCA Healthcare’s TriStar Health Division, headquartered in Nashville, hosted the first “Crush the Crisis” event. More than 224 pounds of medication, equivalent to over 100,000 doses, were anonymously collected across eight hospitals.\n\n“We were excited about the success of our TriStar Health Division’s take back day last year and knew that with HCA Healthcare’s scale, we could make an even greater impact by expanding this program to more of the communities we serve,” said Dr. Schlosser.\n\nIn addition to “Crush the Crisis” take back events, approximately 11 HCA Healthcare affiliated hospitals nationwide will launch permanent medication collection boxes.\n\nPartnership is key\n\nHCA Healthcare proudly partners with the National Academy of Medicine (NAM)’s Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic, consisting of more than 50 organizations that share best practices and identify gaps in the safe treatment of opioid addiction.\n\nHCA Healthcare has committed $500,000 to the Collaborative to support development of safer pain management protocols and reversal of the opioid crisis.\n\nNAM president, Dr. Victor Dzau, Assistant HHS Secretary Dr. Brett Giroir, Dr. Ruth Katz and HCA Healthcare’s president of clinical services and chief medical officer, Dr. Jonathan Perlin, serve as co-chairs for the Collaborative to combat over-prescription of opioids, improve provider education, and address under-treatment of opioid use disorders.\n\nDr. Mike Schlosser serves on the NAM “Opioid Prescribing Guidelines and Evidence Standards” committee, which is synthesizing evidence-based practices, establishing a clearinghouse for best practices and identifying gaps in research for safe treatment of opioid addiction.\n\nNew strategies for pain management\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR)\n\nHCA Healthcare developed new strategies to manage pain for the 1.5 million patients that have surgery annually in an HCA Healthcare facility. HCA Healthcare’s Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR) is an innovative surgical approach that uses evidence-based pre, intra, and post-operative interventions to optimize patient outcomes.\n\nESR, which features a multi-modal approach to pain management for patients, has demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and – importantly – a drastic reduction in the use for opioids.\n\nMulti-modal pain management, focuses on using two or more different methods or medications to manage pain and reduces the need to use opioids to manage a patient’s pain while recovering from surgery. This approach results in significantly decreased opioid use and opioid prescriptions.\n\nHCA Healthcare data from January 2018 through June 2019, collected from 47,400 major abdominal, joint, gynecologic oncology, spinal and bariatric ESR surgeries revealed an up to 50.4% decrease in opioid use for these patients.\n\nThe data, collected from 114 affiliate hospitals, was compared to a non-ESR protocol patient population undergoing the same surgery procedures in the same time period.\n\nAs of June 2019, ESR is live at 127 HCA Healthcare facilities, with the goal to implement in all facilities for at least one major service line by the end of 2019.\n\nALTernatives to Opioids in the Emergency Room (ALTO in the ER)\n\nWith ALTO in the ER, HCA Healthcare’s goal is to manage painful conditions for emergency department patients and return them to a maximum quality of life, while recognizing and reducing the inherent risks of administering and prescribing highly addictive medications like opioids.\n\nIn 2017, affiliate Swedish Medical Center pioneered the first-of-its-kind strategy to curtail potential opioid misuse related to the use of opioids in the emergency department.\n\nWith the ALTO in the ER program, rather than using opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone or fentanyl, medications like ketamine and lidocaine are employed for frontline pain management.\n\nBecause of this emergency department initiative, patient opioid use at affiliate Swedish Medical Center from June – November of 2017 was reduced by 36%, compared to data from a non-ALTO patient population over the same time period in 2016.\n\nHCA Healthcare plans to expand the ALTO in the ER protocols enterprise-wide in 2019.\n\nElectronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS)\n\nElectronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS) aims to stem increasing rates of opioid-related addiction, misuse diversion and death by making it more difficult for medication-seekers to doctor-shop and alter prescriptions. Physicians have access to aggregated electronic health record (EHR) data that will help them to prescribe opioids judiciously.\n\nECPS allows clinicians to see patients’ medication histories at the point of care, which helps identify patients who may be exhibiting behaviors associated with drug misuse. ECPS also ensures that prescriptions are securely transmitted from clinician to pharmacy without risk for forgery or alteration. As of June 2019, more than 2,800 physicians across HCA Healthcare have EPCS.\n\nJoin the action by finding a “Crush the Crisis” collection take back site near you by visiting HCAhealthcare.com/CrushTheCrisis.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

Several states are collectively putting billions into safety-net hospitals with ties to both the civil and justice systems. At the same time, the private sector struggles to convert demand for services into business opportunities.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy-era deinstitutionalization, public and private investment in psychiatric hospitals, which care for those with the most dire and acute behavioral health issues, has fallen well short of patient demand and need. Similarly, investment in community-based behavioral health and social services has not reached a level to either allow for care in lower-acuity settings or prevent them altogether.\n\n“The pendulum might have swung from a point where we had too many beds and too many people institutionalized in the 1960s to another extreme where the community investment has not been there to keep people out of a fewer number beds,” Nelson Jarrin, senior vice president of state policy at the Texas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, told BHB.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeadows Mental Health Policy Institute is a nonpartisan mental health policy think tank.\n\nThe situation leaves state administrations and legislatures looking for ways to intervene. Most of those actions exclude private-sector partners. Rather, these initiatives compensate for the private sector’s failure to meet the overwhelming demand while making up for decades of underinvestment.\n\nOver the past seven years, Texas’ state legislature has appropriated just over $3.6 billion into state psychiatric hospitals and other community-based psychiatric bed initiatives. This is part of a larger effort to bolster the behavioral health economy in Texas. Earlier in the year, the Texas legislature allocated $11 billion to several behavioral health-related projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second-largest state in the U.S., its roughly 30 million resident population is about the same size as the 19 least populous states in the country, according to 2022 census data.\n\nPublic-private partnerships are included in these funding efforts but are few; most of the funding is dedicated to alleviating a severe shortage of psychiatric beds meant to rehabilitate those with connections to the justice system. These so-called forensic beds are often the exclusive purview of state hospitals and have experienced a dramatic transformation in who they treat.\n\nAbout 30 years ago, roughly 70% of the patients in Texas state psychiatric hospitals were there for civil reasons, with the remainder committed for care while they were awaiting trial or were deemed incompetent to stand trial, Jarrin said. Today, the ratio has reversed, with forensic patients making up the vast majority of state hospital’s rosters.\n\n“When you talk about private companies and private psychiatric beds, they generally want to stay in the civil space,” Jarrin said. “They don’t want to take anybody who has criminal charges or is found incompetent to stand trial, even though the treatment component is essentially the same for forensic patients.”\n\nThe shortage of forensic psychiatric beds has led to a 2,200-person waitlist within the justice system.\n\nIn instances where private organizations have partnered with state and local governments in Texas, private entities have had to take on beds for low-level forensic patients to alleviate the waitlist.\n\nSome examples of partnerships with private organizations include Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas getting $64 million to add 72 beds to an existing campus and $102 million to complete the Texas Behavioral Health Center in Dallas.\n\nThe latter project includes the involvement of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, which is affiliated with the state university system, as well as the UT Southwestern Medical School. State universities and medical schools offer compelling partners for reinvigorating state hospital systems. Oklahoma officials recently announced initiatives with some similarities to those in Texas.\n\nKeeping state hospital investment in government family\n\nPublic universities and their affiliated medical schools and health systems already have the infrastructure and the know-how to partner with state officials on big-dollar, potentially systemically relevant investments.\n\nThe Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) announced on Sept. 11 that it will partner with Oklahoma State University (OSU) to build a 330-bed psychiatric hospital at the OSU-Oklahoma City campus.\n\nThe facility will cost $147 million and provide 275 adult beds and 55 pediatric beds. Named Donahue Behavioral Health, the facility will replace Griffin Memorial Hospital, based in Norman, Oklahoma, and add 100 net new beds to the state hospital system. Doors are expected to open in 2026.\n\n“Like many states, our state psychiatric hospitals are very old and take a lot of dollars in upkeep,” ODMHSAS Commissioner Carrie Slatton-Hodges told BHB. “We’ve been wanting to have services and facilities for persons with mental illness that rival the best care that can be received from physical care.”\n\nThe funds for the project come from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021, a Biden administration stimulus funding and policy project meant to propel the country out of the COVID-era economic slump and reform several aspects of American infrastructure. It pumped billions into state and county government coffers. An ARPA-focused legislative committee championed the project.\n\nDonahue Behavioral Health will not be a forensic hospital, Slatton-Hodges said. However, police will be able to get people experiencing a mental health crisis to this or other behavioral health urgent care centers run by the states.\n\n“We have found over and over that people inadvertently go the criminal route if they don’t have resources readily available,” Slatton-Hodges said. “[Police officers] are much more likely to not move that person down a criminal path if those resources are readily available.”\n\nSlatton-Hodges notes that the demands of patients and the ability of medical professionals to treat behavioral health facilities fundamentally changed what state psychiatric hospitals will look like now and in the future. In short, Slatton-Hodges says the era of warehousing those with disabilities is long over.\n\nThe new facility will include a significant urgent care and outpatient care offering meant to keep people at the right level of care rather than defaulting to warehousing people for all behavioral health issues.\n\nWhile the deinstitutionalization movement may have overshot shrinking psychiatric beds, the need for beds has changed as well; states won’t need to offer as many thousands of beds for patients as they did decades ago.\n\n“The right number of beds changed,” Slatton-Hodges said. “While we no longer need institutions or places for people to live separate from the community, we still need a place for people when they are experiencing acute symptoms, to be able to have those stabilized so that they can continue with their life within the community.”\n\nSlatton-Hodges said that private investment into psychiatric facilities was lacking for adults but tended to appear more robustly for pediatric patients. She noted that while private investment supported broader spectrums of behavioral health, it often could not meet the present need.\n\n“If you operate in the private setting, you’re not going to build something based on a high uninsured rate that will need that service,” Slatton-Hodges said. “It’s a long road for the private health systems to feel like psychiatric care for an adult population is a business that is viable… I don’t know that behavioral health will ever be as lucrative as, say, opening a cancer wing or opening a heart wing.”\n\nStepping into the private market void\n\nThe private sector of psychiatric care is somewhat enigmatic.\n\nThese facilities face immense systemic pressures, leading to several for-profit and nonprofit health care organizations shuttering whole facilities or divisions altogether. At the same time, several businesses are trying to crack the code to meet the immense need for psychiatric care in a way that makes financial sense, often through partnerships and joint ventures.\n\nStill, while the private sector struggles with the business case of psychiatric hospitals, state governments often see themselves as the last line of defense for providing care. The issue is even worse for patients whose mental health issues may have led to violent tendencies or run-ins with law enforcement.\n\n“There is very little bed capacity within the private sector; where else are forensic patients going to go?” Tyler Hemstreet, a Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) representative, told BHB in an interview. “It’s only the state taking care of these people because, if it wasn’t us, they wouldn’t be in a private hospital.\n\n“We take on the most complex cases, and we’re the end of the line for a lot of these patients.”\n\nDSHS entered the private market to buy a facility that Acadia Healthcare Co. Inc. (Nasdaq: ACHC) shuttered in Tukwila, Washington. In August, DSHS bought the facility for $30 million, according to the Seattle Times.\n\nThe facility will convert to exclusively serving civil patients after they’ve resolved their obligations and care as forensic patients, Hemstreet said. The move adds more beds to the state hospital system. But, because of that, they will no longer be available to private patients. It prevents the hospital from going unused and serving no purpose in the local health care economy.\n\n“While they (patients) are still getting some behavioral health care, the key role in the competency restoration evaluation is to send them back to court to face their charges,” Hemstreet said.", "source_domain": "bhbusiness.com"}

Why are they still illegal in Texas?", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Op-Eds Fentanyl test strips save lives. Why are they still illegal in Texas? | Opinion\n\nLast year, a fentanyl-contaminated batch of crack cocaine killed at least 12 people and led to 70 overdose 911 calls in just 72 hours in Austin. Such a tragedy underscores the gravity of Texas’ overdose crisis and should be a wakeup call to state lawmakers. Fortunately, there are tools — simple test strips that indicate whether a drug is tainted with a dangerous substance like fentanyl — that help people make safer choices when it comes to substance use and reduce their overdose risk. Unfortunately, those tools are illegal in Texas.\n\nBut a new piece of legislation, introduced by a Republican state representative, could change this and save countless Texans’ lives.\n\nIllicit drug use has never been completely safe — an unregulated supply means there’s minimal transparency or quality control. But a decade ago, when I was conducting field work with people who used methamphetamine, my participants could assume their supply would be opioid-free. And those using heroin rarely worried that their usual dose would be 50 times stronger than expected.\n\nNow, however, the rise of synthetics has resulted in a market dominated by the highly potent opioid fentanyl, with a roster of novel adulterants — substances added to the drug supply to enhance experience, add weight or improve delivery efficiency — waiting in the wings.\n\nIndeed, recent research from many states, including Texas, found that up to 15% of stimulant samples now contain fentanyl, too. And the animal tranquilizer xylazine has made its way into the Texas supply.\n\nThese adulterants in the illicit supply are serious public health threats. People who primarily use stimulants or psychedelics often lack protective tolerance against fentanyl, making them especially vulnerable to an overdose. And, because fentanyl is so potent and fast-acting, even people who have used opioids for decades are at risk. Meanwhile, xylazine complicates overdose because it depresses breathing but does not respond to the overdose reversal medication naloxone.\n\nChecking drugs by using test strips, or more advanced technologies, to test a small amount of a drug for adulterants such as fentanyl or xylazine, can provide people with the information to make safer decisions about their drug use, reducing their overdose risk.\n\nTexas is one of just four holdout states in which possession, free distribution and sale of this life-saving equipment remains a crime.\n\nThat glaring legislative gap is likely part of why the state is seeing a smaller decline (about 10 percent) in overdose deaths relative to its neighbors (between 20 and 28 percent) — all of which have authorized some form of drug checking equipment — and the rest of the country.\n\nThis is why Texas State Rep. Tom Oliverson, a Republican and an anesthesiologist, has introduced a single, straightforward piece of legislation that could save a lot of lives. His effort is driving home the idea that the overdose crisis warrants pragmatic, health-based solutions, not partisan battles. The illicit drug market is constantly in flux, so saving lives means letting people check for a wide range of potential adulterants, not just the ones we know about. Rep. Oliverson’s bill includes language permitting the possession and distribution of equipment that tests for xylazine as well as fentanyl.\n\nAllowing people who use drugs to possess and community health organizations to distribute fentanyl and xylazine test strips will save lives. Texans who use drugs will be empowered to make safer choices and will have an opportunity to access much-needed health services. The evidence is clear: states should adopt the broadest drug checking legislation allowed by their political climate, and this bill is a massive step in the right direction.", "source_domain": "www.rstreet.org"}

{"url": "https://www.uchealth.org/today/geriatric-mental-health-resources-clinic-treats-neurologic-mental-health-disorders/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Often, signs of aging are obvious as time takes its inevitable toll. Shoulders slump forward. Joints groan. Hands tremble. Hair accumulates in brushes and combs.\n\nBut aging also plays out on a far less visible stage: the brain. The consequences may be creeping memory loss and slower cognition. Many people adapt to these neurologic changes on their own or with the help of loved ones. In others, however, changes in the brain progress to serious problems, including dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease, all of which may wreak havoc on their lives and loved ones.\n\nThese physical brain battles may, in turn, intertwine with psychiatric problems, like depression, anxiety and psychosis, and emotional demands posed by aging. It’s unwise to treat them separately, said Dr. Samantha Holden, assistant professor of Neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Holden practices at the UCHealth Neurology Clinic – Central Park, specializing in movement and cognition disorders.\n\n“It really is a false dichotomy to say, ‘This is neurologic and this is psychiatric and never the twain shall meet,’” Holden said. “It’s all your brain.”\n\nHolden noted, for example, that psychiatric issues like depression, apathy and anxiety frequently accompany Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurologic movement disorder. The clinical line between the two is blurry, at best, she said.\n\n“We have to make sure that we look at the whole person and see how your condition affects you and your well-being,” Holden said.\n\nGeriatric mental health resources\n\nHolden is part of a team that is doing just that. She joined last July with Drs. Karina Drake and Evan Plys to launch the Geriatric Mental Health Clinic, part of the UCHealth Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic – Anschutz Medical Campus. Holden, along with four other Neurology Clinic colleagues, refer patients they think will benefit from geriatric mental health resources to the clinic.\n\nDrake, an MD who completed a fellowship in geriatric psychiatry, helps patients safely balance their often complicated medication regimens, while also providing psychotherapy and other support. Plys, a PhD geropsychologist, focuses on individual therapy with patients who have mild or no impairment from their neurologic conditions. He also offered group therapy for caregivers last winter and spring and hopes to do so again in the fall.\n\nThe Geriatric Mental Health Clinic aims to help patients and their loved ones regain at least a measure of control over the disruption caused by their neurologic disorders. The challenges may be psycho-social: grief, anger, depression, and apathy over the idea of losing the life they anticipated to an incurable disease. Left untreated, these symptoms – the most common being depression and anxiety – can further deteriorate patients’ health, Plys said.\n\nIndividual therapy to restore meaning and purpose\n\n“Patients with these psychological concerns can have low motivation to engage in routine healthy behaviors, like exercise, diet and social engagement,” he said. “Particularly as we get older, it’s essential to engage in these behaviors. When we see mood becoming a barrier that is often a good time for people to come in for therapy.”\n\nPlys said he uses cognitive behavioral therapy to help patients identify the thoughts that create barriers to pursuing healthy habits and work on ways to overcome them. He described the sessions as collaborative, with patients developing “action plans” aimed at finding activities that produce a sense of meaning and purpose. Those are unique to each person: spending time with grandchildren, working in the garden, developing new hobbies, and connecting with old friends, for example. The idea is to build “mastery,” as Plys put it, over the mental disorders spurred by disease.\n\nThe process is not open-ended, Plys said. He typically starts patients with six, 50-minute sessions, then “renegotiates,” based on their progress toward meeting their goals.\n\n“The whole idea of therapy is to promote a patient’s function without a therapist,” he said. “I want to help you build skills and apply them to your own life. If I’ve done my job successfully, I’ve essentially made myself obsolete in the life of the patient.”\n\nMedication management for neurologic disorders is crucial\n\nSome patients Holden refers to the clinic suffer from acute changes in the brain that produce not only depression and anxiety but also psychosis, delusions, and hallucinations. In these cases, Drake works to evaluate and manage patients’ medications to safely treat both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. She said she also considers the “complex medical histories and cognitive disorders” that increasingly emerge as people age.\n\nDrake said she conducts a full psychiatric evaluation of symptoms, medical issues, the neurological workup, and the progression of the patient’s neurological disorder. She then develops a treatment plan to address each patient’s psychiatric issues, depending on the underlying cause. That may include referring a patient to Plys for individual therapy.\n\nA big part of Drake’s work is evaluating all the medications a patient is taking, because those prescribed for different problems may have dangerous interactions.\n\n“Polypharmacy can be a huge issue in older patients,” Drake said. “It’s important to know a patient’s updated medical issues, not only for prescribing medications, but sometimes deprescribing.”\n\nThe goal: eliminate medications that are redundant and those that produce unwanted side effects. She noted, for example, providers frequently prescribe benzodiazepines, such as Xanax and Valium, to treat anxiety. They produce short-term benefits, but also long-term side effects like changes in cognition and confusion.\n\n“The long-term risks of these medications increase as people age,” Drake said. “The question is how do we manage anxiety while working to get patients off these medications? It must be done slowly and cautiously.”\n\nDrake emphasized that her work forms an interdependent triangle of care with neurology and psychology.\n\n“We are working together to address the far-reaching effects of cognitive disorders,” she said. “We must approach the problem from multiple angles, given the complexities. Addressing one without the others is a losing battle.”\n\nA ‘gut punch’ diagnosis\n\nThe experience of Dennis and Sue Stretar of Aurora illustrates both the life-changing challenges presented by neurologic disease and mental health issues and the benefits of the collaborative care and resources provided by the Geriatric Mental Health Clinic.\n\nThe Stretars, now married for 26 years, met in 1994 through a “Sunday Night Club” for older singles through Colorado Free University. After marriage in 1995, they co-hosted “Colorado Today,” a public affairs program on KEZW-AM radio covering lifestyle and health-related aging issues that ran from 1999 to 2006. In 2002, they expanded the program to public television and print through a Health and Human Services grant. During this period, Sue survived a bout with breast cancer – chronicled in a documentary Dennis produced for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month – and made a complete recovery.\n\nDennis, now producer and host for the Aurora-based Our Community Broadcasting Network, noted that he and Sue worked extensively with the Alzheimer’s Association during their days with “Colorado Today.” That helped prepare them in 2010, when Sue’s mother, now 94, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“Between the two of us, we knew a lot about Alzheimer’s and dementia in general,” Dennis said.\n\nThen came another blow. In 2019, Sue, then only 63, began exhibiting signs of mental decline, including frequent rounds of confusion and forgetfulness.\n\n“She’d suddenly be in the fog and very quizzical about what was going on and what she was supposed to be doing,” Dennis said.\n\nHe recalled a key incident that occurred on a morning he needed to pick up their car from a local repair shop. He woke Sue up to remind her to drive him over, then went back to his office to wait for her to get ready. He heard her go down the stairs, then listened to the sound of the garage door going up and the car pulling away. Startled, he waited about 10 minutes for her to return, with the explanation that she thought Dennis was going to make a long, cold-morning walk to the repair shop to meet her.\n\nAfter more instances of forgetfulness that she frequently blamed on Dennis, Sue finally conceded that there was a problem they needed to address. The two met with a neurologist, who verified that she had a memory issue. After a lengthy battery of tests, she received a diagnosis of dementia, which Dennis described as “a gut punch.”\n\nDementia and depression form an explosive combination\n\nThe problem was to worsen, as neurology and psychiatry crossed paths. Sue had also managed clinical depression for 30 years. But in March 2020, she began experiencing violent hallucinations, delusions and bouts of paranoia, Dennis recounted. In one particularly frightening encounter, her neurologist witnessed Sue “coming apart before her very eyes,” he said. Sue received prescriptions for anti-psychotic medications, but by May 2020, Dennis said, she was close to needing hospitalization.\n\nFortunately, Sue received a referral to Holden for further treatment of her dementia. He and Sue met in December 2020 with her for a complete evaluation, but it was a rocky encounter. Dennis described Sue’s behavior as “very hostile,” and Holden’s recommendation as blunt.\n\n“Dr. Holden told me after that session that unless we can Sue’s mood enhanced, we won’t be effective in treating her [dementia],” Dennis said.\n\nWith that, Holden referred Sue to Drake, who met with the Stretars via Zoom in January 2021. Dennis said the collaboration between the two specialists was crucial.\n\n“Dr. Drake came in knowing what Sue was dealing with,” he said. After evaluating Sue, Drake prescribed a combination of medications for anxiety and clinical depression. With that issue handled, Holden prescribed Aricept, a medication to bolster cognition in early-onset Alzheimer’s patients. Dennis said Aricept, while not a cure, has helped Sue improve her short-term memory retention and moderate her confusion.\n\n“The meds are working fine. I would call her very stable,” Dennis said.\n\nNeurologic disorders: Adapting to a new way of life\n\nHe is clear-eyed about the challenges that lie ahead, however. He recognizes that Sue will withdraw at times and enter periods of confusion that he describes as “the fog rolling in.” He accepts that she will no longer connect with friends of longstanding and that he “can’t push her to do that.”\n\nDennis strives to find ways to help both adapt to their new reality. They go out to eat, walk the dogs, and stroll through open malls to watch kids play in fountains. Sue loves to garden, so Dennis expanded the flowerbeds around the house to encourage that. He even went a bit against the conventional advice to keep people with dementia away from crowds and high-intensity situations by taking Sue to a Colorado Rockies game. He did so cautiously, purchasing club-level seats that would give them easy escape if she panicked. That went so well that in late July they attended another game, where she mingled with crowds in the rooftop section of Coors Field.\n\nAs important as it is to support loved ones with neurologic and cognitive issues, Dennis added, caregivers must take care of themselves.\n\n“You have to avoid at all costs giving up your own personality, your likes and your loves,” he said. “Find something that is yours that is away from the caregiving issue.”\n\nIn his case, he finds time to visit old friends himself, usually in the mornings while Sue sleeps. “I need socialization,” Dennis said simply.\n\nHe credits Holden and Drake for helping to stabilize a situation that can be untenable for patients and caregivers who lack resources.\n\n“The concept of coordinated care is very important, and the time for it is now,” Dennis said. “Dr. Holden and Dr. Drake are the best of the best when it comes to [that].”\n\nGeriatric mental health resources: An increasingly important service in an aging world\n\nHolden said the Geriatric Mental Health Clinic fills a vital need for an aging population still wary of admitting the need for counseling and therapy. Fears of mental deterioration loom large in the imaginations of the elderly, she said.\n\n“If my brain is threatened, that’s existential in a way that no other health condition is,” Holden said.\n\nToo often in the past, she added, treatable mental health issues deteriorated to the point where admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was the final option.\n\n“We see the clinic having overall benefits for quality of life,” Holden said. “We’re bringing psychiatry more into the fold of the normal standard of care.”", "source_domain": "www.uchealth.org"}
{"url": "https://www.uchealth.org/today/helping-patients-with-opioid-addiction-move-on-to-recovery/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "The central act of Larry Harrison’s day is to tip back a couple of ounces of liquid that tastes like pink cough syrup. On this day in early December, he has ridden a half hour in a white Helping Hands minivan from an apartment halfway across town to do so. He did the same thing yesterday; he will do it again tomorrow.\n\nThe pink liquid contains a precise dose of methadone – in Harrison’s case, 130 milligrams of it. Methadone binds to the same brain receptors as opioids such as heroin, cutting cravings and quelling withdrawal symptoms that, in Harrison’s case, “get so bad I wish I was dead.”\n\nHarrison, 50, has been sober for two years now. He has been clean thanks to a collaboration between UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital on the Anschutz Medical Campus and the University of Colorado School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry program called ARTS – Addiction Research and Treatment Services. Since 2018, UCHealth specialists have been identifying inpatients with substance-use disorders and enrolling them; ARTS, which has been helping those with addiction since 1972, takes it from there. While one can’t know what would have happened to Harrison otherwise, he has an idea.\n\n“I had been on an 11-year heroin binge,” he says. “I was killing myself with heroin.”\n\nHarrison, who was homeless for much of those 11 years, has come close before, overdosing a handful of times to the point he stopped breathing and turned blue. Abscesses have left deep scars on his forearms and lower legs and required skin grafts on his shoulders. The infections developed because he resorted to injecting under the skin rather than into veins so destroyed from years of puncturing three to four times a day that, when hospitalized, nurses have had to put IVs in his forehead, he says.\n\nHe has been hospitalized a lot. Asked how much time he’s spent in inpatient beds over the past decade-plus, he estimates: “Three years.”\n\nA thousand days, give or take. Dirty needles brought infection after infection, and most stays involved intravenous antibiotics and observation that went on for a couple of weeks or longer. He has suffered three major and six minor strokes which have long been tied to heroin addiction (often, endocarditis – another affliction common among intravenous drug users – is the trigger). The strokes have left his left arm and leg weakened and the left side of his face partially paralyzed. He moves slowly. He tires easily. He walks with a cane.\n\nOpioid addiction: A ‘Slave to the molecule’\n\nHarrison is far from alone in suffering irreparable damage from what he describes as “chasing the dragon” of opioid addiction. In fiscal 2019-20, ARTS treated about 1,500 outpatients among its three clinics, and ARTS’s Potomac Street clinic that Harrison frequents is one of 28 opioid treatment centers statewide. They’re all working to slow the growing damage the opioid epidemic continues to do. Colorado saw about 1,500 deaths from drug overdoses in 2020 – up 38% from the previous year. Opioids caused more than half of them, with fentanyl being the prime culprit. Nationally, more than 75,000 people died of opioid overdoses in 2020 – nearly twice the 42,000 U.S. automotive fatalities that year.\n\nWhile opioid addiction is a vexing problem, the solutions are well understood. Forcing someone who’s addicted to go cold turkey is not one of them. The gold standard is called medication-assisted treatment, and that’s what Larry Harrison is doing through ARTS. MAT recognizes that opioids can change brain chemistry in ways that overwhelm conscious resistance and that pharmaceuticals such as methadone and buprenorphine are often crucial to long-term recovery. But getting off opioids is about more than prescription drugs.\n\nDr. Tyler Coyle, a CU School of Medicine psychiatrist and addiction specialist at ARTS, put it this way: “Your brain just becomes a slave to the molecule, and you are not able to break free. It doesn’t matter if you have children; it doesn’t matter if you have willpower of iron. You can’t do it on your own. You need a whole team.”\n\nIn a 2020 Colorado Health Institute report, opioid experts also cited inpatient, residential, and outpatient treatment as well as “recovery supports” as being vital levers in tackling the opioid crisis. Those recovery supports include access to housing, health care and other resources – from counseling to reliable rides to methadone clinics – designed to promote recovery.\n\nRoot cause of UCHealth-ARTS connection for patients with opioid addiction\n\nARTS has been doing all this for years. UCH and has been treating patients for infections and other maladies caused by opioid addiction for years. It wasn’t until Dr. Susan Calcaterra arrived at UCH in 2018 that the UCHealth-ARTS connection happened.\n\nCalcaterra, who directs UCH’s Addiction Medicine Consultation Service, came from Denver Health, where one of those 28 opioid treatment centers happens to be. She saw how the typical cycle of treating the medical maladies of those addicted to opioids and then sending them back out on the street to use drugs again, get infected again, and land in the hospital again could be broken. Infections looked like a health problem, but they were really just symptoms of the deeper disease of opioid addiction.\n\nHer inquiries led her to ARTS Director Angela Bonaguidi, and soon Calcaterra was training as an opioid treatment provider – a precondition for enrolling patients in methadone programs. State Opioid Response Grant money channeled through ARTS would pay for a slice of her time far thinner than that which she would commit.\n\nThe program works like this. When someone with substance-use disorder gets admitted, Calcaterra visits them, assesses them, and asks if they’re interested in being a part of ARTS’s drug-treatment program.\n\nShe’ll tell them things like, “I’m here to offer you a couple of things. It’s up to you whether you want to take them. My goal is to make you feel a little bit better. And, by the way, you matter,” she explains.\n\nFor many, she says, the chaos and uncertainty of day-to-day survival has been too great a barrier to overcome. They haven’t even considered treatment programs. If they choose to participate – and often they do, as was the case on a recent Friday, when Calcaterra enrolled three patients – Calcaterra signs them up and brings in UCHealth nurse Emma Maki-Gianani, a specialist in case management and substance-use counseling. Maki-Gianani spends about four hours with the patient working through the details of their lives, explaining the ARTS program, and dealing with a lot of enrollment paperwork.\n\nThe descent into opioid addiction\n\nWith Larry Harrison, that session and the ones that followed educated him on the path forward as he educated her on what he had been through. Following a childhood in and out of foster care, a telephone-sales job in Oklahoma City turned quickly into a telephone-sales management job. He later worked for years as a property manager. He married, had two kids, and was approaching his 40s in a stable, middle-class life when, in the late-2000s, kidney stones led to an overzealous Percocet prescription, and the sorts of pill mills that have made the Sacklers infamous finished the job. The opioid addiction that roared in unraveled his life.\n\nHe, his then-wife, and two kids – a 12-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter – came to Colorado as the weather turned cold in 2011. Robbed of what valuables they had at the bus station, they were forced to beg at intersections. Harrison resorted to selling drugs. Someone called the state Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, and the kids were soon back in Oklahoma with his wife’s sister. He hadn’t seen them since, he told Maki-Gianani. He had been in and out of jail, in and out of hospitals, living in a vacant lot behind a Taco Bell near Interstate 225 and Peoria Street and lots of other places no one imagines themselves ever having to live, and propelled from hour to hour and day to day more or less solely by a primordial drive to feed his insatiable opioid receptors.\n\nCalcaterra emphasizes the importance of empathy and being nonjudgmental. Harrison saw that immediately, he recalls.\n\n“They actually care – I was so blown away by it,” he says. “I’m at a place where they care about me and won’t just throw me back out on the street. If you treat and then just let them go, they’re right back where they were. It’s kind of hard for anybody to be productive when they’re sleeping under a tree or in a mud puddle.”\n\nOnce enrolled, the patient can start on an effective dose of methadone while in the hospital. That’s important because methadone takes time to settle in, so having a good start prior to discharge boosts the odds of the patient staying with ARTS and away from used needles. UCH becomes a smooth on-ramp into the outpatient program.\n\n“For me, it’s been very rewarding, Calcaterra says. “We’re actually treating the underlying cause for their hospitalization – the opioid use disorder which led to their infection or endocarditis. We used to send them on their way without ever addressing the underlying reason they were in the hospital.”\n\nCost, benefit of a partnered opioid treatment program for inpatients\n\nFor Harrison, that program included a year at Christopher House in Wheat Ridge and, since December 2020, “recovery supports” including a furnished apartment in south Denver, counseling, transportation, and the ARTS clinic, among other services.\n\nUltimately, that costs public money, and that gets us into politics. A commenter below a Denver Post article on methadone treatment summed up the instinctive resentment many feel: “Taxpayers must pay for more treatment options for junkies/addicts so they don’t/wont feel bad withdrawing… taxpayers shouldn’t foot the bill for weak people’s risky behavior!”\n\nDr. Joshua Barocas, a CU School of Medicine and UCHealth infectious-disease specialist and addiction researcher, has heard those arguments. They’re fueled by a belief that, as he puts it, “Substance-use disorders and addiction are so stigmatized, and we think of it as the fault of the person – that this is a choice. People in the general population believe that we shouldn’t be willing to pay as much.” His research focuses on health care cost-benefit analyses of addiction treatment.\n\n“We have evolved so much as a society that we have to make an economic argument,” he says. “It’s not enough these days to say, ‘It’s the right thing to do.’ We need to pull people into the conversation by saying, ‘Look, this actually is not only the right thing to do because we’re human beings. If that’s not enough for you, we can show that this is economically cost-effective compared to what we’ve been doing.’”\n\nThe results of a recent Barocas-led study found addiction treatment programs such as ARTS to be vastly cheaper than, for example, familiar therapies for chronic health problems such as diabetes. Those figures don’t include other societal costs such as those associated with crime reduction.\n\nThe health care savings from getting people who inject drugs into long-term recovery can be astronomical. In addition to the sort of care Harrison needed, HIV is spread through those injections, Barocas reminds.\n\n“If you prevent one HIV infection, you save $2 million in lifetime medical costs,’’ he says. “If I pay your rent for three months or three years, and that intervention gets you stabilized on buprenorphine or methadone, gets you a job and prevents you from getting HIV – isn’t that investment worth it? Even if you don’t care about the ethical side?”\n\nCoyle added that MAT keeps addiction treatment in the preventive realm, where it can be managed with medications in much the same way that diabetes is managed with insulin or asthma with inhalers.\n\n“That ends up making a huge difference in the health care costs, and the health care costs trickle down to everybody,” he says. “It helps people be the best versions of themselves. And that’s what we want because it’s going to benefit everybody.”\n\nPatients with opioid addiction get back to life\n\nIt has certainly benefitted Larry Harrison. When he feels like he can handle it, he will start to taper his daily methadone dose down from 130 milligrams to, eventually, zero. But just as Calcaterra gave Harrison the choice to enter the ARTS program two years ago, the ARTS team is leaving that timing up to him.\n\n“Having a voice has been a pivotal part of my transition,” Harrison said.\n\nHe is grateful to both organizations.\n\n“I was on the street. I was so filthy. I was worse than a person living in a garbage can. And I was treated the same way by society, by everybody. But UCH, there’s something different about that hospital. They’re treating these drug addicts like human beings: ‘What do you think?’ ‘How do you feel?’ ‘How are we going to get through this together?’ They said, ‘We’re actually going to treat the problem.’”\n\nWith the basics of food, shelter, and MAT taken care of, Harrison has been sober for two years. As he works through his own transition to recovery, he hopes to start peer-counseling others just starting theirs.\n\n“The whole transformation just has been so easy on me,” he says. “I’ve gone from being on the streets for 11 years to being on a path towards becoming a productive member of society again.”\n\nFrom ethical, societal, and economic perspectives, that’s good news for us all.", "source_domain": "www.uchealth.org"}

Last year, “Crush the Crisis” take back events collected 15,566 pounds of unused or expired medication, approximately 10.7 million doses.\n\nTo further help combat the nation’s opioid crisis, HCA Healthcare has worked with the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic. HCA Healthcare has given $750,000 to the Collaborative to support the development of safer pain management protocols and the reversal of the opioid crisis.\n\nAs a learning health system, HCA Healthcare uses data from approximately 35 million annual patient encounters to help continuously improve care. The organization uses the science of “big data” to reduce opioid misuse and transform pain management, with initiatives in surgical, emergency and other care settings, including:\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR): a multi-modal approach to pain management using pre, intra and post-operative interventions to optimize outcomes. HCA Healthcare’s ESR programs have demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and patient satisfaction, including up to a 44 percent decrease in opioid usage for targeted complex surgeries.\n\nElectronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS): aims to stem increasing rates of opioid-related addiction, misuse diversion and death by making it more difficult for medication-seekers to doctor-shop and alter prescriptions. Physicians have access to aggregated electronic health records, providing data that will allow them to prescribe opioids judiciously.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

Among the trio of FDA-approved medications to treat OUD, buprenorphine is the newest highly effective drug that can suppress and reduce cravings for opioids.\n\nThe latest drug approved by the FDA to fight Opioid Use Disorder is being examined for its side effect on dental health. Image courtesy: GettyImages\n\nIt is also the first medication that physicians can prescribe without requiring a special waiver from the DEA, enabling outpatient use and substantially increasing treatment accessibility.\n\nDespite its widespread usage, with 1 million buprenorphine prescriptions filled in 2018, it is not without side effects. When taken sublingually (under the tongue), buprenorphine has been linked to dental health problems. While the exposure of oral fluids to opioid analogs is well-known, this lesser-known side effect has recently raised serious concerns.\n\n“In January of 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning, emphasizing that the use of sublingual buprenorphine formulations is linked to serious dental health problems,” said Ming Hu, Diana S-L. Chow Endowed Professor of Drug Discovery and Development, at the UH College of Pharmacy. Hu and his team have secured $1.4 million from the National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research to address this serious side effect.\n\nMing Hu, Diana S-L. Chow Endowed Professor of Drug Discovery and Development at the UH College of Pharmacy, is leading a team exploring counter measures to oral buprenorphine.\n\nHu is optimistic that his team can unravel the reasons behind excessive saliva exposure to buprenorphine following sublingual use. By gaining a comprehensive understanding behind excessive oral exposure to buprenorphine, the team’s goal will be to develop a countermeasure that addresses the dental health problems associated with the use of oral buprenorphine formulations.\n\n“It poses a significant concern for individuals with opioid use disorder as the available pharmacotherapy options for this population are very limited,” said Hu.\n\nHu’s team is comprised of multiple-PI for this grant, Dr. Bing-Yang Wang, UTHealth Houston School of Dentistry; and from the UH College of Pharmacy, Rashim Singh in the Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences and Douglas Thornton, director of the PREMIER Center.", "source_domain": "www.uh.edu"}

He was 37.\n\nEubanks was found in his home in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and his death confirmed by a coroner on Saturday.\n\nThough the cause of death was not known ahead of an autopsy on Monday, Eubanks’ family told the local ABC TV station, Denver 7, he had “lost the battle with the very disease he fought so hard to help others face.\n\n“Helping to build a community of support is what meant the most to Austin,” they said, “and we plan to continue his work.”\n\nEubanks’ death came less than a month after the 20th anniversary of the Columbine massacre in which 12 pupils and a teacher were killed by two students.\n\nView image in fullscreen On 25 April 1999, Eubanks hugs his girlfriend during a memorial service in Littleton, Colorado. Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP\n\nHe was in the library of the high school on 20 April 1999 when the two shooters entered. Ten students, including Eubanks’ best friend Corey DePooter, died before the gunmen turned their firearms on themselves. One student died later.\n\nEubanks, then 17, was shot in the hand and knee. He once said that though in hindsight his injuries were not that severe he was prescribed prescription medicines to control the pain and within three months had become addicted.\n\nHe said the dependency was not so much physical but emotional. In a 2016 interview with Denver 7 he said: “I didn’t know any better. I was 17 years old, and I had been given medication to feel better.\n\n“Immediately I learned that if I took substances, I didn’t have to feel, I didn’t have to feel the emotional pain.”\n\nIt took him 12 years to find a way out of addiction, and after that he used his dramatic personal story to try and help others fight drug dependency. He became a prominent expert on addiction and drug policy, travelling the country to advise those going through trauma that it is better to face emotions than dull them behind painkillers, as he did.\n\nAfter the mass shooting in Parklands, Florida, in February last year, he had a message for his fellow survivors: “With emotional pain, in order to heal it, you have to feel it.\n\n“It’s not like a physical injury that you can medicate and still recover. In order to heal emotional pain, you have to be present and you have to go through the stages of grief.”", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com"}

The center, a subpart of Dell Medical School’s clinical practice UT Health Austin, provides mental health services for ACC students.\n\n“We’ve always had mental health challenges, but with the pandemic, I think it has really significantly gotten worse,” said Ruth Reinhart, ACC associate vice chancellor of student support services. “There’s a big need for this kind of support.”\n\nThe Amplify Center was created to “redesign mental health services to make them more accessible, engaging and relevant to young people,” according to the UT Health Austin website. Reinhart said if students have milder mental health needs, ACC’s regular clinical counseling team will assist them instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReinhart said students who show onset symptoms of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia would receive help at the Amplify Center, while students who suffer from anxiety would be serviced at ACC’s regular clinic.\n\nSince its opening less than two weeks ago, Reinhart said operations have been successful and helpful.\n\n“(Staff at the Amplify Center) are busy,” Reinhart said. “I think they were a little surprised because our student population is quite different than UT’s student population … It’s been very important for us to have that to support our students in that space. It’s been great, we’re very grateful for our partnership because we know it’s really going to help our students.”\n\nDell Medical School opened the center as a pilot program with the goal to duplicate and expand throughout Austin, said Deborah Cohen, executive director of the center.\n\nWhile care through the Amplify Center is currently free, the center plans to begin billing insurance while aiming to keep services at a low cost, said Cohen, co-director for Dell Medical School’s Center for Youth Mental Health.\n\n“What we’re working on right now is the financial sustainability of the model,” Cohen said. “And so that is what will determine if we’re able to extend out to a larger community.”\n\nWhile Dell Medical School funded the clinic through grants and philanthropy such as donations from the Susan and Michael Dell Foundation, Reinhart said ACC provided Dell Medical School with the office space for the Amplify Center.\n\n“Mental health used to be a stigma, and I’m very proud of our society that we’re talking more and more about it,” Reinhart said. “Giving students the access and letting them know that we care … is really important.”", "source_domain": "thedailytexan.com"}

His consciousness existed in a black nothingness, a space that made him feel as if he could start over, like an empty house waiting for new furniture.\n\nAnd afterward, Novikoff felt an emotional “spark” that he hadn’t felt in months.\n\nNovikoff, 60, was “dopey” all day after that first ketamine treatment, but as the hours went by, he felt his depression lifting. The heavy weight that hung over him was a bit lighter. The urge to kill himself slowly subsided.\n\nThe former computer consultant is one of 15 patients undergoing treatment at the Mental Health Center of Denver’s ketamine clinic, the only such clinic in the state at a community mental health center and one of few in the nation for low-income patients.\n\nThe Federal Drug Administration approved the use of esketamine — a version of the drug ketamine that is twice as potent — for people with “treatment-resistant depression” in 2019, the first new medicine for depression in decades. While some private-practice therapists in Colorado offer the treatment, and a host of clinics have opened around the country, it’s still hard to come by for those who can’t afford to pay or lack private insurance.\n\nEric Novikoff, 60, demonstrates self-administered esketamine nasal spray. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America) Esketamine doses range from 56 to 84 milligrams, taken anywhere from twice a week to monthly. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nThe low-profile success of this form of ketamine to treat Colorado patients with severe depression comes as state policymakers scrutinize the use of ketamine outside of hospitals after the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, who was placed in a chokehold by Aurora police and then injected with the tranquilizing drug. It also comes as Denver narrowly voted in 2019 to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and some policymakers want to make mushrooms legal statewide.\n\nAfter getting the go-ahead from the FDA, the community mental health center stepped into esketamine treatment cautiously, beginning with just two patients in late 2020. The first two men came twice a week for about two months before the clinic opened up to more patients. Now, there are 15 patients receiving regular treatments at the mental health center’s east Denver offices and about as many on a waiting list.\n\nNurses who run the clinic are thrilled to see patients who have suffered for years find some relief, and hope the program can expand.\n\nPatients who come in for their weekly or twice-weekly doses of esketamine, delivered as a nasal spray, can choose one of a handful of rooms to ride out the high. Each has comfy chairs and partitions to separate them from other patients, and one has a wall of windows overlooking a parking lot and, farther away, rows of Denver homes and lawns. Some patients prefer no windows and darkness.\n\nEvery treatment begins with a patient filling out a PHQ-9, a nine-part questionnaire that gauges mental health status, and a nurse checking their blood pressure. A patient takes one up-the-nose dose of esketamine, then a second dose about five minutes later. After 40 minutes, a nurse checks their blood pressure again, and returns regularly to assess for nausea and make sure any hallucinations and psychosis are under control. Side effects noted by the FDA include increased blood pressure, vomiting, vertigo and anxiety.\n\nSome patients report superhuman hearing, like to the point of hearing their blood rushing through their veins or a conversation between a staff member and a patient several rooms away. Everyone hallucinates or experiences some disassociation.\n\nWe have some folks, actually, that have very pleasant psychosis. Denise Hosier, nurse practitioner\n\n“We have some folks, actually, that have very pleasant psychosis,” said Denise Hosier, the mental health center’s clinical director of nurse practitioners. One woman always chooses the room with all the windows. “We’ll check on her, and I’m like, ‘How you feeling today?’ and she is watching some bunnies in the trees, just very pleasant.”\n\nOne man listens to Pink Floyd’s The Wall during his treatment. “He’s like, ‘I think I just had a really great trip,’” Hosier recalled. “They feel like they’re really drunk. Or they say, ‘I kind of feel high.’”\n\nPatients are required to stay a full two hours and can’t drive themselves home. So far, only two have quit the treatments — one was a petite woman who got extremely nauseated from the drug, while the other was a large man who reported feeling nothing.\n\nDue to esketamine heightening one’s senses, Novikoff often brings an eye mask, blanket, and noise-cancelling headphones to his 2-hour treatments. “I’ve had some very interesting enhanced sense experiences, like hearing the blood flowing in my body,” Novikoff said. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nNo one has had a frightening psychotic episode that was dangerous to staff, Hosier said. To avoid this, nurses will talk to patients when they arrive and spend extra time helping them decompress if they’ve had an upsetting or anxiety-provoking day. A bit more time to calm down leads to a more pleasant trip.\n\nPatients typically start by coming twice per week, then drop that to weekly and then, eventually, every other week. All of them have reported decreased depression over time, some almost instantly or within a few hours. After three or four days, it wears off and patients are ready for another treatment, Hosier said. Everyone starts at the lowest dose 56 milligrams of Spravato, the brand name for esketamine, and can move up to 84 milligrams as their treatment continues.\n\n“It doesn’t stay in their system for long or make them groggy for days after,” she said.\n\nPatients can continue as long as it’s still working. The esketamine treatment costs about $2,500 per person per month, which is reimbursed at about 75% by Medicaid, Medicare or private insurance.\n\nResearchers have studied using ketamine, which was used by hospitals as an anesthetic during surgeries, to treat depression for the past two decades. Scientists at Yale University found that more than half of patients showed a significant decrease in depression 24 hours after a ketamine treatment, and these were patients who had no improvement after multiple antidepressant medications.\n\nKetamine pushes the brain to make new neural connections, giving patients the opportunity to form more positive thoughts and behaviors, according to Yale researchers.\n\nNurse practitioner Denise Hosier poses for a portrait at the Mental Health Center of Denver. “We’ve seen some really great improvements in people that have not had any success. … They’re more social. They find they had an affect of [being] very flat and didn’t react to things — now they’re laughing with family, they’re able to laugh at shows and movies. They just find more joy in their lives in general.” (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nFor most patients, it’s a last-ditch attempt to recover after months or years of depression that prescription medications could not cure. Patients are eligible to try esketamine only after at least two failed antidepressant medications, according to the FDA.\n\nNovikoff tried six.\n\nBy the time he confided in his primary care doctor that he was severely depressed, Novikoff already had a plan to kill himself. He’d gone through a breakup, the death of his father, the end of a computer company he jointly operated, and then the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfraid of what he might do, Novikoff told his doctor of his suicide plan, and his doctor called him every three hours on a Friday night to make sure he was OK. He also set him up with an appointment at the mental health center.\n\nFor the next few months, Novikoff tried multiple antidepressants, but none worked. Plus, the side effects, including feeling drugged and not being able to urinate, were unbearable. Then his mental health center psychiatrist suggested the esketamine clinic, which at the time was just about to take on patients. Novikoff got his first treatment in January 2021.\n\nFor him, it was a spiritual experience, one that — combined with therapy to unpack the meaning of him floating in a vacuum — helped him improve his mental health.\n\n“Depression feels like a weight. Like there’s an elephant sitting on you; that slows everything down,” Novikoff said. “When that weight lifts, all of a sudden, you can just be — instead of suffering.” (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America) The PHQ-9, or Patient Health Questionnaire 9, assesses a patient’s current degree of depressive symptoms before each esketamine session. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\n“I was able to really look at my life and realize, OK, you know, some things have gone badly, some things have gone really well and I’ve given it a good shot, versus the depressed me with like, ‘Everything’s ruined. There’s no future,’” he said. “That void place was like a spring in my consciousness for me. And when I came back, I felt completely changed. I felt I could still feel that depressed feeling in the next few days, but there was like a little spark that was growing.”\n\nIn one session, the question, “Who is here?” appeared in the void, Novikoff said. So he tackled that one during therapy.\n\n“That gave me the idea of reviewing my life with compassion,” he said. “Ketamine can make you feel loved, peaceful. And so it’s easier to be compassionate when you look at your mistakes.”\n\nAnother time, the words in the void were “trust the process.”\n\n“That felt really relaxing, like there is a path and I just need to go down the path,” he said. “I don’t have to fight it. I don’t have to push forward. I just need to go down the path.”\n\nThe treatments have been so life-changing that Novikoff has given up on the tech industry, which never made him happy, and is enrolled in Naropa University graduate program to become a mental health counselor.\n\nDue to esketamine heightening one’s senses during treatment, Novikoff often brings an eye mask, blanket, and noise-cancelling headphones and will assume a meditative position during treatments. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nHe gets esketamine treatments every other week, usually while listening to relaxing music by Liquid Mind. The scores on his PHQ-9 have dropped from a worrisome 18 points to a 3 or 4, and he feels an emotional connection to life that he hadn’t felt in years, he said.\n\n“When I was depressed, I felt like I was kind of running the clock out,” he said. “That moment where I decided to kill myself was a low point, and I feel like I’ve been going up ever since. And the ketamine, by taking me out of that box I put myself in … it was like the box just disappeared, like hey, you still have a chance to be whatever you want to be.”", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com"}

Kennedy, Jr. over the unlawful termination of $11 billion in critical public health funding. Beginning on March 24, 2025, HHS abruptly, with no advance notice or warning, issued termination notices to state and local public health agencies across the country, purporting to end federal funding for grants that provide essential support for a wide range of urgent public health needs, including identifying, tracking, and addressing infectious diseases; ensuring access to immunizations; and modernizing critical public health infrastructure. The federal funding was appropriated by Congress to ensure the United States is better prepared for future public health threats. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, the lawsuit by the attorneys general alleges that the termination notices are unlawful in several ways under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The coalition is also seeking a temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo and immediately restore the public health funding due to the irreparable harm that their respective states and their local health jurisdictions would otherwise suffer. California stands to lose more than $972 million from these cancellations by HHS.\n\n“Over and over, I’ve made clear that my office will only take legal action against the Trump Administration when it breaks the law. Unfortunately, but predictably, that has happened once again,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Congress explicitly authorized funding for the grants at issue to help keep our country healthy and protect us from future pandemics. HHS and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., cannot unilaterally do away with that critical federal funding. My fellow attorneys general and I are committed to defending the rule of law. We know how high the stakes are in our respective states — thousands of jobs and key public health programs and initiatives could be eliminated.”\n\nAccording to the Trump Administration, funding for the grants is “no longer necessary” because the grants were appropriated through one or more COVID-19 related laws, and the COVID-19 pandemic is over. In the lawsuit, the attorneys general allege:\n\nThe termination notices violate the APA because they are contrary to law. The foreseeable end of the COVID-19 pandemic is not a lawful basis to terminate “for cause.” Terminations “for cause” are only permissible based on a grant recipient’s “material failure” to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of the grants and agreements. The Trump Administration has never alleged, much less demonstrated, any failure by the fund recipients to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of the grants and agreements. In addition, federal law requires the HHS Secretary to “provide to the State involved adequate notice and an opportunity for a hearing” prior to terminating Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) grants, which fund mental health and substance abuse services. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. provided absolutely no notice or opportunity for a hearing before terminating the grants, effective immediately.\n\nThe termination notices further violate the APA because they are arbitrary and capricious. Among other things, they assumed, with no legal or factual support, that all appropriations in COVID-19 related laws were only intended for use during the pandemic. In fact, HHS granted numerous extensions to the performance period of many grants issued to Plaintiff States and their local health jurisdictions, some of which were scheduled to end as late as June 2027. The termination notices are also arbitrary and capricious because they failed to undertake any individualized assessments of the grants or cooperative agreements, including any analysis of the benefits of this public health funding or the dire consequences of termination.\n\nThe Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of funds has already caused substantial confusion and will result in immediate and devastating harm to their states, their local health jurisdictions, their residents, and public health writ large.\n\nWithout this essential public health funding, vital programs that serve millions of Californians, including children, rural communities, and nursing homes, will be jeopardized. For example, the federal government terminated over $800 million that the California Department of Public Health intended to use, in part, to vaccinate 4.5 million children statewide and assist hospitals in directing injured and ill patients to available health facilities during all types of emergencies, where efficient routing saves lives. The California Department of Health Care Services is set to lose over $119 million, which the state needs to support key programs, including substance use disorder prevention and early intervention services for youth in at least 18 counties. And the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health will lose over $45 million that was slated, in part, to strengthen the County’s efforts to prevent the spread of measles, and seasonal and avian influenza.\n\nAttorney General Bonta is co-leading the litigation with the attorneys general of Colorado, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Washington. They are joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Wisconsin, as well as the Governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.\n\nA copy of the complaint is available here.", "source_domain": "oag.ca.gov"}

Fortunately, there is a well-established, inexpensive medication that is guaranteed to alleviate the symptoms and reduce the risk of death by 50%.\n\nSurely you or your family member can access this medication readily, yes? If the diagnosis is opioid addiction, and that lifesaving medicine is methadone, the answer is unfortunately no.\n\nThis is the situation people with opioid use disorder (i.e. opioid addiction) who struggle with heroin, fentanyl or prescription pain medications and happen to live in many suburban and rural communities in Colorado face as they seek lifesaving treatment. Methadone, a medication developed in the 1940s, is the most effective medication for opioid use disorder.\n\nPatients who have struggled for years with opioid use say that methadone helps them feel normal and provides the stability needed to improve their lives. Despite the ongoing surge of preventable overdose deaths, access to this medication remains restricted due to outdated regulations that prohibit the use of methadone outside of specific clinics.\n\nMethadone’s restrictive regulations date back to the 1970s and the “War on Drugs.” People who want access to treatment are typically required to show up several times a week to federally licensed opioid treatment programs (“methadone clinics”) to be directly observed while taking methadone. There is little a patient can do if they miss doses because of family obligations, snow or illness except prepare for the inevitable and debilitating withdrawal symptoms.\n\nFurthermore, these programs are geographically concentrated in urban areas. Of Colorado’s 34 opioid-treatment programs, only five are located outside of the Front Range, creating a situation where patients would be required to drive hundreds of miles over a single week to access methadone treatment, according to a 2020 study. For many rural and suburban Coloradans, it is simply not feasible to engage in treatment while maintaining a job or caring for children or family members.\n\nFortunately, there is an opportunity to change the outdated laws governing methadone treatment currently in the U.S. Congress. The Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act, or M-OTAA, is bipartisan legislation that proposes to safely increase access to methadone treatment.\n\nWhile increasing flexibility for opioid treatment programs, M-OTAA will also allow addiction medicine specialists to prescribe methadone for patients to pick up at their local pharmacy, just as they do for most medications. The bill has been endorsed by all major addiction medicine societies including the American Society of Addiction Medicine and specifically empowers addiction medicine specialists to treat patients who may have limited access to methadone because of where they live.\n\nColorado Sen. John Hickenlooper serves on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and has supported the legislation. Now is the time for our other representatives to support this important legislation.\n\nDespite broad support for this legislation by national addiction medicine experts and 20-plus years of evidence showing that methadone is effective when given outside of regulated clinics, there remain vocal critics of this legislation. Some believe that the chemical properties of methadone and the intensive services offered in opioid treatment clinics are reasons to keep methadone limited. There is also concern for over-prescribing and repeating the prescription opioid overdose crisis of the early 2000s.\n\nWhile methadone, like many medications, can be dangerous if used inappropriately, highly trained addiction medicine specialists are well-suited to prescribe methadone in a safe and individualized manner. By removing outdated regulations, M-OTAA would help ensure that all Coloradans have access to safe and comprehensive addiction care from doctors, like us, who are experts in treating opioid use disorder.\n\nPeople could receive a prescription from an addiction medicine specialist in a regular office, just like other complex illnesses, and pick up their methadone from their local pharmacy, increasing privacy, reducing stigma, and eliminating the geographic disparities in access to high-quality, effective opioid use disorder treatment.\n\nBy supporting M-OTAA, our elected representatives can help expand access to lifesaving treatment for all Coloradans, regardless of where they live. As the overdose crisis continues to devastate communities throughout our state, maintaining the status quo for methadone treatment is untenable. We urge our elected representatives to support M-OTAA and increase access to high-quality addiction treatment.\n\nPaul Christine, MD, PhD, lives in Denver and is a primary care and addiction medicine physician and researcher.

In its notice to the state, the federal government said that because the COVID crisis was over, it would instead end all funding this month.\n\n“These grants were issued for a limited purpose: To ameliorate the effects of the pandemic. The end of the pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants are no longer necessary,” states an excerpt of the notification from SAMHSA shared by the Behavioral Health Administration.\n\nState officials greeted the news with dismay.\n\n“In so many cases, these are life-saving programs and services, and we worry for the wellbeing of those who have come to count on this support,” BHA spokeswoman Allie Eliot, wrote in an email to CPR News.\n\n“This sudden change impacts 60 programs across the state of Colorado that provide a wide range of services including: crisis resolution teams, services for adults with serious mental illness, peer services for Coloradans in recovery for substance use disorder, and support for young adults who have experienced an early onset of psychotic spectrum illness - just to name a few.”\n\nEliot said the Behavioral Health Administration is actively working with state leaders, the governor's office and the Colorado Attorney General’s Office to determine next steps.\n\nThe Department of Public Health and Environment said that the state is still trying to assess the full impact of the funding cuts on its programs, since some of the more than $200 million was intended to support local public health agencies and Tribal Nations. The money was slated to go to areas like addressing COVID-19 health disparities, vaccines for children and lab capacity for prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases.\n\n“We are concerned that this sudden loss of federal funding threatens Colorado’s ability to track COVID-19 trends and other emerging diseases, modernize disease data systems, respond to outbreaks, and provide critical immunization access, outreach, and education—leaving communities more vulnerable to future public health crises,” CDPHE spokeswoman Kristina Lodice said in an email.\n\nColorado lawmakers are already dealing with a $1.2 billion shortfall and are in the process of finalizing the state’s next budget, which must be balanced. It’s unclear how this federal funding cut will impact the state’s overall budget picture.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Emily Sirota, a budget committee member, said she thinks these cuts in federal funding are just the beginning.\n\n“These are millions of dollars of planned expenditures. They were planned for, contracted for, and are now being pulled back within the public health space, especially around immunization and disease detection work,” said Sirota.\n\nShe said Colorado doesn’t have the money to backfill the lost funding.\n\n“There will be very real consequences to real people in Colorado. And we are not going to be able to pick up all of the pieces. And so it's frightening.”\n\nAnother budget committee member, Democratic Sen. Judy Amabile worried about the consequences for Coloradans who rely on these programs.\n\n“People who are in desperate need of the services that they provide won't be able to get them and that will hurt them,” said Amabile.\n\nRep. Shannon Bird, vice-chair of the budget committee echoed that sentiment, and said without a partnership with the federal government, the state has no capacity to fund these programs in the way it has in the past.

Born with a form of cerebral palsy, he wore leg braces until the first grade, but now the 18-year-old is American Ninja Warrior’s third-ever million-dollar prize winner.\n\n\"When I started watching the show, I never would've thought that I would've been able to win the whole thing, especially with having to wear those leg braces and struggling to work on things like flexibility and all that,\" he tells PEOPLE. \"But if you put your mind to stuff like that, you can do pretty much whatever you want.\"\n\nWalker's win on the long-running NBC competition series, which dares contestants to complete extreme obstacle courses, also coincided with new challenges for this season, such as head-to-head racing to the \"Mega Wall,\" which at 18 and a half feet was taller than ever before.\n\nThe Texas-born competitor known as \"Walker Texas Ninja\" discusses how he's trained for ninja while coping with his disability, spastic diplegia — a form of cerebral palsy that mainly causes \"muscle stiffness\" in the legs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe winner says that although his spastic diplegia keeps his legs \"very tight and twitchy,\" it \"hasn't really affected his gameplay\" because he has \"done so much work outside of competing to compensate.\"\n\n\n\nVance Walker. Elizabeth Morris/NBC\n\nWalker dominated two seasons of American Ninja Warrior Junior, a children's version of the popular show in which he won every race in his age group, before competing in seasons 13–15 of ANW.\n\n\n\nThis year, he won the top prize after conquering all four stages at the National Finals in Las Vegas, beating ANW veteran and friend Daniel Gil by just over a second on Mount Midoriyama, an 80-foot tower with a 75-foot rope climb.\n\nWalker says he was an active kid and found an outlet with ninja.\n\n\"I always wanted to do sports, but I was never any good at a lot of them,\" he adds. \"I tried playing baseball and I tried playing soccer, but a lot of sports where you had to be on your legs the entire time, I wasn't very good at.\"\n\n\"The second I found ninja, I knew that that's what I wanted to do,\" he continues. \"I knew that that's what I wanted to fully focus on.\"\n\nHis journey to TV victory began in 2018 after he’d been practicing ninja for about three to four years, and he'd already won a national championship outside of the show. Once Walker heard that ANWJ was happening, he says he \"immediately\" applied with friends.\n\n\"Luckily, I think five of us from my gym that first season were able to make it on,\" he says. \"So my whole entire training squad was able to go on there together.\"\n\nHe adds, \"I had been training for a couple years at that point and doing well at the local competitions. I just decided to take it on the big show and see what I had.\"\n\nVance Walker. Elizabeth Morris/NBC\n\nWalker went on to impress during his rookie season on ANW in 2021, making it all the way to stage 3 of the finals. After nearly seven years in Atlanta, he moved to Houston, where he trained with Gil ahead of season 14. But several stunning defeats — leaving that season without hitting a single buzzer — pushed him to work even harder.\n\nAt 18, he decided to graduate high school early and move to Tampa, Florida, by himself ahead of season 15 to train with show veterans like R.J.

[I'm] still going to compete,\" he says, adding, \"I'm sticking around as long as I can.\"\n\nHis cerebral palsy community is also on the 18-year-old's mind.

A manual will be created as a guide for including patients with CP and their families in research,” she added.\n\n“This particular project is focused on patients with cerebral palsy and their families and early detection of CP,” Roberts said. “It will bring them together along with physicians, healthcare professionals and Early Childhood Intervention policy makers to plan a one-day hybrid conference in the fall of 2024 at Scottish Rite for Children.\n\nRoberts, an associate professor in the School of Occupational Therapy at Texas Woman’s who’s been researching cerebral palsy in children for nearly 20 years, received the award from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) , along with Angela Shierk, PhD, OTR from Scottish Rite for Children.\n\nFeb. 1, 2024 — DENTON —Seasoned researcher Heather Roberts is hoping a $100,000 award will significantly move the needle on early detection of cerebral palsy, and lead to better outcomes for patients and their families.\n\nHeather Roberts and Angela Shierk\n\n“What we continue to struggle with is how to get this research-based intervention into the hands of all the children who need it,” Roberts said. “It is not being implemented as a standard of care, and insurance is not covering the cost of it.”\n\nRoberts ran into similar issues with Therapy Together, a caregiver-led intervention for young children that have unilateral cerebral palsy or are at risk for developing unilateral cerebral palsy.\n\nIt was intended to be delivered within a standard of care model with the collaboration of the State of Texas Early Childhood Intervention.\n\n“Working with the State of Texas Early Childhood Intervention, we found that the children lack a diagnosis of cerebral palsy,” Roberts said. “Not having a diagnosis prevents them from receiving evidenced-based treatment, like CIMT. Early-detection guidelines exist and can diagnose CP as early as 3 months of age. But most of the time, children are not diagnosed until 3 or 4. An early diagnosis is key for optimal recovery. With all of that, we need to start at the ground level and gather all of the stakeholders: MD's, therapists, policy makers, educators, students and, most importantly, the patients and their families.”\n\nThat is why the PCORI award is instrumental. The award funds projects that are geared at bringing together all of the stakeholders, including patients, families, clinicians and policy makers, to participate in the entire research process.\n\n“This award will provide the resources that prevent many patients and their families with CP from participating in research,” Roberts said. “The funds will pay them for their time as consultants, gas, babysitting services or the internet to allow them to be able to be a voice at the table.”\n\nRoberts is planning on OT students being involved either as stakeholders or volunteers at the conference.

The 14-page lawsuit was filed last week in Douglas County Court, accuses officers of lying about the events surrounding the arrest and seeks a jury trial, compensation for Graham and for the officers to be held liable for excessive force.\n\nThe arrest in question occurred on Dec. 7, 2022 near Prairie Hawk Drive. The lawsuit says that officers Coyle and Longuevan frequently interacted with Graham on their patrols. The suit also says those officers knew Graham had cerebral palsy, which impacts his speech and physical abilities.\n\nThe officers say they believed Graham's motorhome's registration was expired and stopped him. During the approximately 30-minute interaction, the officers didn't appear to fear for their own safety, the lawsuit reads.\n\nDue to his cerebral palsy, the 34-year-old has difficulty placing his hands behind his back, which the officers didn't ask him to do in the first place, the lawsuit alleges, yet Graham \"never moved and never engaged in any action which any person could believe was dangerous or assaultive.\"\n\nThe officers accused Graham of being combative in their reports, with Longuevan saying Graham was \"squaring off\" with officers and Coyle writing that Graham \"took a fighting stance.\"\n\nA screenshot of dashcam footage shows three Castle Rock police officers taking Hayden Graham do the ground on Dec. 8, 2022. The arrest and tasing of Graham is the subject of a civil rights lawsuit against the officers filed on May 1, 2024. Courtesy / Castle Rock Police Department via Ascend Counsel\n\nThey took him to the ground while shouting \"stop resisting,\" and then shocked him with a taser.\n\nHe was arrested and charged with obstructing a police officer, resisting arrest and several charges related to the insurance and registration on his RV. He pled guilty to driving under restraint and the other charges were dismissed and he was ordered to pay $154 in fines.\n\nGraham's cerebral palsy stems from his mother dying while giving birth to him, he says: \"I wore leg braces, hand braces, my speech is kinda screwed up.\" At the time, oxygen wasn't going to his brain for three to four minutes. Born in 1990 to a 16-year-old runaway, he moved to Castle Rock in 2007 and has experienced homelessness over the last few years, he says.\n\nThe tasing and arrest, according to Graham, has worsened his condition.\n\n\"My seizures have increased, my mobility has gone down,\" he said. \"It definitely hurt. In my mind was like, 'oh, they're trying to kill me' (...) it was definitely a life-changing experience.\"\n\nGraham's attorney Milo Schwab told CBS News Colorado that the level of force was over the top and that the officers lied about Graham's behavior afterward.\n\n\"Taking him to the ground was unnecessary, tasing him was unnecessary,\" he said. \"They trumped up and really just made up facts to try to cover up what they did.\"\n\n\"This case is about what happens when the police fail to communicate and instead jump to force,\" Schwab said. \"They knew Hayden was disabled and that he posed no risk to them. But they took him to the ground and tased him instead.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Castle Rock Police Department spokesperson said the department doesn't comment on pending litigation. For days, the department wouldn't even tell CBS News Colorado the officer's employment or disciplinary status, but Schwab says the three are still employed by the department.\n\nWhile Graham has had several run-ins with the law for minor traffic violations and a 2022 guilty plea to trespassing, he has no violent criminal history.\n\nLast year, the department was sued by a man who alleged excessive force when a police K9 bit him while he was handcuffed. That case was also brought against the department by Schwab.\n\nEditorial note: The initial airing of the story reported that the officers involved were part of the Douglas County HEART team. While the Castle Rock Police Department partners with the HEART team, the department established its own homeless outreach navigator position in 2022.\n\nPaul Longuevan was serving as Castle Rock Police Department's homeless outreach navigator.

It can be republished for free.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.\n\nNow, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois, and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees, and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.\n\n“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nNordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.\n\nThe use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts, or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.\n\nCall-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.\n\n“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”\n\nEmail Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up\n\nThe White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”\n\nEmily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”\n\nWhen someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.\n\nCalifornia is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.\n\nThe Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.\n\nGordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events, and Rockies baseball games.\n\nCoombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.\n\nThe state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.\n\nNevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.\n\nKelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.\n\n“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.\n\nHannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.\n\nFederal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.\n\n“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”\n\nThis article was produced by KFF Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.", "source_domain": "kffhealthnews.org"}

We continue to see opportunities to improve the amount of funds that go to these services statewide.”\n\nPotter said the funding will be used to begin youth recovery services and expand outpatient opioid use disorder treatment. She said the initiative will also see an expansion of access to methadone, which is provided through opioid treatment programs.\n\n“We are honored to be able to manage, on behalf of Texas Health and Human Services, the contracted treatment programs for methadone throughout the State of Texas,” Potter said. “We’re particularly proud that the state has seen the work that we've done and trusts us with this important delivery model.”\n\nTPR’s journalism is free to read, but not free to produce. If you believe in independent, local journalism, help us keep it going.\n\nPotter said youth support services are critical because they limit how long opioid use disorder is a burden on an individual and put them on a path to recovery.\n\n“We’ve seen in Texas an increase in the number of individuals under the age of 18 who've been adversely impacted by opioids,” Potter said. “While not all of those individuals may have had an opioid use disorder, we want to be able to provide them with support related to their opioid use.”\n\nBe Well Texas partners with local practices to provide treatment to people with opioid use disorder across the state. Potter said this funding will allow the initiative to continue working with local partners and also leverage telehealth services to ensure rural and urban communities alike have increased access to treatment.\n\n“The most important thing is that you lean into local, community based, semi-governmental and private practice groups who can be part of the solution,” Potter said. “It’s not top-down dictates — it’s working with the local community to find a solution that makes sense.”\n\nPotter said state funding is the backbone of the services the initiative offers, especially in Texas where some people do not have access to health insurance.\n\n“We would not be able to do this work without the state support,” Potter said. “There would be a sizable number of individuals who would go without treatment, and that would increase the number of deaths in Texas related to addiction.”\n\nPotter said she hopes the work the initiative does creates less stigma associated with asking for help with substance abuse in Texas. The Be Well Initiative is also a research entity that is working to support development of new treatment options.\n\n“We hope, at the institute, to create access to even newer and better treatments, just like you would for any other disease,” Potter said. “We’re not just delivering service with treatments. We're hoping to invent, discover, and be part of providing other treatments in the future.”", "source_domain": "www.tpr.org"}

Since 2003, Jack Westfall, MD, MPH, a family medicine doctor and founder of HPRN, had convened quarterly meetings with the Community Advisory Council (C.A.C.) comprising local farmers, ranchers, teachers, students, small business owners, and retirees. Together, they built a track record of academic community partnerships and projects, beginning with colon cancer prevention in 2004 and followed by a series of initiatives that included diabetes and mental health—all driven by\n\ncommunity priorities. Dr. Westfall highlights that this prior work was key to setting the stage for IT MATTTRs. “You can’t go in and run a study like IT MATTTRs cold.”\n\nSupported participatory grant writing. Working with community members, HPRN spent six to nine months co-constructing the grant proposal, ensuring its goals aligned with community and provider priorities. Dr. Westfall notes: “We couldn’t do it without the people in the network. And they really needed our support and expertise as well.”\n\nDeveloped multi-disciplinary, multi-sector translation teams. Once funded, the HPRN engaged community members from different geographic regions, including the San Luis Valley and its local community advisory group. Together they translated OUD treatment guidelines and messages from jargon-filled medical language into locally relevant concepts and terms. They used the Boot Camp Translation process, a community-based participatory research method developed by HPRN for the explicit purpose of making complex medical terms and concepts easier and more relevant to local groups. The resulting concepts and terms were integrated into the next phase of work—translating national MAT guidelines into a training curriculum and ensuring that messages for the clinics were parallel to messages for the community. While MAT curriculum and materials were developed by an HPRN-convened group of specialists (including behavioral health, pharmacy, a physician assistant, and a primary care buprenorphine specialist), community perspectives were solicited at multiple points during the development process. “They would go through the curriculum with us and remind us: make sure there’s some piece about how this relates to the patients who are coming from Limon and Sterling and Hugo and Yuma,” recalls Dr. Westfall.\n\nLeveraged a community-driven dissemination strategy. To build awareness and demand for MAT, the C.A.C.s worked with a local graphic designer to develop locally tailored community intervention materials. The HPRN C.A.C. designed the “Have you Met MAT” communication materials; the San Luis Valley C.A.C. developed its “MAT for OUD in the SLV” communication materials. Language and concepts from the Boot Camp Translation effort informed the content. An explicit design goal was to promote conversation about treatment and reduce the stigma of addiction. Local community members distributed the resulting posters, drink coasters, and other materials to local restaurants, bars, churches, community organizations, pharmacies, and schools. Community members also designed a movie trailer for local theaters to play in advance of movies. Public radio coverage and written summary of the MAT initiative by local station KUNC in 2019 further expanded program reach.", "source_domain": "nam.edu"}

She bounced around to a few places but eventually returned home to Colorado Springs, where she overdosed on heroin in a hotel room.\n\nA family member called child welfare, which removed Miller’s twins from her care.\n\n“When they came and took my kids, I really didn’t feel anything. I was high,” Miller said. “And to be honest with you, I needed help. I needed something.\n\n“I was living in a hotel. We were doing drugs. That’s not where I was supposed to be. That’s not what I wanted. That’s not what I deserved.”\n\nWhen Miller’s children were removed from her care, she reconnected with Aspen Miracle Center in Westminster, Colo., where she had received treatment during her pregnancy. Aspen readmitted her into its program.\n\nAspen Miracle Center is an inpatient treatment facility in Westminster for Medicaid patients with around-the-clock staffing. Miller could guarantee to her El Paso County Child Protective Services social worker that a staff member would always be present to watch over her twins. She was reunited with them five days after they were removed from her care. At Aspen Miracle Center, with her twins present, she detoxed and started working toward sobriety once again.\n\n“I haven’t stopped since,” Miller said. “I’ve been working just as hard—as soon as I woke up from withdrawal or recovering from being up for however many days—I’ve just been working ever since.”\n\nMiller’s story contrasts with those of many pregnant and postpartum people in Colorado and nationwide. In Colorado, from 2016 to 2020, the second leading cause of death for pregnant and postpartum people was accidental overdose, according to a July 2023 report from the Colorado Maternal Mortality Review Committee. (The leading cause of death for this demographic during the same period was suicide.) There were 174 pregnancy-associated deaths during the four years, making Colorado’s pregnancy-associated mortality ratio 54.7 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\nNationally, the maternal mortality rate has been steadily increasing. In 2021, the rate was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\nBecause of different methodologies, it is difficult to compare the state and national rates. The maternal mortality rate in Colorado is calculated over a period that includes pregnancy and the first year after giving birth. Colorado’s data also include deaths that are both pregnancy-associated as well as pregnancy-related, which means all deaths that occur during pregnancy or within one year of the end of pregnancy are included.\n\nBy contrast, the National Center for Health Statistics only looks at deaths during pregnancy and through six weeks postpartum. It does not include deaths “from accidental or incidental causes,” which excludes deaths from causes such as accidental overdose.\n\nMaternal mortality is often considered a metric of the overall health of a community. While state and national rates cannot be easily compared, one thing is clear: the rate of maternal mortality is increasing nationwide, putting birthing people at a higher risk of death.\n\nIn Colorado and the rest of the country, people of color, people living in poverty or rural areas, those with less than a high school education or people who are older than 40 are disproportionately impacted by maternal mortality. Addressing the high mortality rates among these populations is an essential step toward achieving health equity, according to the Maternal Mortality Review Committee report.\n\nOver the last decade, in particular, Colorado hospitals, lawmakers and community organizations have worked to address the increasing maternal mortality rate due to mental and behavioral health issues, including overdose. These changes have had a positive impact, but those same changemakers point to many improvements that still need to be made.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, maternal mortality dropped rapidly across the world. The introduction of improved maternity services, safer surgical procedures and antibiotics, to name a few factors, led to better outcomes for pregnant and postpartum people.\n\nIn 1933, the ratio of deaths to live births in the U.S. was 619 per 100,000, according to The Commonwealth Fund. The number decreased through the 1960s to 37 per 100,000, then even more to about nine deaths per 100,000 in the 1990s.\n\nThen, in 1997, the trend started to move in the opposite direction in the U.S. By 2017, maternal mortality was continuing to decline worldwide except in two countries: the U.S. and the Dominican Republic, according to the World Health Organization. The 2021 ratio of deaths to live births in this country is nearing the ratio last seen more than 60 years ago.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2016, the leading causes of death for pregnant and postpartum people included infection, severe bleeding and heart conditions. In 2016, that all started to change: two of the leading causes of death are now related to mental or behavioral health, including suicide and accidental overdose related to a substance use disorder.\n\n“As an obstetric provider, it was shocking to me that it’s actually behavioral health care issues like substance use and anxiety and depression,” said Amber Johnson, a certified nurse midwife and quality improvement coach at the Colorado Perinatal Care Quality Collaborative. “For me, and I think for many clinicians, that’s kind of a pivotal point of us just realizing that it’s not the things that we were classically trained in as obstetric providers, like hemorrhage and hypertension and infection.”\n\nTraining obstetric providers is one step toward creating better outcomes for birthing patients with substance use disorders. The Maternal Overdose Matters Plus program was launched in 10 birthing hospitals earlier this year. The program aids hospitals in providing equitable access to treatment and recovery for patients with substance use disorders, as well as offers birthing hospitals free naloxone, a life-saving overdose medication, to dispense to families where the pregnant person or someone else in the household is at risk of opioid overdose.\n\nThe initiative allows providers to start medication-assisted treatment (such as the use of buprenorphine or methadone to treat opioid use disorder) while pregnant patients are at the hospital for delivery or another reason. This moves away from the older model of providing patients with a list of self-guided resources and takes advantage of critical windows of care to get patients on a treatment plan.\n\nFor Miller, an earlier intervention might have changed the trajectory of her addiction well before she gave birth to her twins. She started using methamphetamine in 2009 when she was 22 years old. She was already the mother of two young boys—the first she had when she was 16 and living in a group home, and the second when she was 19. Today, both boys live with their fathers.\n\nMiller’s mom struggled with substance abuse when she was growing up. Her interest in trying meth for the first time was related to her mother’s use of it.\n\n“I just wanted to know more about it. I was so curious as to why my mom chose that over me,” she said.\n\nMiller continued to raise her first two children while her meth use persisted.\n\n“I still picked up my kids from school. I was part of the PTO. I would use it more like a tool,” she said. “That doesn’t mean that I also didn’t spend a lot of time in the bathroom—I spent a lot of time in the bathroom. My kids may have been neglected, not sure, but I was still there, and they were there.”\n\nShe got married and pregnant again with her third son when she was 25. (The twins are her fourth and fifth sons.) She managed to stay sober during her pregnancy but relapsed soon after giving birth. Something flipped for her. She called it a quarter-life crisis.\n\n“I started thinking, why did that happen with my parents? Why was I in the system? Why did my mom do drugs? Why was my dad violent?” Miller wondered.\n\n“I was shattered. I was a fractured person. Looking back now, I was probably coping with these things with the tools that I had at my disposal.”\n\nShe left her partner when her third son was about eight months old.\n\n“My life spiraled. I was living with this boyfriend. I was running away from him all the time because he was controlling everybody around him with heroin. … I would always have to go back because he was a heroin drug dealer, so he always had it,” Miller said. “When I got on heroin, that’s when I had nothing.” While using meth, she said, “I was still scheduled, still had my kids—but heroin, before I knew it, five years was gone. It was crazy.”\n\nA stint in jail for possession and theft landed her in court-mandated treatment, which she said was necessary because she learned a lot and started to understand her addiction better. However, she had to leave the treatment center after attempting suicide; the center said it didn’t have suitable mental health treatment options for her.\n\nShe managed to stay sober for more than a year. Then, she became pregnant with her twins. She relapsed after finding out, and about halfway through her pregnancy, she found Aspen Miracle Center.\n\nDuring the time Miller was using, then getting clean and then relapsing, overdose deaths in Colorado and the U.S. were steadily climbing. Between 2019 and 2021, overdose deaths increased by more than 70%, according to state and federal data, and Colorado’s overdose deaths outpaced the national average.\n\nFor Miller, who now lives and works in Denver, where she has custody of her twins, the difference has been her time at the Aspen Miracle Center. She met people she could relate to and rely on and who understood what she was going through. She learned the skills she needed to choose her children over her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and other people in her life who use substances. Miller said she also started figuring out how to break the generational cycle she was born into.\n\n“I grew up with my dad,” she said. “My mom was on substances. My children grew up with their dads, and I did substances. So I followed out that generational pattern, and I get to choose to do something different with my younger kids today.”", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org"}

Company officials say another $2 billion and three years will extend service to Orlando International Airport.\n\nWes Edens, co-founder, principal and co-chief executive officer of Brightline owner Fortress Investment Group, says that his firm has a vision “well beyond the state of Florida” for corridors that share the same characteristics of the cities Brightline connects in Florida -- “too far to drive, too short to fly.”\n\nBrightline president and chief operating officer Patrick Goddard, in an interview with Florida Trend, made clear that Brightline hopes to be the one to implement privately owned intercity service in new corridors nationally to address the nation’s traffic congestion problems. Such service disappeared in America in the last century. “We absolutely think that we now have the blueprint, we’ve got the playbook,” Goddard said. “This is the proof of concept that we can actually get this done with private capital.”\n\nGoddard said adding service in new regions would require working through a host of issues. In southeast Florida and up the coast through Brevard, Brightline had the advantage of developing private rail service on a rail line owned by a corporate sibling. “These are not uncomplicated things to figure out,” Goddard said, but, “we got it done here and we got it done in a very compressed time period. We believe we’ve got the playbook to do it again.”\n\nDallas-Houston is the “most obvious” place for private passenger service, he said, but he also cited Charlotte-Atlanta and Chicago-St. Louis. “There are others that we’re evaluating,” Goddard said.\n\nA question mark around Brightline has been whether the service will prove commercially viable. To date, Brightline hasn’t revealed ridership numbers for its West Palm Beach-Fort Lauderdale leg, which has been open since January, but company officials have said they’re pleased with the response to the service. A desire to expand to new corridors provides an indication the service will work financially.\n\n“This is a model that is commercially viable,” Edens says.", "source_domain": "www.floridatrend.com"}

POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nAs fentanyl overdoses continue to soar in Colorado, a new medication assisted treatment facility in Aurora is hoping to lower barriers to treatment for people struggling with opioid addiction.\n\nCommunity Medical Services opened its intake facility in Aurora Oct. 28, and is the city’s first opioid outpatient center. It will offer medication assisted treatment and counseling, 15 hours a day, seven days a week to people seeking help for addiction.\n\nBased in Arizona, CMS has over 50 facilities in 10 states. This is its first location in Colorado, but it hopes to open about half a dozen more over the next several years, program manager Christina Boudreaux told The Sentinel. The company was drawn to Colorado due to what she described as an overwhelming need for more addiction services.\n\n“When we were looking at the overdose rates, Colorado is so incredibly underserved, and so when we saw the opportunity to make an impact we jumped on it,” she said.\n\nAccording to data compiled by the clinic using 2020 numbers, Boudreaux said that in Colorado four people die every day from an opioid overdose death, a rate that she believes is an undercount from the current situation.\n\nSimilar to states across the country, Colorado has been grappling for years with a rise in overdose deaths. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported that 1,881 people died from a drug overdose in 2021, and the age-adjusted rate of fatal overdoses was 31.7 per 100,000 residents, up from 1,477 deaths and a rate of 24.9 the previous year.\n\nOutreach Lead, Patrick Sullivan, reflects back on how Community Medical Services was able to help him get past his heroin addiction, Oct. 26, at the new CMS facility in Aurora.\n\nPhoto by PHILIP B. POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nFentanyl, an ultra-powerful synthetic opioid, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, has been driving many of the deaths, according to state and federal health officials.\n\nThe federal government counted more accidental overdose deaths in 2021 alone than it did in the 20-year period from 1979 through 1998. Overdoses in recent years have been many times more frequent than they were during the black tar heroin epidemic that led President Richard Nixon to launch his War on Drugs, or during the cocaine crisis in the 1980s.\n\nAs fentanyl gains attention, mistaken beliefs persist about the drug, how it is trafficked and why so many people are dying.\n\nExperts believe deaths surged not only because the drugs are so powerful, but also because fentanyl is laced into so many other illicit drugs, and not because of changes in how many people are using. In the late 2010s — the most recent period for which federal data is available — deaths were skyrocketing even as the number of people using opioids was dropping.\n\nAdvocates warn that some of the alarms being sounded by politicians and officials are wrong and potentially dangerous. Among those ideas: that tightening control of the U.S.-Mexico border would stop the flow of the drugs, though experts say the key to reining in the crisis is reducing drug demand; that fentanyl might turn up in kids’ trick-or-treat baskets this Halloween; and that merely touching the drug briefly can be fatal — something that researchers found untrue and that advocates worry can make first responders hesitate about giving lifesaving treatment.\n\nAll three ideas were brought up this month in an online video billed as a pre-Halloween public service announcement from a dozen Republican U.S. senators.\n\nA report this year from a bipartisan federal commission found that fentanyl and similar drugs are being made mostly in labs in Mexico from chemicals shipped primarily from China.\n\nWith such a deadly drug flooding the streets, providers at CMS say their mission is more important than ever.\n\nMedication assisted treatment, commonly abbreviated as MAT, involves treating people addicted to opioids with a substance that inhibits their ability to get high off of opioids and that decreases their craving for the drug. The clinic offers both methadone and suboxone, which must be taken every day in liquid form, as well as vivitrol, an injectable drug administered every 28 days.\n\nLocated at 14300 E. Exposition Ave., a short walk from the Aurora Metro Center Station and the Town Center of Aurora, the new facility is specifically designed to be as accessible as possible. It is open from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, operates on a walk-in basis and has a goal of having wait times of no longer than five minutes.\n\nThat makes it unique for MAT facilities, which often are only open in the early morning until around noon and don’t process people for initial intake appointments every day, Boudreaux said. With a medicine that needs to be taken every day to be effective, that can make things difficult for patients, many of whom don’t have their own cars or work irregular hours.\n\n“The thought is, the second someone’s ready for treatment, they can come in,” she said. There are eight rooms at the new Community Medical Services location in Aurora.\n\nPhoto by PHILIP B. POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nUnlike some other programs, the clinic is also unique in that it will not stop treating patients if they continue to test positive for drugs, and will only kick patients out if they are aggressive or violent. From a public health perspective, Boudreaux said it doesn’t make sense to cut off people’s access to treatment when they are struggling.\n\n“There’s no treatment if they die,” she said.\n\nThe clinic currently has 13 staff members, and the methadone and suboxone, which are highly regulated, will be administered by licensed nurses at several window kiosks. Past the kiosks are a series of rooms that will be used for one-on-one counseling sessions for patients.\n\nThe rooms are brightly decorated, and the reception area has floor-to-ceiling windows. Michele Ryan, community programs and integrations manager for CMS, said the clinic was designed to look as much like a normal doctor’s office as possible. A big part of CMS’ mission is to reduce the stigma associated with receiving treatment for addiction.\n\n“Our clients are so judged in the rest of the world, when they come here we want that to be a respite from that,” she said.\n\nNoise machines are placed outside of each of the eight therapy rooms that are located at the new Community Medical Services facility in Aurora. The sound machines are there to ensure privacy when meeting with a counselor.\n\nPhoto by PHILIP B. POSTON/Sentinel Colorado\n\nThe counselors will also provide case management services for patients, and will try to connect them with other services they need to try and deal with their addiction.\n\n“We always try to have an answer to any barrier someone has,” said Patrick Sullivan, CMS’ outreach lead for the new clinic.\n\nSullivan is no stranger to the efficacy of MAT. In college in the late 1990s he started using heroin and illicit prescription opioids and ultimately became an everyday user dependent on the drug to function and not become sick.\n\n“My normal was I had to have the drugs in my system,” he said.\n\nHe ultimately decided that he needed help, but was living in a rural part of Illinois where resources were scarce. He ended up moving to Tucson and started receiving treatment at a CMS clinic. It took about two months on methadone before he stopped using opioids, he said, but he ultimately quit completely and has been clean ever since.\n\nBeing on treatment that took away his craving for the drug and allowed him to focus on changing other conditions of his life instead of being trapped in a cycle of constantly trying to make enough money to get high so he didn’t become dopesick.\n\nHe was on methadone for a total of three years. After about two years he decided he wanted to start planning to quit, and worked with a doctor to taper off the medication over the course of 10 months.\n\n“I wouldn’t have the life I have without it,” he said of the treatment.\n\nSullivan has now worked with CMS for five and a half years, and said his personal experience with addiction and recovery has been a benefit when working with patients and potential community partners. The company does a lot of outreach to local jails and hospital systems to try to streamline access to treatment for addicts, and he said being able to address people’s questions or concerns about MAT with firsthand knowledge is reassuring.\n\nOver time he said he’s seen an increase in the acceptance of MAT, which was initially met with trepidation from some corners due. He worked for a number of years with patients who were in the criminal justice system, and said that the willingness of sheriffs and judges to allow people to receive MAT has increased over time.\n\n“I would talk to police officers who started telling me, ‘we can’t arrest our way out of this problem,’ and they’re out there on the front lines arresting people,” he said.\n\nThis undated file photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Los Angeles Field Division, shows some of the seized approximately 1 million fake pills containing fentanyl that were seized when agents served a search warrant, July 5, 2022, at a home in Inglewood, Calif.

(Drug Enforcement Administration via AP, File)\n\nThat sentiment was repeated at a community event organized by Aurora Public Schools over the weekend, where local law enforcement and public health officials raised the red flag about the dangers of fentanyl.\n\nProsecutors in the 17th and 18th Judicial Districts, which encompass Adams and Arapahoe counties, said that fentanyl has completely infected the local drug supply. Fentanyl is easier to manufacture than other drugs and is highly addictive, which incentivizes drug dealers to add it to their supply.\n\n“No drug is safe right now,” said 17th Judicial District Attorney Brian Mason. “Do not take any pill unless you know where it’s from and it came from a pharmacy.”\n\nThe department has found fentanyl in everything from meth and heroin to cocaine, he said. Darcy Kofol, who prosecutes drug crimes in the 18th Judicial District, said that fentanyl has completely replaced the supply of illicit oxycodone that used to be on the streets.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has warned that fentanyl is being sold in multicolored pills and powders — sometimes referred to as “rainbow fentanyl” — marketed on social media to teens and young adults. However, experts say fears of fentanyl being marketed to young children are unfounded.\n\nJoel Best, an emeritus sociology professor at the University of Delaware, said that idea falls in with a long line of Halloween-related scares. He has examined cases since 1958 and has not found a single instance of a child dying because of something foreign put into Halloween candy — and few instances of that being done at all.\n\n“If you give a dose of fentanyl to kids in elementary school, you have an excellent chance of killing them,” he said. “If you do addict them, what are you going to do, try to take their lunch money? No one is trying to addict little kids to fentanyl.”\n\n(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nMany times, people overdose because they take a pill that they think is an opioid or another prescription drug but is actually fentanyl, Kofol said. Without people knowing exactly what substances they’re ingesting, it’s incredibly easy to take a fatal dose by accident.\n\n“Each of these pills are essentially Russian roulette with an overdose,” she said.\n\nKofol referenced a 2020 case where a 16-year-old girl died of an overdose after being given fentanyl by an adult man at a party. Kofol said the girl thought she was taking an oxycodone pill. The man was sentenced to 64 years in prison this summer.\n\n“Teens are allowed to make mistakes,” she said. “The problem with fentanyl is it doesn’t care.”\n\nAt the Aurora Public Schools event, employees from the Tri-County Health Department handed out narcan, a drug that can be used to safely reverse opioid overdoses, as well as fentanyl testing strips that can be used to determine whether fentanyl is present in another substance.\n\nThe best thing people can do to help prevent overdose deaths is to be aware of the dangers of fentanyl and to talk to their children and friends about it, Mason said. He feels better when people who sell deadly drugs are put behind bars, but said that by itself incarceration won’t be enough to solve the problem — and it can’t bring someone back to life who has already died of an overdose.\n\n“Prevention is better than prosecution,” he said.\n\n— The Associated Press contributed to this report", "source_domain": "sentinelcolorado.com"}

Phil Henning of Sacred Heart Catholic Church denied Kevin his first reception of the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, Henning said the boy had \"the mental capacity of a 6-month old\" and didn't have \"sufficient knowledge of Christ\" to participate in the religious rite, even though Catholic doctrine doesn't specify what level of knowledge is adequate.\n\nKevin's grandmother, Irma Castro, said Kevin had prepared for months for the \"religious milestone\" only to be offered a ritual for those who are sick.\n\n\"That is the anointing they give you before death,\" his grandmother told ABC's affiliate KSAT. \"That was very offensive.\"\n\nKevin's family cried \"discrimination.\"\n\nCerebral palsy can include any number of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination but don't worsen over time, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIt is the most common motor disorder in children and is second only to autism as the most common disability in children, according to United Cerebral Palsy, an organization that provides education and support for people with a spectrum of disabilities. Each year about 10,000 babies born in the United States will develop cerebral palsy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It affects boys more frequently than girls.\n\nCerebral palsy, though, is not always associated with intellectual disability. \"It's not the same as intellectual disability, and it does not cause intellectual disability,\" said Chris Thomson, general counsel for UCP. \"Individuals who have cerebral palsy can also have intellectual disability. But one does not cause the other and they are separate conditions.\"\n\nIt can, however, come with its share of misunderstanding and discrimination, like the kind Kevin Castro experienced in his church.\n\n\"Faith is an important part of people's lives, and we hope that his church and family can find a solution that allows Kevin to be an active and full participant of his faith community,\" said Stephen Bennett, president and CEO of UCP. \"UCP is committed to full citizenship for people with disabilities, regardless of the severity and expression.\"\n\n\"Without knowing [Kevin's] medical diagnosis, it is impossible to know what he may be experiencing,\" said Thomson. \"But people often mistakenly confuse cerebral palsy for an intellectual disability because of the symptoms they witness, such a slurred speech, drooling or spasticity.\"\n\nIrma Castro said that she had been helping to prepare Kevin for months for his communion, and the priest's decision had shaken her faith. \"I hurt for my grandson and my family,\" she said.\n\nFirst Communion Is Important Rite\n\nThe important ceremony means the child has been embraced by the church community. and it is accompanied by traditional family celebrations and gifts.\n\nDeacon Pat Rodgers, from the Archdiocese of San Antonio, told ABCNews.com that the decision whether to give the sacrament lies with the local priest, but emphasized, \"It's never our desire, hope or wish to withhold a sacrament from someone who wants or needs it.\"\n\nHenning's church offices were closed Tuesday, and he did not return messages left by ABCNews.com.", "source_domain": "abcnews.go.com"}

Unmotivated, increasingly cynical, or detached from coworkers? If so, you may be on the road to burnout.\n\nYes, burnout is real and is now a legitimate medical diagnosis according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) handbook, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), that guides medical providers in diagnosing diseases.\n\nDr. Frank Drummond, chief medical officer of behavioral health services at HCA Healthcare, explained that burnout has been since 2003 classified as a symptom – a problem related to life management – but was recently updated as a syndrome.\n\nWHO has now re-labeled the designation from a “state” of exhaustion to a “syndrome” resulting from “chronic workplace stress.”\n\nAppearing in the new version of the ICD-11, which will go into effect in January 2022, the official definition of burnout states:\n\n“Burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic\n\nworkplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is\n\ncharacterized by three dimensions: 1) feelings of energy depletion\n\nor exhaustion; 2) increased mental distance from one’s job, or\n\nfeelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and 3) reduced\n\nprofessional efficacy.”\n\nThe Genesis of Burnout\n\nIn 1974, psychologist Herbert Freudenberger became the first to coin ‘burnout’ in a medical journal, after studying the lasting impact of excessive stress and workplace demands on individuals, resulting in symptoms like depression.\n\nIn other words, burnout isn’t a new phenomenon, nor does it appear overnight. A recent Gallup poll found that “23% of employees reported feeling burned out at work very often or always, while an additional 44% reported feeling burned out sometimes.”\n\n“The fact that burnout is an ‘official’ diagnosis will hopefully translate to greater education and awareness around quality of life for those in the workforce,” said Dr. Drummond. “And, for professionals working in behavioral health, and others in the medical community, we hope this new designation and conversation around burnout will encourage people to seek treatment and reach out for help.”\n\nDr. Drummond and Cordett McCall, a licensed mental health counselor and clinical manager of behavioral health at HCA Healthcare affiliate Largo Medical Center, tag team to help us dive deeper into this “occupational phenomenon” and provide tools to deal with burnout before hitting rock bottom.\n\nCordett McCall serves as a licensed counselor and certified addiction specialist in the HCA Healthcare West Florida Division.\n\nWhat is the difference between stress and burnout?\n\nEveryone deals with stress at some point in their lives. It’s a normal physical and psychological response to sudden dangers and long-lasting challenges, Dr. Drummond said in the HCA Healthcare Today article “Stress, the health epidemic of the 21st century.”\n\nBurnout, on the other hand, is the result of unrelenting stress. People experiencing burnout often feel mentally exhausted, disconnected, unproductive – doesn’t care about one’s work – and inefficient at tasks, Dr. Drummond explained.\n\nWhen does burnout occur?\n\nBurnout happens when passion is replaced by repetition, quality with quantity, and empathy with hopelessness, says McCall. When that desire to do the thing a person most loves professionally becomes a daunting task and they no longer find it rewarding, that’s a sign of burnout.\n\nHow can a medical professional diagnose someone with burnout?\n\nSymptoms that manifest clearly in employees who are burned out include:\n\nemotional exhaustion\n\npessimism or negativity towards everything, particularly at work,\n\nlack of empathy\n\ndetachment from co-workers\n\npowerlessness or feeling as if nothing you do makes a difference; being “checked out”\n\na perception of being worse at your job than you were before\n\nThese are especially easy to detect when these behaviors are not characteristic of how the employees used to behave or present, says McCall.\n\nDr. Drummond also noted other symptoms that are physical in nature including, recurrent illnesses, such as colds or a lowered immune system, frequent headaches or muscle pains, and changes in appetite.\n\nWhat are the causes of burnout?\n\nMcCall explained that knowing limitations are important. Attempting to meet everyone’s demands all the time is unrealistic and can lead to burnout. Examples that could cause burnout include:\n\nsaying “yes” to everyone\n\nsacrificing personal time, breaks or even taking a lunch\n\nshifting personal priorities to meet work demands (work-life imbalance)\n\ninability to have stress relief as part of everyday life\n\nExcessive levels of stress can also lead to burnout, Dr. Drummond added, as well as undefined job descriptions and feelings of inadequacy or an ability to perform at a level that one is accustomed to.\n\nAccording to this CNBC article, unfair treatment at work, unreasonable deadlines, unmanageable workload and lack of support from managers also cause burnout. The writer also added that the stress that comes with 24/7 access to work, through emails and texts, and expectations to respond at off-hours compounds burnout.\n\nConsequences of job burnout?\n\nBurnout can produce a myriad of consequences. Depression, anxiety, decreased immune system from stress which leads to more sick days, impaired judgment (burnout individuals just don’t care), which can cause critical errors at work, sleep disturbances, decreased efficacy…the list goes on.\n\nIs burnout limited to professional work?\n\nAnytime someone has a passion for something, coupled with a loss of control to express that passion independently, burnout is inevitable, says McCall. Other contributing burnout factors include expectations to produce repetitious results, receiving minimal recognition and a focus on quantity versus quality. Stay-at-home moms, religious leaders or volunteers can be susceptible to burnout if these variables are present.\n\nRisk factors?\n\nAn individual might be more likely to experience burnout if they:\n\ndon’t work well under pressure\n\nstruggle with anxiety, depression\n\nhave a perfectionist viewpoint\n\nWork life balance is important to managing burnout.\n\nHow to manage burnout?\n\nThere are so many things that can be done to manage burnout but first, the individual has to be aware that it can happen to them.\n\nMcCall suggests individuals start to cope by:\n\ngetting a hobby or exercising\n\ntalking to a therapist\n\ndeveloping a support network\n\nsetting up self-care and life goals\n\nmaintaining balance\n\nPeople can also deal with the road to burnout, according to Dr. Drummond, by:\n\nreevaluating their life or career choices and looking at the things that are causing burnout\n\nimproving the amount of interpersonal or personally gratifying activities they’re involved in to balance the amount of time spent at work\n\ntaking time off of work\n\n“It can be difficult to differentiate everyday stress to a full point of burnout,” Dr. Drummond noted. “But if you’re feeling stressed and out of balance, don’t wait. It’s still useful to reach out for help either through a therapist or through your company’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP).”\n\nMcCall hopes this new classification and conversation will allow people to identify burnout, help prevent it for others, and provide resources to recover from this emotionally draining experience called burnout.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}
{"url": "https://reason.org/testimony/texas-senate-bill-2308-could-advance-ibogaine-as-a-treatment-for-opioid-use-disorder/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "A version of the following public comment was submitted to the Texas Senate Committee on Health and Human Services on April 23, 2025.\n\nWe believe that studying ibogaine would be beneficial for mental health and addiction care. If ibogaine demonstrates both safety and efficacy, it could facilitate treatment access to millions of Americans suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD) and other mental health conditions. We believe that Senate Bill 2308 provides a sensible regulatory pathway for the advancement of ibogaine as a potential treatment for OUD, co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD), and other relevant neurological or mental health conditions.\n\nTexas can lead the nation in innovative mental health and addiction care solutions with this bill. Senate Bill 2308 prioritizes patient safety and scientific rigor. There are strict requirements for all applicants wishing to conduct trials. To be eligible for the grant, applicants must be private corporation entities with enough capacity and financial resources to conduct FDA trials, seek FDA approval, and conduct future trials. Applicants must also provide detailed plans on trial design, participant recruitment, safety protocols, post-treatment aftercare, and strategy for FDA-approval.\n\nSenate Bill 2308 does not attempt to legalize ibogaine or ibogaine treatment, nor does it try to bypass existing federal regulations. It would retain current prohibitions on possession, use, manufacture, and sale of psychedelic compounds, as well as provide a framework consistent with the FDA drug-approval process, as ibogaine treatment administration will only apply if FDA approval is granted, requiring licensed physicians to supervise its administration in healthcare facilities.\n\nOver the past decade, the medical community has increasingly recognized the potential of psychedelic therapies for the treatment of mental health conditions and addiction. However, despite promising research, access to innovative psychedelic therapies is limited by the FDA’s designation of psychedelics as Schedule I substances. Ibogaine appears to have a unique ability to rapidly reduce withdrawal and craving symptoms associated with opioid addiction, often after just a single dose.\n\nThe grant program under SB 3208 offers an opportunity to collect comprehensive safety and efficacy data on ibogaine for treating OUD, SUD, and other mental health disorders, while ensuring alignment with existing federal regulations and FDA drug approval standards.\n\nWhile not necessarily a major point of concern, we’d like to note that Senate Bill 3208 contains slightly different language regarding funding sources than its companion bill, House Bill 3717. The House Bill allows for funding from both appropriated money and gifts, grants, or donations, while the Senate Bill only allows for funding from gifts, grants, or donations. The House language may provide additional flexibility for the funding of ibogaine studies, potentially allowing for the use of resources such as opioid settlement funds. This broader funding approach could enhance the program’s impact and success.\n\nOverall, SB 3208 would allow Texas to administer grants to conduct potentially life-saving research into ibogaine, which has shown tremendous promise in the therapeutic treatment of OUD, with minimal risk to both public safety and public health.

In honor of the Hacketts, MMHPI will establish The Hackett Center for Mental Health in Houston, a permanent operating program of MMHPI with an initial primary focus on Hurricane Harvey recovery.\n\n“This extraordinary gift will allow us to establish a lasting presence in Houston focused on translating policy into practice in partnership with the region’s leading health systems,” said Dr. Andy Keller, President and CEO of MMHPI. “The Hackett Center for Mental Health will be a catalyst for advancements by better aligning public and private sector policies to improve mental health care delivery – expanding brain health research, strengthening academic-public-private partnerships and improving the quality and availability of care in one of our nation’s largest metropolitan areas.”\n\nThe Hackett Center for Mental Health is based on the premise that health system transformation requires a continuous focus on local system collaboration and capacity enhancement, sustained by system-level policy reforms. The center will engage local and state leaders to improve the region’s institutional capacity for mental health policy and program research and technical assistance to implement state-of-the-art best practices. The new center will maintain the Institute’s progress at a state and regional level for children, veterans and adults in the criminal justice system, and will continue to place an emphasis on the necessary synergy between state policy and local system transformation needed to achieve better outcomes.\n\nGiven its focus as serving as a catalyst for improving mental health care across the region’s health systems, The Hackett Center for Mental Health will locate in the Texas Medical Center and will be an active partner in the vision of collaboration and innovation at the heart of TMC3.\n\nThe Institute is also proud to announce that Susan Fordice will serve as executive director of The Hackett Center for Mental Health. She previously served as President and CEO of Mental Health America of Greater Houston, and brings decades of service to the community in many of the region’s leading health and academic institutions, as well as an unparalleled knowledge of the mental health landscape in Houston and the region.\n\nMaureen Hackett said her family believes in the mission and the expertise of the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.\n\n“Our family is dedicated to serving the interests that make up the heart of every strong community: faith, family, health and education. Mental health care is a cause so dear to my family, the community, this great state and the entire nation,” said Maureen Hackett. “This gift is an investment in quality, research-driven work that will prove to be a systemic game-changer.”\n\n“The Hackett family has long held a vision of Houston as a home for world-renowned brain health research and innovation, as well as a model of effective access to mental health care,” said Jim Hackett. “Through this gift, we can put policies into practice to help realize that dream.”\n\nThree in four Texans have a friend or family member who has experienced a mental health issue, and an estimated 310,000 children and youth in Harris County have mental health needs each year.\n\n“Mental health, just like physical health, affects the lives of all Texans,” said Tom Luce, board member and founding CEO of MMHPI. “The Hacketts’ generous philanthropy and profound dedication to expanding access to mental health care will have a sustained, positive impact for generations of future Texans.”\n\n“The Hackett family has put Houston on the national stage in addressing how mental health services are delivered,” said Lyndon Olson, MMHPI Board Chair. “Behavioral health is one of the most significant medical, public policy, and perception challenges of our time, and this gift positions The Hackett Center to be a driving force in creating the path forward.”\n\nThe Hacketts are passionate agents of change in the realm of behavioral and mental health. Maureen Hackett has served in local, state and national leadership roles in mental health for over 30 years. She is a founding board member of the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute and serves on the advisory boards of the Texas Medical Center, the Behavioral and Developmental Collaborative at Texas Children’s Hospital and The Mental Health Channel. She is also a member of the Executive Committee of the MD Anderson Cancer Center Board of Visitors, a director of the American Psychiatric Association Foundation, and an Honorary Lifetime Board Member of Mental Health America of Greater Houston. She is past chair of The Menninger Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nJim Hackett is the former Executive Chairman of the Board and former CEO of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. He is currently a Partner in Riverstone Holdings and CEO of Silver Run II, an energy investment fund. He cares passionately about mental health parity and has testified before the U.S. Congress about the need for mental health coverage by employers. He previously led efforts to encourage other Houston business leaders to review their insurance coverage regarding mental health care.\n\nA major early focus of the center will be addressing the myriad of mental health needs left in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. “Hurricanes and other natural disasters can have long-term harmful effects on the mental health of children, youth and adults,” said Dr. Keller. “The Hackett Center for Mental Health will work with existing agencies and organizations to more efficiently and effectively build capacity and provide care to heal the emotional wounds left by this storm.”\n\nAbout MMHPI\n\nSince its public launch in 2014, MMHPI has helped Texas legislators, state officials, members of the judiciary, and local leaders identify systemic mental health needs and solutions, quickly becoming Texas’s most trusted source for data-driven mental health policy. In three short years, the Institute has begun to make significant impact in multiple areas, helping Texas leaders expand the mental health workforce, improve access to care for veterans and their families, shift the focus of new investments toward early intervention, and address the mental health crisis in our jails and emergency rooms.\n\nConnect with us on Twitter @TXMind and on Facebook at TXMind.\n\n# # #\n\nAttachments:\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/98ab2efc-a2d6-4665-aee6-a526e4f86e87\n\nAttachments:\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/68242353-080c-4c2c-848b-89aada273fff\n\nAttachments:\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b8b48d2e-f617-4314-8762-b279e0c9a903", "source_domain": "www.globenewswire.com"}

The pills that killed her were smuggled into the jail inside another woman's body.\n\nAlizon Lopez was found unresponsive in her cell at 2:30 p.m. on May 21, 2022 by her cellmate, shortly after she had finished her work shift in the jail's laundry. Jail deputies and nursing staff immediately began CPR and called for an ambulance. But Lopez never recovered.\n\nMonths later, the Mesa County Coroner's Office concluded Lopez died of fentanyl intoxication. It called her death an accident.\n\nAlizon Lopez in a 2016 photo, six years before she was arrested in Mesa County. Lopez family\n\nThe 28-year-old Grand Junction woman, a mother of four, had been incarcerated in Mesa County's jail on drug-related charges.\n\nBy that December, federal prosecutors in Denver, with the help of a Grand Junction grand jury, declared five people - a longtime drug dealer in Arizona, three Colorado residents who bought the fentanyl pills from him, and one inmate through whom the drug reached Lopez - were responsible for Lopez's passing.\n\nAll five are now serving federal prison terms.\n\nJeremiah Robinson following his arrest in 2019.

Robinson, a 44-year-old Phoenix resident and six-time convicted felon, was known on his CashApp handle as \"$jackjames1996,\" according to a case document. He sold out of an older white van with chipped paint.\n\nHe met Efrain Velez, as he had several times before, in a Phoenix park on May 7, 2022. Velez, a 36-year-old from Denver, purchased hundreds of blue pills. The pills were stamped with an \"M\" on one side and a \"30\" on the other, resembling Oxycodone pills manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc., per investigators.\n\nEfrain Velez following his arrest in May 2022.

Whether Velez knew the pills contained fentanyl is not a detail contained in the case documents.\n\nThis day, Velez was accompanied by Vanessa Vasquez, 40, of Denver, his girlfriend. Another woman whom the pair had recently befriended and agreed to include in the drug dealing was also with them: Anna Munday, 30, of Clifton.\n\nVanessa Vasquez (left) and Anna Munday following their arrests in May 2022.

As they were stopping, both Velez and Vasquez inserted hundreds of fentanyl pills inside themselves. Other drugs remained in the car, and the trio was taken into custody.\n\nVelez was not successful in hiding his stash. According to his plea agreement, several pills fell from his pants leg during a police interview. Later that day, he received emergency medical treatment for the unknown number of pills that remained in his body.\n\nVasquez, though, kept her secret. She and Munday were booked into the Mesa County Detention Center.

Lopez reportedly consumed half her share before her laundry shift and finished the rest when she returned from it, according to case documents.\n\nFor selling the drugs to the Coloradans, Robinson was sentenced a year ago to 19 years and seven months in prison. He is currently housed at the Federal Corrections Institute in south Denver (FCI Englewood).\n\nVelez was sentenced last week to 15 years.

Read on to find out how our scale and skill allows us to harness the power of data to improve more lives across the United States…\n\nThe numbers are staggering. Every day, on average, 130 Americans die from opioid overdose. In 2017, an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers. To reverse the trajectory of this epidemic, leveraging data collected from more than 31 million annual patient encounters, HCA Healthcare healthcare has:\n\nDeveloped cutting-edge pain treatment protocols\n\nPromoted enhanced surgical recovery programs\n\nLaunched national “Crush the Crisis” opioid take back events\n\nDeployed prescription monitoring and reporting programs\n\nLeveraging prescribing data\n\nDr. Christopher Ott, chief medical officer at HCA Healthcare’s Physician Services Group (PSG)\n\n“HCA Healthcare has made tremendous advances in how we use data collected from our network of hospitals and clinics to improve patient care,” said Dr. Christopher Ott, chief medical officer at HCA Healthcare’s Physician Services Group (PSG).\n\nHCA Healthcare has employed our internally developed data, reporting and vendor information technology (IT) platforms to aid us in these efforts. In 2014, a multidisciplinary team began extracting prescribing data from the company’s electronic data warehouse (EDW) and ambulatory electronic health record (EHR) system to report on location, patient and provider specific prescribing data.\n\nDr. Carol White, director of pharmacy services and clinical therapeutics at HCA Healthcare\n\nDr. Carol White, director of pharmacy services and clinical therapeutics at HCA Healthcare, helped lead the initiative.\n\n“It was a major undertaking,” Dr. White said. “We had to create an entire medication-specific reporting architecture within our enterprise data warehouse to house the data, develop algorithms for certain medications and calculations, and establish workflows for providers that streamlined their work, while capturing the data in a way that allowed us to utilize it more efficiently.”\n\nUsing HCA Healthcare’s in-house analytics, the team created a reporting dashboard to examine prescribing patterns across the organization. All of this aimed at improving the way opioids are prescribed and how data is shared with providers.\n\n“This kind of deep insight creates opportunities to empower the provider with their own data,” Dr. White said. “Real trends began emerging in less than one year,” she added.\n\nElectronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances (EPCS)\n\nThe team implemented the dashboard in tandem with the launch of Electronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances (EPCS), which allows providers to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions to a pharmacy. EPCS provides accountability, security, and has been shown to dramatically reduce medication errors and fraud.\n\nPartnering with the National Academy of Medicine (NAM)\n\nHCA Healthcare also established new processes and standardized safeguards to protect providers, patients and communities. In July 2018, HCA Healthcare joined the National Academy of Medicine’s Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic and provided $500,000 to help bolster the fight against the crisis.\n\nUsing data to develop new strategies for pain management\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR)\n\nHCA Healthcare developed new strategies to manage pain for the 1.5 million patients that have surgery annually in an HCA Healthcare facility. HCA Healthcare’s Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR) is an innovative surgical approach that uses evidence-based pre, intra, and post-operative interventions to optimize patient outcomes.\n\nESR, which features a multi-modal approach to pain management for patients, has demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and – importantly – a drastic reduction in the use for opioids.\n\nHCA Healthcare data from January 2018 through June 2019, collected from 47,400 major abdominal, joint, gynecologic oncology, spinal and bariatric ESR surgeries revealed an up to 50.4% decrease in opioid use for these patients. The data, collected from 114 affiliate hospitals, was compared to a non-ESR protocol patient population undergoing the same surgery procedures in the same time period.\n\nThe goal is to implement ESR in all HCA Healthcare facilities, in a least one major service line, by the end of 2019.\n\nALTernatives to Opioids in the Emergency Room (ALTO in the ER)\n\nWith ALTO in the ER, HCA Healthcare’s goal is to manage painful conditions for emergency department patients and return them to a maximum quality of life, while recognizing and reducing the inherent risks of administering and prescribing highly addictive medications like opioids.\n\nIn 2017, affiliate Swedish Medical Center pioneered the first-of-its-kind strategy to curtail potential opioid misuse related to the use of opioids in the emergency department. With the ALTO in the ER program, rather than using opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone or fentanyl, medications like ketamine and lidocaine are employed for frontline pain management.\n\nBecause of this emergency department initiative, patient opioid use at affiliate Swedish Medical Center from June – November of 2017 was reduced by 36%, compared to data from a non-ALTO patient population over the same time period in 2016.\n\nHCA Healthcare plans to continue to expand the ALTO in the ER protocols enterprise-wide through the end of 2019.\n\nPrescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)\n\nIn its most recent step to combat the crisis, HCA Healthcare’s Physician Services Group (PSG) is installing a platform that seamlessly connects each state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) to a provider’s EHR.\n\nThe tool allows providers to quickly perform multi-state checks and monitor real-time controlled substance data directly from their patient’s health record, saving time, improving care and preventing patient harm. PSG successfully piloted the platform in Virginia earlier this year.\n\nAccording to Dr. Ott, providers have appreciated the ease of use of the platform. “We have established safeguards and processes over the past five years to reduce the risks associated with medication management in the outpatient space. The integration of this platform is a huge step forward in helping to combat the opioid crisis and protect our patients, their families, and the communities we serve,” he said.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}
{"url": "https://news.uthscsa.edu/ut-health-san-antonio-to-lead-statewide-collaborative-to-treat-opioid-use-disorder/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "SAN ANTONIO (Feb. 13, 2020) — The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) has awarded UT Health San Antonio a $7.2 million contract to lead a new collaborative. The collaborative will provide compassionate, evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder throughout the state, regardless of patients’ ability to pay.\n\nJennifer Sharpe Potter, Ph.D., M.P.H., is leading the Texas Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (TxMOUD) initiative. TxMOUD represents the largest training and technical assistance effort in Texas for opioid use disorder (OUD). The multi-pronged program will educate medical providers in prescribing evidence-based treatment, manage a network of trained health providers throughout the state, administer funding to providers for patients who are unable to pay, and track the initiative’s success and patient outcomes.\n\n“Recovery from opioid use disorder is possible. Most people don’t realize that OUD is a treatable medical condition. These dollars will improve quality of care and provide access to life-saving treatment.” said Dr. Potter, professor of psychiatry and vice dean for research in the Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).\n\n“We are proud to be leading this movement to change how opioid use disorder is treated in Texas because we believe all people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect as they navigate treatment options,” she added.\n\nTxMOUD builds on the highly successful program, GetWaivered Texas, that Dr. Potter and her team developed to streamline the Drug Enforcement Agency’s waiver process for prescribing buprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication used to treat OUD. Prescribing buprenorphine requires a DEA X-waiver. With only 1,500 waivered providers in Texas when GetWaivered Texas started in March 2019, the program trained an additional 700 providers in the past year. Through TxMOUD, these providers are encouraged to join a statewide treatment network. Health care providers will have access to ongoing training and support, and communities will have expanded access to treatment. This addresses an issue that is particularly problematic for rural communities.\n\nResearch has shown that substance use disorders are a leading cause of disease and death in the U.S. and directly cause cancer, overdose death, psychiatric disorders and suicide. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioid overdose is the leading cause of accidental death, exceeding automobile crashes and ﬁrearm fatalities. And a new study published Feb. 5 in the open access journal JAMA Network Open showed that buprenorphine and methadone to be the most successful treatments for patients with OUD.\n\nClinical trials have shown that buprenorphine can help manage withdrawal symptoms. About 50 percent of people with OUD who take buprenorphine can resume a normal life. The drug reduces opioid craving and relieves withdrawal symptoms, Dr. Potter explained. It also can be prescribed to be used at home, just like an antibiotic. Meanwhile, methadone is a highly regulated medication. To receive methadone, patients must go daily to a specialty clinic. TxMOUD will cover the cost of medication, including buprenorphine and naltrexone (two evidence-based treatments), and other treatment costs for those patients without the ability to pay for care.\n\n“TxMOUD is a critically important initiative, given a recent comparative effectiveness study published in JAMA Network Open, which examined the effectiveness of different treatments for OUD. In this national study, only buprenorphine and methadone reduced overdose and opioid-related symptoms. Importantly, naltrexone inpatient treatment and behavioral interventions did not. This TxMOUD program aligns perfectly with state-of-the-art treatment of opioid use disorder for Texans. We are proud and honored to lead this movement to change how opioid use disorder is treated in Texas,” Dr. Potter said.\n\nFor more information on TxMOUD initiatives, visit www.txmoud.org, email txmoud@uthscsa.edu, or call (210) 450-5370.\n\n###\n\nThe Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio is named for Texas philanthropists Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long.

{"url": "https://www.texasobserver.org/fentanyl-test-strips-texas-legislature/", "title": "Will Dan Patrick’s Senate Stymie Fentanyl Test Strip Legalization (Again)?", "published_at": "2025-05-06T13:00:00+00:00", "full_text": "On April 11, 2023, the Texas House voted 143-2 for a bill that would have legalized strips that test for the presence of the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, only for the legislation to die without a hearing in the Senate Criminal Justice Committee.\n\nSince then, at least 3,200 Texans have died from opioid overdoses, according to state data. A little more than a year after that House vote, in April 2024, at least nine people—that’s the official count, though the Texas Observer found it could have been as many as 12—died in just a few days in and around Austin, victims of a tainted batch of crack cocaine that caused dozens of fentanyl overdoses across the city. As the Observer reported earlier this year, legalized testing strips could have detected the presence of fentanyl in the adulterated crack, saving lives.\n\nNow, this April 23, the House unanimously passed House Bill 1644, a similar measure that would legalize strips that check for fentanyl as well as xylazine, a non-opioid tranquilizer that has been found in the U.S. drug supply. That legislation is now exactly where its predecessor died, the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, chaired by Senator Pete Flores, a Pleasonton Republican. Its supporters on both sides of the aisle are anxiously waiting to see if it fares better this session.\n\nCurrent state law makes it a misdemeanor to possess any materials for drug checking. That can include things like advanced laboratory equipment, but advocates have focused on strips: little pieces of paper that look like take-home COVID tests and alert to the presence of certain drugs.\n\n“They’re tools. These are testing strips. They’re not expensive. They’re incredibly effective and they’re drastically needed in our community,” said Eli Cortez, an organizer with Vocal-TX, an organization that advocates for reform on a wide range of issues including the war on drugs. “Having testing equipment so people know what’s in the substance they’re about to use is just so important right now.”\n\nAs the Observer previously reported, Texas has been slow to embrace practices associated with harm reduction, a broadly defined term for helping people who use drugs without stigmatizing or imposing strict parameters while also involving drug users in planning and implementation. The Observer’s investigation of the April 2024 overdoses in Austin found that many of those affected did not know they were consuming fentanyl. Though some Texas harm reduction organizations quietly distribute testing strips, their prohibition here limits what funds can be used to purchase them, and government agencies like Austin-Travis County EMS, which was instrumental in the response to the tainted crack, cannot distribute them. And in an atmosphere in which drug use is highly stigmatized, local officials did not share with the public information that experts said could have prevented additional overdoses. Though Texas has lagged behind other states in facilitating access to naloxone, the overdose reversal drug commonly sold as Narcan, the state government, along with Austin and Travis County, has recently ramped up distribution. Its widespread availability undoubtedly saved lives in Austin.\n\nThe year the testing strip bill failed, 2023, was the deadliest for overdoses in Texas history: More than 5,000 people perished of overdoses from all types of drugs, according to state data. (Researchers say Texas probably undercounts overdose deaths because most counties rely on poorly trained justices of the peace to handle death investigations.) Last year, Texas partly followed the national trend of overdoses decreasing. From July 2023 to July 2024, Centers for Disease Control numbers showed overdoses nationally falling nearly 17 percent, whereas Texas saw a smaller 4 percent decrease.\n\nThe liberal bastions of Oregon and Washington, which have taken less punitive approaches to addressing overdoses, saw slight increases in overdoses. Texas leaders have attributed this to the tough-on-drugs approach they’ve embraced. But researchers and harm reductionists say that when a new drug hits the market in a region, overdoses almost inevitably spike, then recede as health workers and people who use drugs adapt. They say Texas is lagging behind the rest of the country to implement policies, like the testing strip bill, that would save lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 2023 to November 2024 CDC numbers show Texas has made more progress reducing overdoses with a nearly 15 percent decrease, but it still didn’t keep up with the nationwide decrease of 26 percent. Washington and Oregon, meanwhile, showed significant turnarounds with decreases of 12 and 20 percent.\n\nThe prevalence of naloxone and people adjusting how they use drugs are likely part of why overdoses are falling. A darker explanation looms as well: Many people who were most at risk of a fentanyl overdose have passed away.\n\n“People are getting better and better over time at safer using practices,” said Claire Zagorski, a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Austin who’s worked in harm reduction for years. “And the denominator is changing. People are dying and we have fewer people being exposed to these high-risk drugs.”\n\nThat means the narrowness of Oliverson’s bill may limit its utility. “Over the years, this is going to keep changing,” Zagorski said. “It’s going to be less fentanyl and more something else.”\n\nBut the bill’s supporters say giving people who use drugs and public health workers a better idea of what’s in the supply will still save lives, even if some would like to see all forms of drug checking legalized. Fentanyl remains a huge issue, especially for people who don’t regularly use opioids. And while xylazine is a big problem in other states, researchers in Texas don’t believe it’s widespread here—yet.\n\nWhat the testing strip bill’s chances of passing are this time around is unclear. Lege watchers say that some Republicans in the Senate—generally run as a tight ship by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick—remain opposed to any legislation around drug use that isn’t enforcement-focused.\n\nFlores, the Criminal Justice Committee chairman, hasn’t given a hearing to an identical Senate bill referred to his committee back in February, even though it has bipartisan support. One of that bill’s authors is Senator Bob Hall, an Edgewood Republican who rose out of the Tea Party movement in 2014. Oliverson, an anesthesiologist and the legislation’s House shepherd two sessions in a row, has staked out far-right positions on other issues. But their conservative bona fides haven’t been enough to get their bills a hearing before Flores, who didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\n“Obviously people use drugs,” Oliverson said during an April hearing of the House Public Health Committee. “I wish they didn’t. I want to be clear that I’m not somebody who supports the idea of illicit drug use, but we live in a country, we live in a world, where drug addiction is a mental illness, and I want everyone to get treatment for it. But I can’t treat you when you’re dead.”", "source_domain": "www.texasobserver.org"}

RCORP partners include, from left, Thenral Mangadu, UTEP associate professor of public health sciences; Julie Priego, Aliviane, Inc., divisional director prevention/intervention; and Rosa Escalante, RCORP program coordinator. Photo: Ivan Pierre Aguirre, UTEP Communications.\n\nUTEP’s MARC is one of four regional consortium partners led by Aliviane Inc., the principle recipient of the three-year grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP). Other partners include the Texas State Department of Health Services Office of Border Public Health, and Presidio County Health Services.\n\nThe consortium will implement prevention, treatment and recovery services for substance use disorders, including opioid use disorders, in Texas Public Health Service Region 10, which includes Hudspeth, Culberson, Presidio, Brewster and Jeff Davis counties.\n\n“During the planning phase of this grant, our consortium successfully assessed the need for prevention, treatment and recovery services for people with substance and opioid abuse disorders and developed a strategic and workforce development plan for these five Texas rural counties,” said Thenral Mangadu, M.D., Ph.D., UTEP associate professor of public health sciences and MARC’s executive director. “With the support from HRSA’s Rural Communities Opioid Response Program, our consortium will be the main interdisciplinary service provider for substance use disorders and opioid use disorders in the region.”\n\nAccording to Mangadu, approximately 24,609 residents, mostly Mexican-American, live in the five West Texas rural counties. The area has been designated a federal Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) for its lack of providers. About 37% of residents are uninsured and 22% live along the poverty line.\n\n“The rural counties of Hudspeth, Culberson, Presidio, Brewster and Jeff Davis have limited to no access to life-saving substance use disorder (SUD) or opioid use disorder (OUD) prevention and treatment services,” said Ivonne Tapia, Aliviane Inc. chief executive officer. Through the consortium, partners will be able to leverage resources and expand access to SUD/OUD prevention, treatment, recovery support services, a trained workforce and the creation of a sustainability plan aimed at reducing cost of care for individuals living in the targeted rural counties, Tapia said.\n\nAdrian Billings, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Preventative Care Health Services, also known as Presidio County Health Services, said that part of the isolation of practicing in a Health Professional Shortage Area is the absence of resources for patients and physicians. He said he hopes that this collaboration will increase resources for his patients and the physicians who are caring for this vulnerable patient population.\n\n“Our clinic is the only clinic between El Paso, Del Rio and Midland-Odessa offering buprenorhpine treatment for opioid dependent patients,” Billings said. “Our patients do not currently have access to substance abuse counselors or local narcotics anonymous meetings to augment their buprenorphine prescription treatment.”\n\nFunds will be used to implement workforce, service delivery, and sustainability plans that focus on prevention, treatment and recovery with service providers in all five counties. Plans also will address the risk of HIV, hepatitis C virus, and mental health disparities associated with substance use disorders and opioid use disorders.\n\nAdriana Corona Luevanos, Office of Border Public Health (OBPH) program manager, said the OBPH will help the consortium implement all core project activities, including providing feedback on detailed assessment and analysis, strategic planning, and workforce and sustainability plan development.\n\nIn August 2020, HRSA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, awarded over $101 million to 116 organizations in 42 states and the District of Columbia to combat substance use disorders and opioid use disorders.

To curb opioid misuse and addiction in our communities, HCA Healthcare is hosting our second annual national “Crush the Crisis” opioid take back day, which provides communities with an opportunity for safe disposal of unused and unwanted medications. Find out more below…\n\nHCA Healthcare has announced its second annual national “Crush the Crisis” event to raise awareness about the dangers of opioid misuse and proper disposal of medications. On Saturday, October 24, in alignment with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, approximately 95 HCA Healthcare facilities across 16 states will partner with local law enforcement agencies to collect unused and expired prescription medications at events across the country.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 2 million people in the U.S. suffered from an opioid use disorder and more than 67,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2018. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the U.S. is seeing an increase in opioid usage, with 40 states reporting increases in opioid-related mortality, according to the American Medical Association (AMA).\n\nDr. Michael Schlosser, chief medical officer of HCA Healthcare’s national group and vice president of group operations, Clinical Operations Group\n\n“The misuse of prescription opioids often begins when the drugs are obtained from a friend or family member’s medicine cabinet, making it more important than ever to get unused pain medications out of homes and safely discarded,” said Dr. Michael Schlosser, chief medical officer of HCA Healthcare’s national group and vice president of group operations, Clinical Operations Group.\n\nSchlosser continues, “We were thrilled at the success of last year’s ‘Crush the Crisis’ events and look forward to continuing the fight against opioid abuse on October 24.”\n\nThe idea for HCA Healthcare’s “Crush the Crisis” came from Sara Stedman, an orthopedic nurse who has witnessed the effects of opioid addiction. In 2017, Stedman inspired a single take back event at TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and the following year HCA Healthcare’s TriStar Division joined her cause, with eight hospitals collecting more than 224 pounds of medication.\n\nSara Stedman, orthopedic nurse at HCA Healthcare’s TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn.\n\n“In every community, people are losing their jobs, losing their families, losing their lives, because of opioid abuse, and I felt like I needed to act,” said Stedman. “Thanks to the continuous support of HCA Healthcare and those across the country that participated, we’re making a real impact by removing harmful drugs from our communities.”\n\nLast year, “Crush the Crisis” was rolled out nationally, spanning 100 locations across 16 states, with 5,887 pounds of medication collected. This equates to over 4 million doses of unused medication.\n\nHCA Healthcare’s 2019 “Crush the Crisis” opioid take back events collected 5,887 pounds of unused, unwanted and expired medication.\n\nThis year, COVID-19 safety protocols will be in place at the events, including universal masking, social distancing, and the removal of high-touch items.\n\nTo further help combat the nation’s opioid crisis, HCA Healthcare proudly collaborates with and provides clinical insight to the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic. HCA Healthcare has committed $750,000 to the Collaborative to support the development of safer pain management protocols and reversal of the opioid crisis.\n\nAs a learning health system, HCA Healthcare uses data from approximately 35 million annual patient encounters to help continuously improve care. The organization uses the science of “big data” to reduce opioid misuse and transform pain management, with initiatives in surgical, emergency and other care settings, including:\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR): a multi-modal approach to pain management using pre, intra and post-operative interventions to optimize outcomes. HCA Healthcare’s ESR programs have demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and patient satisfaction and, importantly, up to a 50.8% decrease in opioid use in data collected from 124,000 major abdominal, joint, gynecologic oncology, spinal and bariatric surgeries from January 2018 through August 2020.\n\nALTernatives to Opioids in the Emergency Room (ALTO in the ER): a multi-modal approach to acute pain management, which focuses on alternative medication to hit various pain receptors as a first line treatment for common painful conditions. Initial results of ALTO pilot programs demonstrate a 36% reduction in opioid administrations.\n\na multi-modal approach to acute pain management, which focuses on alternative medication to hit various pain receptors as a first line treatment for common painful conditions.

Courtesy De La Cruz Family\n\nDe La Cruz said she and her husband came to the U.S. in 2007 to give their children better opportunities and obtain better medical care for Rosa Maria, who was three months old at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rosa Maria was traveling with her cousin, a U.S. citizen, from Laredo, Texas, to Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi when the vehicle was stopped at an interior border checkpoint, the family said. De La Cruz had not traveled to the hospital with Rosa Maria because of her own immigration status, an attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union said.\n\nWhen Border Patrol agents discovered that Rosa Maria was not in the U.S. legally, they accompanied the ambulance to the hospital and stayed outside of her room while she recovered from surgery, according to an attorney for the family.

Leticia Gonzalez, the attorney for Rosa Maria's family, said her hospital discharge papers state she should be cared for by her family. Gonzalez said Dr. Haroon Patel has been able to see Rosa Maria at the shelter, but not her primary care doctor.

And that’s how he likes it", "published_at": "2024-12-06T00:00:00", "full_text": "Denver comedian Josh Blue has been in the national spotlight for two decades. His breakthrough came in 2006 when he won “Last Comic Standing.” Since then, he’s only sharpened his timing and delivery. But as he releases his fifth comedy special, “Freak Accident,” he says there is still a lot to learn.\n\n“What’s beautiful about stand-up is I’ll never figure it out completely. Every time I think I’ve got something pinned down, something new in the world happens or my brain puts a new connection together,” he told Colorado Matters.\n\nIn his new special, filmed at Comedy Works South in Greenwood Village, Colo., Blue invites audiences to laugh along with him at his disability (he has cerebral palsy), his divorce, child-rearing, and the absurdity of life.\n\nEditor's note: Blue’s interview with Senior Host Ryan Warner below has been lightly edited.\n\nRyan Warner: Going into a special like this, do you think, “What is the balance of jokes I'm going to make about my disability versus other stuff?”\n\nJosh Blue: There's no map on that. I've never written anything down physically. It's just all kind of off the top of my head. So it's basically whatever happens in my life in that timeframe.\n\nWarner: If you don't write stuff down, does that mean you've lost jokes occasionally?\n\nBlue: Oh, I probably have three specials worth of lost jokes.\n\nWarner: Tell us about your right arm, because it's the brunt of many of your jokes in the show.\n\nBlue: It does its own thing. Having cerebral palsy, the arm is doing whatever it wants. Over the years, I've been able to control it a bit. Right now I'm sitting on it. That way it's not fidgeting with the dials and stuff. It's a very mischievous body part.\n\nWarner: In the special, you imagine that it has its own mind– that it orders things from mail-in catalogs or the internet.\n\nBlue: Yeah, and obviously, I take it over the top, but that's how it feels. Definitely my whole life, it's been like having a raccoon attached to my body.\n\nHart Van Denburg/CPR News Comedian Josh Blue stops by the CPR News studios, on Dec. 3, 2024.\n\nWarner: Were you always able to laugh at it, or did you come to that at some point?\n\nBlue: Yeah, as a kid in elementary school and junior high, there was definitely a learning curve– of how to not be sad about being disabled. But eventually, I realized that I had the gift of humor. Once I learned that, I was able to throw myself under the comedic bus. It just broke the ice completely. I was definitely the class clown and I was one of the only disabled kids in my school. And what I learned is they don't send the disabled kid to detention, so I got away with a lot of stuff, Ryan. A lot of stuff.\n\nWarner: Were you made fun of in school?\n\nBlue: There was a little bit of that, but I also was friends with everybody, so I could go from lunch table to lunch table. If anybody ever did mess with me, I would just tell somebody. Then they would regulate that for me … and also, the right arm will do some damage if you get too close.\n\nWarner: Disability, raising kids, divorce. You defuse a lot of life's heavier topics with humor. What in your life right now is comedy helping you cope with?\n\nBlue: If you watch my first special ‘til now, you'll see the progression of my life. Everything in it is raw. My first special, I'm talking about being a dad for the first time, and now my kids are teenagers. So I'm into “how do I deal with these teens?” sort of thing. And again, humor is such an amazing cure-all. I'm able to laugh with my teens. Maybe we have some tough topics, but I'm able to deal with it at home with humor, but then also take snippets and cater it to the greater audience that also is suffering with teenagers.\n\nWarner: In a way, you're testing material with your kids, or at least it's sort of incubating there.\n\nBlue: Yeah. And I feel like maybe if they watch all my specials, they'll probably need some psychiatric help.\n\nWarner: During this special, when you tell a joke, maybe one that's a little off-color, and especially when you get a big laugh, you get a subtle grin on your face. It makes me think, “Josh Blue is a big kid who delights in getting away with stuff he probably couldn't as much when he was little.” Do you think that's true?\n\nBlue: I love doing it, man. When I get the crowd to laugh at something that maybe is out of their comfort zone, it makes me giggle. It makes me laugh. And I'm like, \"I got them. I got them.\" And it is contagious. It really is. When you see me perform in a special, it's fun. But until you see me live, I don't think people know how fun the energy is in the room because I'm playing off of what's happening in the moment. And that's where you can really feel my true joy and energy of being in the moment.\n\nArthur Silk Denver comedian Josh Blue taped his fifth special, \"Freak Accident,\" at Comedy Works South in Greenwood Village, Colo.\n\nWarner: Are there sacrifices for a comedian who lives in Colorado – versus the stand-up hot spots of New York, Chicago, LA?\n\nBlue: For me, winning Last Comic Standing in '06, I was living here and it just skyrocketed me onto the national scene, so I never had to go to LA or New York to get discovered. And then, I just became a touring comic. And I've been doing 200 shows a year since then. I don't drive. So LA is not great for a non-driver. What I did miss was getting to rub elbows with a bunch of other headlining comics. I miss out on going to the Comedy Store on a Monday when all the comics come back from tour– just this comic jamboree of who's who. So I missed out on maybe getting on people's podcasts just because they don't know me from the scene.\n\nWarner: Is that something you have to fight against?\n\nBlue: I would love to, but my kids are in school, so I don't really have that opportunity to go do that right now. Maybe later in my career, once they're off to college, I can go and do some more of that. But it's not like they don't know who I am. They just don't think of me right away. When a TV sitcom comes up and they're like, \"Oh, we need a character.\" I'm just not on that radar.\n\nWarner: Was this special a single taping or several nights edited together?\n\nBlue: It was two shows, one night. That was part of the reason it took so long to edit this. The woman in the front row had a big pink bow on the first show. And then in the same seat, the second show was a 300-pound man in flannel. So it's very obvious if you look for that.\n\nArthur Silk Denver comedian Josh Blue taped his fifth special, \"Freak Accident,\" at Comedy Works South in Greenwood Village, Colo.\n\nWarner: Before we go, have your timing and delivery changed since you've started?\n\nBlue: I feel like I've always had impeccable timing. Even as a kid, I could just zip something in with the teacher and the whole class would laugh. I've always had that gift, but I feel like it has definitely evolved and I've gotten more comfortable in the silence. I'll let something ride longer, the laughter go, and then when I do hit them, it's even harder. What's beautiful about stand-up is I'll never figure it out completely. Every time I think I’ve got something pinned down, something new in the world happens or something in my brain puts a new connection together. There's no end to this.\n\nWarner: Silence is scary. So you’ve had to get used to that.\n\nBlue: I have a bit where somebody will get up to go to the bathroom and I'll be like, \"Where are you going?\" And they'll go, \"To the bathroom.\" And I'll be like, \"You want me to wait?\" And then I will wait the entire time they're gone. And it gets a laugh without me saying anything. And I mean, minutes go by without me saying something– just a facial expression or body movement, I can get it. And when they come back, it's like a standing ovation. These people are so happy this person came back from the bathroom. It's really fun.\n\nJosh Blue performs December 19-21 at Comedy Works Downtown.", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org"}

Additionally, app users remained in treatment nearly 19% longer than those treated with medication alone.\n\n“These findings suggest that augmenting medication for opioid use disorder with app-based contingency management may provide clinical benefits for underserved patients,” said Elise Marino, PhD, director of research operations at UT Health San Antonio’s Be Well Institute on Substance Use and Related Disorders. “Expanding the availability of app-based contingency management may contribute to decreasing the immense societal, economic and personal burden of opioid use.”\n\nMarino is lead author of the study, titled, “Smartphone App-Based Contingency Management and Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcomes,” published in JAMA Network Open. The other authors also are with UT Health San Antonio’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Be Well Institute.\n\nA need to augment medication\n\nOpioid use disorder continues to be a national crisis, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality. Its annual societal cost in the United States hit $968.9 billion in 2018, the study notes.\n\nMedication for opioid use disorder, or MOUD – including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone – is recognized as the only evidence-based treatment for the condition. This first-line treatment has been shown to significantly decrease opioid-related morbidity and mortality, and with consistent cost-saving benefits.\n\nHowever, some patients still experience difficulties reducing opioid use and staying with their treatment, pointing to a need to augment MOUD. Many conditions benefit from dual treatment of medication and therapy. One therapy is contingency management, or CM, which provides financial incentives for accomplishing treatment goals.\n\nThis therapy traditionally has been delivered in clinics, with the goal of an opioid-negative finding from urine drug screens. While findings have been mixed, several reviews and studies have found that individuals treated with MOUD plus CM had better retention and fewer opioid-positive results from urine drug screens.\n\nA long-standing limitation, however, is that patients are required to attend multiple in-person appointments per week for the therapy. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many were unwilling to make in-person CM visits. Additional access barriers, such as transportation, distance from the clinic and arranging child care, have supported other options like telehealth and leveraging new technologies.\n\nThere’s an app\n\nOne such technology is the WEconnect Health CM smartphone app. The app delivers evidence-based CM embedded in a recovery-oriented framework. In addition to providing substance-related behavioral targets, it permits patients to set daily goals that are personally meaningful, both substance use-related and otherwise, like attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, going for a walk or reading.\n\nThe app also includes a platform for tracking patients’ progress and payment, and provides encouragement for completing their daily goals. Additionally, WEconnect offers 1-to-1 peer support and online meetings facilitated by certified peers. In contrast to traditional CM, the app permits patients to make decisions regarding their own goals for treatment and to explore recovery through peer support services available anywhere and accessible outside of normal clinic hours.\n\nFor the new research, the scientists set out to evaluate whether augmenting MOUD with app-based CM is associated with fewer days of opioid use at the end of treatment and greater retention than treatment with MOUD only.\n\nThe retrospective cohort study, which refers to research that follows a group of people over time, used data from Nov.1, 2020, to Nov. 30, 2023, collected from opioid treatment programs across Texas. The cohort included 600 individuals aged 18 years or older who were uninsured or underinsured and who chose to receive MOUD only or MOUD plus CM delivered by the WEconnect smartphone app.\n\nThose who chose to receive MOUD plus app-based CM reported a mean duration of 8.4 days of opioid use at the end of treatment compared with 12 days for those who chose to receive MOUD only. Retention analysis showed that patients who chose to receive MOUD plus app-based CM stayed with their treatment for a mean duration of 290.2 days, compared with 236.1 days for those choosing to receive MOUD only.\n\n“These results are promising, and they highlight the potential importance of a patient’s decision to use app-based CM,” the researchers concluded. “Despite the challenges of engaging patients in other app-based interventions, adding recovery-oriented, app-based CM may be one way to enhance clinical care and meet the growing needs of historically underserved patients taking MOUD.”\n\nUT Health San Antonio is a world-class research university, ranking at the top 5% among institutions globally for clinical medicine according to U.S. News & World Report. It is No. 12 in the world among universities for the impact of its discoveries – in normalized citation impact, which compares the number of citations its research receives per paper to the average for similar published work, a recognized core measure of research impact.\n\n\n\nSmartphone App-Based Contingency Management and Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcomes\n\nElise N.

She had some Narcan at home, just in case. But still, as a longtime resident of Abilene, she didn’t think it was something HER community had to worry about, “It wasn’t until June the 12th of 2023 that I discovered fentanyl is right in my in my own house. And that was my son, Jerrin Hernandez’s first overdose,” said Lewis.\n\nLewis noticed Jerrin acting strangely the night before. That morning, when she went to wake him up, it was obvious something was wrong, “He was not breathing, and he was purple and his lips were purple, and he was making this awful gurgling sound… And so immediately I ran and got the Narcan and called 911.” This is Lewis telling her story to the Abilene city council earlier this summer. She told the crowd how Jerrin survived but suffered from short-term memory loss. He overdosed again that August, and, finally, a third time in December 2023. “I am one of the mothers who lost their child to fentanyl last year.”\n\nKrystal Lewis was one of several people who came to this June city council meeting to talk about Abilene’s fentanyl problem. They told city leaders they needed to be doing much more. Most attendees were not prepared for the testimonies they heard that morning. That might be because, if someone hasn’t been personally affected by fentanyl, it seems like an epidemic that lives in the headlines, not their backyard. But Dr. John Russell, an emergency physician at Hendrix Health in Abilene, says the crisis is here. And it’s growing, “We have seen an increase in the overall numbers of fentanyl-related, illnesses and deaths. the most likely outcome was somebody overdoses on fentanyl.”\n\nCompared to other narcotics that land people in the ER, Russell says an overdose from fentanyl is far worse. “If somebody is using heroin, that’s probably the closest thing. but with fentanyl, it just occurs so much more rapidly. People stop breathing from opioid overdoses just because they don’t even care to breathe.” It’s become such an issue in Abilene, that just last month, some local organizations installed a Narcan vending machine near downtown.\n\nA few weeks after the city council meeting, I met with Krystal Lewis and her husband. Since Jerrin’s death, they’ve learned everything they can about the epidemic, and want to share that information, “76% of overdoses 14 to 23 are fentanyl-related, and 70% of those are males. People who have experienced a non-fatal drug overdose are at a higher risk of a fatal overdose than those who have not.”\n\nLewis says Jerrin’s death devastated the family. But two months afterward, she suddenly felt called to DO something, “ I woke up on Saturday morning and this is placed on my heart and immediately just started making phone calls and, you know, we really didn’t know what we were doing at all. And, you know, that’s what the kind of beautiful thing God takes the unqualified, makes him qualified, and he makes a way. And I know that he is going to make Jerrin’s Hope possible.”\n\nJerrins Hope is what she’s calling a regional youth treatment center she’s trying to start in Abilene. She envisions a center that offers a comprehensive range of services, including mental health support and substance abuse counseling. And while the center’s mission will be deeply rooted in faith, Lewis wants it to be a place that can help everyone. “It is a faith-based rehabilitation center, and there is I mean, we’re not going to say no to any kid that wants to come. Does it matter if you’re satanic or, you know what color the color of your skin is, or what your sexual preference is, none of that matters.”\n\nWith her husband Huery, Lewis is hard at work making their dream of the center become a reality. She’s also making sure the community doesn’t forget about the harms of fentanyl. From sharing her testimony at public events to speaking with local law enforcement, Lewis is determined that Jerrin and others like him aren’t forgotten. And it seems her efforts are paying off. Sargent Dale Watson agrees the crisis can’t be ignored. He’s with the Taylor County Sheriff’s Office and has been in law enforcement for 27 years. He calls the rise in Abilene’s fentanyl cases “the quickest growth of any drug I’ve ever seen, I haven’t seen anything like it in my career other than heroin and crack So my advice is for parents to make sure the kids know that if they take a pill, if it’s going to be fentanyl, it’s going to have to on it’s not going to be a legitimate pill. It just doesn’t even exist anymore, you know, on the street.”\n\nWatson says the sheriff’s office has focused on targeting narcotics traffickers, often starting with minor players and working up to larger networks. He says most fentanyl in Abilene can be traced back to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. As Watson sees the epidemic extend across demographics in Abilene, he welcomes things like Jerrin’s Hope and says the community desperately needs more resources for rehabilitation and prevention, “We do not invest enough in that. And the number of people in this town and every city in America that has drug addicts, who would desire not to be, but there’s not enough resources available. So anytime anyone says, hey, we’re thinking of doing a rehabilitation center or thinking of funding this, I’m always for it.”\n\nWhile Jerrin’s Hope is still in its early stages, Krystal Lewis hopes to have it off the ground in the next few years.", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org"}

One of the children tested positive at a local hospital for fentanyl through a urine sample, according to the arrest affidavit in Roberts's case.\n\nThe home was one of two in Aurora which Denver prosecutors believed Roberts and his team produced millions of fentanyl pills -- as many as six-hundred thousand per month -- between January and August of 2024. The pills were distributed throughout the Denver metro area, as stated by the Denver District Attorney's Office in a press release.\n\nThe home in the 1800 block of Olathe Street in Aurora that was raided in May 2024 by local and federal agents as part of a fentanyl pill manufacturing operation. A 33-year-old man, Tashon Roberts, was sentenced Friday to 145.5 years in the Colorado Department of Corrections. CBS\n\nDenver police officers, the Aurora SWAT team, and agents from both the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Homeland Security Investigations donned protective suits and raided Roberts's home and drug \"laboratory\" in the 1800 block of Olathe Street on May 1, 2024. Aside from three pill presses found in a room dedicated to that process, others were found in a closet and in the unfinished garage. Some of the presses had white powder loaded in the hoppers.\n\nPlastic baggies of fentanyl pills were found throughout the home. Once was floating in the toilet tank, according to the affidavit. Roberts and three other adults were taken into custody. The three children were turned over to Arapahoe County Department of Human Services.\n\nThat raid occurred two months after a woman was questioned by Denver officers after she left the home. Officers began conducting surveillance on the home after receiving tips from other drug case defendants. The woman arrived in an Uber, according to the affidavit. When she left, an unknown black man walked to curb and looked both ways along the street, presumably looking for any law enforcement vehicles following the Uber. The surveilling officers avoided detection and managed to pull over the Uber driver for not using a turn signal. The woman in the rear passenger seat was arrested for drug possession and also named Roberts and others in the Olathe home as her suppliers of several years.\n\nTashon Roberts following his arrest last year on drug charges. Denver District Attorney's Office\n\nOne of Roberts's companions in the Olathe drug-making operation was 35-year-old Coleman Phillips. All but one felony drug distribution charge against Phillips was dropped in October of last year. He was release on a $500 cash bond. He has not been sentenced yet.\n\nAnother adult arrested as a result of the Olathe raid was Imani Hale. The 29-year-old pleaded not guilty to felony drug and child abuse charges in April. She is scheduled for jury trial in September.\n\nThe fourth adult from the Olathe raid was not identified in the affidavit.\n\nAn HSI agent in El Paso, Texas, provided Denver investigators with information about Roberts's purchase of at least one pill press from a China-based website in 2021 and 2022. The website, TDPMolds.com, was sanctioned in 2023 by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and shut down.\n\nThe die molds or stamps from the pill presses in the Olathe home were removed by a Denver detective. They showed an imprint of \"M30,\" reflecting the crew was producing counterfeit oxycodone pills.\n\nThe presses were destroyed by the Aurora Fire Department and disposed of, per the affidavit.\n\nThe second Aurora home used as part of the team's pill production was not referenced in the original affidavit, suggesting investigators did not discover it until after Roberts was arrested.\n\n\"We are pleased to hear that Mr. Roberts, who knew that what he was doing greatly endangered lives in our city, will be off the streets for many years,\" stated Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas after Roberts was found guilty. \"The warning 'One Pill Can Kill' is absolutely true, and the dismantling of this fentanyl pill-making operation has potentially saved lives by ending a significant supply of fentanyl pills into our community. Our investigators did an incredible job uncovering the operation and those behind it, and we will continue aggressively pursuing anyone manufacturing or dealing illicit narcotics in Denver.\"", "source_domain": "www.cbsnews.com"}

Learn more…\n\nColleagues at HCA Healthcare’s West Valley Medical Center in Caldwell, Idaho gear up to “Crush the Crisis”.\n\nThis year, residents in HCA Healthcare communities across the nation safely disposed of 13,523 pounds of medication at our “Crush the Crisis” opioid take back day events, more than doubling the medications collected in 2019. The events, which took place at 95 HCA Healthcare facilities across 18 states on October 24, 2020, in alignment with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, were aimed at educating communities on the dangers of opioid misuse and the importance of safe and proper disposal of expired and unused prescription medications.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the U.S. is seeing a significant increase in opioid usage, with 40 states reporting an increase in opioid-related mortality, according to the American Medical Association (AMA). “Crush the Crisis” called on communities across the country to address this timely issue. The events collectively disposed of an estimated 9.3 million doses of medication, eliminating the adverse possibility of potential misuse.\n\nHCA Healthcare colleagues at Blake Medical Center in Bradenton, Florida encourage their communities to safely dispose of unused, unwanted and expired medication.\n\n“Communities across the country came together in the midst of this global pandemic to properly dispose of expired and unused medications and make a difference in our battle against the opioid epidemic,” said Dr. Michael Schlosser, chief medical officer of HCA Healthcare’s national group and vice president of group operations, Clinical Operations Group. “Thank you to the DEA, local law enforcement agencies, hospital volunteers and all the many participants who showed up to help ‘Crush the Crisis.’”\n\nThe concept of “Crush the Crisis” was spearheaded by Sara Stedman, an orthopaedic nurse in HCA Healthcare’s TriStar Division, when she organized a single take back event at TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee in 2017. Last year, “Crush the Crisis” was rolled out nationally, spanning 100 locations across 16 states, with 5,887 pounds of medication collected.\n\nSwedish Medical Center in Englewood, Colorado teamed up with the Englewood Police Department for their 2020 “Crush the Crisis” event.\n\n“The idea for ‘Crush the Crisis’ came to me after I witnessed the devastating effects that opioid abuse can have on an individual and his or her family,” said Stedman. “Thanks to the backing of HCA Healthcare, it is truly remarkable to see how this simple idea has evolved into a national movement that’s helping to bring greater awareness to the dangers of opioid misuse and why it’s important to safely and properly dispose of these unused and expired medications before they fall into the hands of someone who may abuse them.”\n\nA total of 95 facilities across 18 states around the country participated in “Crush the Crisis” events by partnering with local law enforcement agencies to collect unused and expired prescription medications.

And that’s just how Cerebral Brewing wanted it.\n\nThe Denver brewer partnered with Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains and used the beer to raise money for the women’s health care organization that provides abortion services. It also represented a statement of its values. “It’s a cause we are really passionate about so we wanted to support them any way we could,” said Sean Buchan, Cerebral’s owner and head brewer.\n\nSami Hartman, the sales manager at Cerebral Brewing in Denver, holds four-packs of Hands Off My Fruit, a collaboration beer with Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. (Courtesy of Cerebral Brewing)\n\nThe beer — from the name referencing “The Handmaid’s Tale” to the can color matched to Planned Parenthood’s pink logo — showcases how breweries are increasingly putting politics into the pint in a time of heightened polarization. The partnership came after some states pushed to restrict abortions and take aim at the organization.\n\nA year ago, Denver Beer Co. debuted its sister Mexican-themed brewery, Cervecería Colorado, with the slogan #BridgesNotWalls. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democratic presidential candidate, used the slogan on the taproom wall as a backdrop for a recent political event in Denver.\n\nCannonball Creek Brewing in Golden makes a session IPA called “Trump Hands,” named in reference to an insult about the president’s hands. And elsewhere in Colorado, brewers are hosting gay pride celebration events and donating part of their sales to community nonprofits with social causes.\n\nCerebral announced the Hand Off My Fruit release on Facebook like this: “While almost everything seems to be polarizing these days, we believe deeply that health care shouldn’t be. We share the belief that comprehensive and compassionate health care should be available and legal for anyone who seeks it. This belief is at the core of what Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains embodies and we are proud to stand with them in the best way we know how – brewing beer. “\n\nThe cans of the kettle sour with raspberries and pineapple sold out quickly, but the beer is still available on tap at Cerebral. The sales from the beer’s debut and donations at the launch party raised nearly $10,000 for Planned Parenthood’s educational arm, far more than the brewery’s past fundraisers for nonprofits.\n\nMolly Swank, the organization’s director of community engagement, said it allowed them to reach a new audience. “I think a lot of the people that came that night were just excited to see Cerebral standing with Planned Parenthood,” she said.\n\nThe crowd at Cerebral Brewing in Denver for the Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains fundraiser in July. (Courtesy of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains)\n\nCerebral is planning another beer collaboration later this year to support another political cause. Buchan sees more upside than downside.\n\n“I think you firm up your (loyalty) with the audience that shares that belief with you,” he said. “We are going to lose some people that we don’t share an ideology with anyway, and that’s the beauty of this industry and there are many other breweries they can support if they want to, and I’m not going to take offense to it.”\n\nMake more journalism like this possible with a Colorado Sun membership, starting at just $5 a month.\n\nNew Image Brewing in Arvada is another beermaker that lends its brand to social causes. Brandon Capps, the owner and brewer, said the “entire brand ethos is built off of mental health and wellness and promoting advocacy for it.”\n\nThe brewery’s name is a reference to Capps own journey. And New Image also sold cans under the name Better Together that included icons in support of LGBT causes. The proceeds from the beer support the Jefferson Center for Mental Health.\n\nBut what gave Capps and Buchan confidence to make the step into advocacy is a solid foundation and fan base. Capps said New Image needed to first prove itself as a brewery, and make its voice genuine.\n\n“We’ve tried to be really organic and not super in your face,” he said. “Craft beer is a really touchy and sensitive market … they don’t like being marketed and pandered to.”\n\nStill, Capps thinks the craft beer audience is a market filled with people who want something more than just an alcoholic beverage.\n\n“If I was trying to sell beer to people who didn’t want to talk about bigger issues, then I’d probably be making a different type of beer,” he said.", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com"}
{"url": "https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2016/danger-in-the-psych-ward/", "title": "Danger in the psych ward: Safety issues plague Universal Health Services-owned mental-health hospitals", "published_at": null, "full_text": "But the government compiled an unusual systemwide report on the company last summer at the request of congressmen from Illinois and Massachusetts, where a report by the Boston Globe and another by the Chicago Tribune revealed problems at Universal Health hospitals.\n\nFederal regulators usually focus only on incidents at individual hospitals, not across chains, so government data is fragmented and you can’t easily compare Universal Health to its peers. And the company operates hospitals under a variety of names that can make it difficult for patients and watchdogs to evaluate its overall care.\n\nHowever federal data suggests that Universal Health has a higher-than-average rate of problems, according to a News analysis of government reports on hospitals that receive funding from Medicaid and Medicare. For example, government inspectors investigating complaints found serious problems at 8.4 percent of Universal’s hospitals in 2014, the most recent full year for which data is available. Nationwide, that figure was 3 percent.\n\n“We are mindful that over the course of treating approximately 2.5 million patients per year, irregular and unpredictable events occasionally occur,” the company said in a statement in response to questions from The News.\n\nThe number of government safety citations simply reflects the chain’s size, according to the company, which is based in a suburb of Philadelphia. When problems have been brought to its attention, the company says, it has come up with plans to fix them.\n\nUniversal Health, which is valued by Wall Street at over $11 billion, says its overall safety record is excellent. It cites rising patient-satisfaction scores and above-average results on hospital-accreditation evaluations.\n\n“The large number of investigations aimed at misconduct within this hospital system is appalling,’’ said Dr. Peter Breggin, a New York-based psychiatrist who has consulted for the National Institute of Mental Health and the commission that accredits hospitals. “It is especially frightening that these deviations are occurring in the largest network of psychiatric hospitals in the country.’’\n\nInspectors found safety breaches at 13 of the company’s 26 such facilities in Texas, the hospital company’s largest market. Universal Health is the nation’s biggest for-profit provider of mental-health services, including treatment for depression and addiction, and also owns some full-service hospitals.\n\nAcross Texas and around the country, government inspectors investigating patient complaints cited 44 of the company’s hospitals for dangerously poor care or unsafe conditions between 2012 and mid-2015, according to data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services. That’s more than a quarter of the 154 company hospitals that The News identified as receiving taxpayer money to treat the poor and elderly.\n\nInspection data uncovered by The Dallas Morning News shows that serious safety problems have plagued dozens of mental-health hospitals owned by one giant chain: Universal Health Services Inc.\n\nIn San Angelo, hospital employees created infection risks by leaving an observation room covered in vomit and a kitchen black with grease and dead bugs.\n\nIIn Sherman, workers at a psychiatric ward dropped a suicidal patient off at a bus stop; a day later he was found dead after jumping from a Dallas bridge.\n\nThe News, which has exposed incidents at Timberlawn, the biggest psychiatric hospital in Dallas, obtained the report and underlying inspection material through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe numbers reveal that “patient complaints against the company aren’t just isolated to one region, but extend across the country,’’ said David Wright, deputy regional administrator in Dallas for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The federal agency, which monitors hospitals that receive government payments, developed the report.\n\nIn all cases, the violations were so egregious that the hospitals faced expulsion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, which cover the poor, disabled and elderly. More than a third of the money Universal Health took in for treating psychiatric patients last year came from those programs, according to the company’s financial filings.\n\nMost of the hospitals came up with acceptable plans to avoid expulsion, but company’s Timberlawn Mental Health System in Dallas was booted last year, and is in the process of reapplying.\n\nBased on the same inspection reports compiled by the federal government, Texas is seeking to shut down Timberlawn and fine it a record $1 million, The News reported earlier this month. The hospital is appealing.\n\nSome of the most serious problems at Timberlawn and other Universal Health hospitals stem from improper care of suicidal patients who harmed themselves.\n\n“One cannot get lax with suicide precautions ever,’’ said Dr. James Knoll, director of forensic psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, N.Y., who reviewed inspection reports for several Universal Health hospitals. The nagging question, he added, is what causes “the breakdown between an industry leader’s mission and its services in the trenches?’’\n\nThe union that represents about 1,800 Universal Health workers, out of more than 68,000, links the problems to inadequate staffing. It has pressed the company to create an independent committee of directors to oversee patient care.\n\nThe labor group also asked the company to invest more money in expanding its workforce, Ryan Pfeffer, research coordinator at Service Employees International Union, told The News.\n\nFederal regulations don’t require specific staffing levels. The company declined to comment on the union’s allegations, except to say that “we devote necessary resources to remediating any deficiencies’’ in care.\n\nExperts in psychiatric treatment say that hospital suicides can be prevented. Since 1979, the nonprofit Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has admitted at least 100,000 patients, said Dr. Geetha Jayaram, a psychiatrist there. Not one has committed suicide at the facility, she said.\n\nThe hospital has invested millions of dollars over many years to boost staffing so that it can screen and constantly monitor patients deemed at high risk for suicide, she said. Many hospitals, including Universal Health’s, have a policy of checking on patients only every 15 minutes.\n\nUniversal Health is profitable, reporting earnings of more than $680 million last year on revenues of about $9 billion. Company executives told investors last month that their psychiatric facilities have a 27 percent operating margin, making them far more profitable than the company’s regular hospitals.\n\nThe company is also at the center of a U.S. Supreme Court case where allegations of fraud, staffing problems and safety violations intersect.\n\n\"We're living with this giant hole in our lives every day. I don't really understand why industry changes have been so slow in coming.''​ - Anne Millar Williams, whose husband committed suicide a few days after he was released from a Universal Health hospital in Arkansas.\n\nA Massachusetts couple alleged in a lawsuit that one of the company’s clinics fraudulently billed Medicaid for services that unlicensed and unsupervised therapists provided to their teenage daughter. Inspectors identified 23 unlicensed therapists at the clinic, in violation of health regulations. The family said such breaches made the clinic’s billing claims bogus.\n\nUniversal Health contends regulations didn’t specifically make compliance a condition of getting paid by Medicaid. Its position has been backed in court by the American Hospital Association and other industry lobbying groups. The high court will hear arguments April 19.\n\nIn addition, the company faces separate and expanding investigations by the U.S. Justice Department and the inspector general for the Health and Human Services Department into potential billing fraud and other matters. The inquiries involve the corporate headquarters, according to the company’s financial filings, as well as about two dozen of its hospitals.\n\nAt least four of the hospitals cited for serious safety failures are also targets of billing inquiries, according to a review of company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNews about safety failures saddens Anne Millar Williams of Little Rock. Her late husband, John, was discharged from a Universal Health hospital there in 2006, less than 24 hours after he had told doctors he had planned to shoot himself. A few days later, he committed suicide.\n\nAfter members of the Millar family sued, Universal reached a confidential settlement with them. But a decade later, “We’re living with this giant hole in our lives every day,’’ she said. “I don’t really understand why industry changes have been so slow in coming.’’\n\nFreelance reporter Daniel Lathrop contributed to this report.\n\nSUICIDE HOTLINE:\n\nCall 24/7: 1 800 273-8255\n\nwww.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\n\nUnsettling cases\n\nGovernment regulators have cited at least three Universal Health Services psychiatric facilities in Texas since 2012 for failing to safeguard suicidal patients who went on to harm or kill themselves. The company did not comment on the individual cases but said “patient safety is our highest priority,’’ adding that 11 company facilities are now serving as pilot sites for a new suicide-prevention program. Here are descriptions of the incidents from government reports:\n\nTexoma Medical Center in Sherman\n\nIn July 2014, the hospital’s behavioral-health facility admitted a patient with “suicidal ideation’’ after he had jumped through a glass window. He was later found unconscious on the floor of his patient room with a “long elastic bandage around his neck’’ and blood in his mouth. He was resuscitated but suffered brain damage. Here's the report.\n\nTwo months later, another patient who had threatened to hang himself followed through, “slinging a knotted sheet over the door to his room and tying it around his neck.’’ Nurses pushed their way inside the room, where his body was blocking the door, just in time to save him. Here's the report.\n\nIn January 2015, another patient’s attempt proved fatal. The 33-year-old man checked into the hospital, confiding that he had suicidal thoughts and had come up with a plan to jump off a bridge. After 10 days at the facility, he was still under “suicide precautions” but the hospital discharged him. Less than 24 hours later, he was found dead underneath a bridge near the Trinity River. The Dallas County medical examiner ruled it suicide. Here's the report.\n\nAustin Oaks Hospital in Austin\n\nInspectors found that nurses violated the rights of a suicidal 15-year-old who had been raped by a relative. On Oct. 14, 2014, a male nurse, struggling to medicate her, “grabbed the patient’s gown with his right hand and ripped the gown off, leaving the patient completely nude.’’ She was shut in isolation, naked, for about 23 minutes. Regulators and experts say solitary confinement can re-traumatize patient and should be used only as a last resort. Here's the report.\n\nTimberlawn Mental Health System in Dallas\n\nA patient who was left unobserved hanged herself from a closet doorknob with a torn sheet on Dec. 3, 2014, after repeated threats to kill herself that way. Timberlawn’s policy was to check on patients only every 15 minutes, regulators said, but there was no evidence that occurred in this case.

France, PhD, to lead methocinnamox drug development program\n\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) was awarded a $12 million cooperative agreement (U01) from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse to further develop methocinnamox (MCAM) as a treatment for opioid use disorder. MCAM is a mu opioid receptor antagonist with a long duration of action that blocks the effects of opioids like fentanyl, heroin and oxycodone.\n\nCharles P. France, PhD, professor of pharmacology and psychiatry, Robert A. Welch Distinguished University Chair with the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine, is a leading expert on MCAM and is heading this drug development program.\n\nThis award will support the manufacture of MCAM for clinical trials, submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potentially a Phase 1 clinical trial.\n\nFrance has studied MCAM for the past seven years at UT Health San Antonio. He said the goals in the next phase of development are ambitious but achievable.\n\nHis laboratory will oversee the project and conduct additional basic research while separate companies will manufacture MCAM and manage clinical trials.\n\n“Making a compound in gram or milligram quantities is one thing, but to scale it up brings in a whole different set of challenges,” France said. Over the past several years the synthesis of MCAM was significantly improved and scaled up to kilogram quantities.\n\nFrance said they expect to have the required MCAM material manufactured near the end of 2024 and then have the IND application submitted in early 2025. A clinical trial could possibly begin 30 days after submission of the IND application.\n\n“We are very optimistic about having a good IND package and moving forward with clinical trials,” France said. Thanks in part to support from colleagues who are experts in the drug development process, the project has had a great deal of momentum and moved along rather quickly, he said.\n\nFrance currently has one patent in place and three pending for various aspects of MCAM.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nRead more about MCAM:", "source_domain": "news.uthscsa.edu"}

But using it to help doctors and researchers learn more about diseases and improve healthcare is anything but novel. Every year on May 20, the Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP) celebrates Clinical Trials Day to recognize the day James Lind, a ship’s surgeon in the British Royal Navy, started what is often considered the first randomized clinical trial in 1774 to study effects of different treatments for scurvy. Over the past 250 years, clinical trials have evolved into standardized procedures used to look at new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease.\n\nAcross HCA Healthcare, clinical research has brought forth new medications, new ways of doing surgery, new medical devices, new ways to use existing treatments and new ways to improve the quality of life for our patients with acute or chronic illnesses. Our research teams strive to advance medical knowledge and foster innovation through partnerships with top academic institutions (including a long-standing research collaboration with Harvard) and government health agencies like AHRQ, CDC and NIH. Large-scale trials employing practice-based research aim to advance clinical knowledge faster, and their real-world nature allows for results to be more broadly applicable to, and more rapidly incorporated into, real-world practice.\n\n“Research is simply the way we understand the world around us. It’s important to medicine and therefore, it’s important to HCA Healthcare. Whether it’s studying a new order set, a new way to staff our units, a new drug, device or even existing therapies – research is vitally important to healthcare and to American medicine.” DR. MICHAEL CUFFE, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER\n\nOur research projects involving antimicrobial stewardship, maternal health and COVID care have informed and improved patient care worldwide.\n\nREDUCE MRSA – Among nearly 75,000 patients across 43 HCA Healthcare hospitals, we found that using antimicrobial soap and ointment to decolonize all ICU patients reduced bloodstream infections by 44% and MRSA by 37%. The CDC has since adopted this practice.\n\nABATE Infection Trial – At 53 HCA Healthcare hospitals with 330,000 patients in 194 non-ICU units, we found an infection control technique achieved a 31% reduction in bloodstream infections and nearly a 40% reduction in antibiotic-resistant bacteria among non-ICU patients with central line catheters and lumbar drains.\n\n39 Weeks – We developed evidence-based perinatal protocols through our longstanding partnership with March of Dimes, such as prohibiting elective delivery prior to 39 weeks to help babies have a healthy start to life, finding lower risk for elective deliveries at term, informing the development of a national “Hard Stop” policy to prevent elective deliveries prior to 39 weeks.\n\nCHARGE – We formed a consortium of prominent public and private research institutions to use HCA Healthcare’s vast data on COVID-19 hospital care to improve patient outcomes and public knowledge.\n\nIn addition to these areas of focus, we invest in research related to trauma and burn care, nursing practice improvements, graduate medical education and much more. In recognition of Clinical Trials Day, we are shining a spotlight on the HCA Healthcare Research Institute, which has helped to improve care and quality outcomes for patients across the country.\n\nIn honor of Clinical Trials Day, HCA Healthcare colleagues celebrate the dedication of clinical research professionals to improving the health and well-being of our patients and advancing medical knowledge for generations to come.

In 1993, it all started with a goal to make cancer clinical trials accessible to the community without the support of an academic institution. The team established the first Phase 1 program in a community setting in 1997 and went on to become one of the largest programs of its kind in the world. Formally established as SCRI in 2004, it brought together community-based physicians, researchers and clinicians that conducted more than 600 first-in-human trials and became a clinical trial leader in the majority of approved cancer therapies in the last decade.\n\nIn June 2022, HCA Healthcare and McKesson announced plans to form a joint venture to expand clinical research services to improve cancer treatment options for patients. The joint venture combines the resources and expertise of McKesson’s US Oncology Research (USOR) and SCRI. Together, USOR and SCRI will create a fully integrated oncology research organization aimed at expanding clinical research, accelerating drug development and increasing availability and access to clinical trials for community oncology providers and patients, including those in underserved communities.\n\nToday, the HCA Healthcare Research Institute is the multispecialty clinical research arm of our organization focused on advancing therapies for patients through our affiliated network of providers and care sites. Colleagues and clinicians across HCA Healthcare work to leverage our size and scale to support clinical research needs and collaborate with industry partners to advance medicine.\n\nThe HCA Healthcare Research Institute has conducted more than 500 industry-sponsored trials and enabled service and business lines to conduct high-quality clinical research across our sites of care, including interventional (device, pharma), non-therapeutic (early detection, screenings) and records-based (outcomes, real-world data).\n\nThe areas that the HCA Healthcare Research Institute supports at 36 research sites include:\n\nCardiac and vascular\n\nNeuroscience\n\nRobotics\n\nOrthopedics and spine\n\nWomen’s and children’s\n\nInfectious disease\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nComplex gastrointestinal\n\nOncology\n\nPulmonary and thoracic\n\nBurn\n\nBehavioral Health\n\nThe HCA Healthcare Research Institute also offers multispecialty centralized and site support services for our facilities and large-scale clinical study support. Our research teams use real-world data to evaluate outcomes through advanced data analytics capabilities.\n\nIn 2023, HCA Healthcare affiliate Medical City Fort Worth participated in a heart failure implant clinical trial.

We believe that active and rigorous clinical trials and advancements lead to innovative care and quality outcomes both within HCA Healthcare and in the broader medical community.” MICHELLE ROWE, VICE PRESIDENT OPERATIONS, HCA HEALTHCARE RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nLeveraging partnerships is a key component to expanding the HCA Healthcare Research Institute’s research capabilities. HCA Healthcare maintains a clinical trial portfolio and data research collaborations with organizations like Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Abbott and approximately 140 sponsors of clinical trials. “Research and partnerships are fundamental to how we address our communities’ most pressing healthcare needs,” adds Michelle. “I truly believe patients don’t need to travel to get great care. They can get it in the communities where they live.”\n\nAs we commemorate 249 years of clinical trials and the vast advances in medical treatment and science that have occurred because of them, HCA Healthcare sends our gratitude to our clinical research professionals, colleagues and trial participants who champion clinical research for healthier tomorrows for all.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

How exactly did this child with developmental delays become the Trump administration’s target for deportation? It’s an egregious case of government overreach, and now the subject of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit.\n\nOn Oct. 24, 2017, Rosa Maria was traveling to Driscoll Children’s Hospital, which is 150 miles from Laredo, Texas, where she lives with her parents and siblings. She was accompanied by her 34-year old cousin, Aurora Cantu, who is a U.S. citizen. Around 2 a.m., Customs and Border Protection stopped her medical transport vehicle at a checkpoint in Freer, Texas. Border Patrol agents approached the vehicle and asked to see everyone’s “papers.” After she and the driver provided their identification, Aurora explained that they were on their way to a hospital and that Rosa Maria needed an operation. She showed the agents medical documentation and explained that at 10 years old, Rosa Maria did not carry ID.\n\nNonetheless, the vehicle was forced to pull over. After a half an hour or so, the Border Patrol agents said that Aurora and Rosa Maria could continue onto the hospital, but that they were going to follow them and once the surgery was over, “the girl” would be “processed” for deportation.\n\nTrue to their word, they trailed the vehicle for the remaining 80 miles to Corpus Christi. Once at the hospital, armed male agents followed Rosa Maria’s every move, including staying in the room while nurses checked her weight and vital signs. They stood outside the open door while Rosa Maria waited to be taken into the operating room. After she woke up, technically discharged by the hospital but still resting in her bed, they arrested her.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection then transferred Rosa Maria into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) as an “unaccompanied child.” ORR has detained her in a facility in San Antonio, more than 150 miles away from her family members. ORR is refusing to release Rosa Maria despite public outcry and serious concerns that the facility is unequipped to address her medical and psychological needs.\n\nCall the Office of Refugee Resettlement\n\nBy arresting Rosa Maria and refusing to reunite her with her family, CBP and ORR are not just inflicting cruel and unnecessary trauma on a child -- they are breaking laws on multiple fronts and violating the Constitution.\n\nStrike 1: Border Patrol had no authority to put Rosa Maria into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has no authority to detain her.\n\nThe William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 allows CBP to transfer “unaccompanied children” into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which in turn, derives the authority to detain “unaccompanied children” from the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\n\nThe law defines “unaccompanied” children as children who don’t have a parent or guardian available to care for them in the United States. But Rosa Maria has never been “unaccompanied.” Rosa Maria has always lived in the care and custody of her parents, who are devoted to her well-being. Her cousin Aurora was by her side and her parents were in Laredo, awaiting their daughter’s return, when the arrest was made. The federal government is not authorized to knowingly and forcibly separate parents from a child when they are available to provide that child with care and physical custody.\n\nStrike 2: Border Patrol made an illegal, warrantless arrest.\n\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, CBP can make warrantless arrests only where there is probable cause of removability and the person is “likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for [her] arrest.” Again, Rosa Maria is a child with a serious disability who was recovering from surgery at the time of her arrest. There was never any risk that she would “escape” before a warrant could be obtained.\n\nStrike 3: Border Patrol ’s action discriminate based on disability.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against any “qualified individual with a disability” by any program or activity conducted by any executive branch agency, which includes both CBP and ORR. Rosa Maria has cerebral palsy, which is a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. By arresting her, failing to make necessary medical accommodations, and depriving her of contact with her family, despite her doctor’s instructions that it was in her best interest to be in the custody of relatives, CBP acted with deliberate indifference to Rosa Maria’s disability. She has suffered and continues to suffer physical injury and emotional distress because of their actions.\n\nStrike 4: ORR is violating federal protections for minors.\n\nORR’s detention of Rosa Maria violates the terms of a 1997 consent decree, known as the Flores decree, which remains in effect to this day. The decree established several procedural protections for children to prevent arbitrary detention, one of which requires that minors are placed in the “least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs…” A further stipulation requires that the government release a minor to the child’s parent unless “the detention of the minor is…required either to secure his or her timely appearance” before the immigration agency or the immigration court, or “to ensure the minor’s safety or that of others.”\n\nStrike 5: Rosa Maria and her family have due process rights and ORR is violating them.\n\nRosa Maria’s ongoing detention violates both her and her parents’ due process rights to family integrity under the Fifth Amendment. This case involves “perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by” the Supreme Court—“the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children.”\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that due process entitles a parent to “a hearing on [her] fitness as a parent before [her] children [are] taken from [her].” Rosa Maria has been in the care and custody of her parents since birth — a fact known to the government before it arrested her and placed her in ORR custody. CBP and ORR have never even suggested that her parents are unfit to care for Rosa Maria; much less provided a hearing to determine their fitness prior to her arrest and detention. Nonetheless, ORR has now put the onus on Rosa Maria’s parents to show that they are adequate custodians for their daughter. But this is precisely backwards; the onus must be on the government to justify its decision to take the child from her parents’ care.\n\nThe Due Process Clause permits civil detention of individuals only where it is reasonably related to the government’s interests in preventing flight risk or protecting the community from danger. Rosa Maria is neither a flight risk nor a danger. She is a 10-year old child with serious medical needs.\n\nTo add insult to Constitutional injury, CBP has asserted that its agents were required to arrest Rosa Maria for deportation. Dan Hetlage, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said, “We don't have the discretion. It's not a traffic ticket. We follow the letter of the law.\" That is a lie. While President Trump has greatly expanded the definition of who is considered an immigration enforcement “priority” under his administration, immigration agents retain the ability to exercise “prosecutorial discretion” when human decency calls for it.\n\nCBP has also made the Orwellian claim that its actions were done for the “welfare of the child.” Rosa Maria has been taken from the only home that she’s ever known. Because of cerebral palsy, she requires constant, specialized care, which her family is in the best position to provide. Even without developmental delays, most 10-year-olds would be unable to comprehend or process how they went to sleep at a hospital and woke up in the custody of the U.S. government. Rosa Maria has repeatedly asked her mother over the phone, “Mom, where are you?”\n\nEvery single day that she remains separated from her family, the nightmare continues.", "source_domain": "www.aclutx.org"}

He notes that patients who have other medical conditions or cognitive dysfunction are also at risk.\n\n“People who have memory problems, elderly patients who may forget – they don’t have a substance use problem, but they may forget that they took their medication, and then they take it again and they accidentally overdose. So, it’s not just for what people would traditionally think of as someone with an opioid use disorder,” he said.\n\n“Anyone who’s on opioids is at some level of risk for an overdose,” Dr. Sprintz cautioned, making the state’s new tool all the more valuable for patients to plan and proactively protect themselves.\n\nStay up to date on opioid news and resources by visiting TMA’s Opioid Crisis Resource Center.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org"}

By 2023, there were 1,157 total opioid overdose deaths overall, and 117 deaths among non-Hispanic Black adults, the new report says.According to lead author Cole Jurecka, a researcher at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus , this report follows a longer examination of House Bill 22-1326 , but with more data and analysis.Introduced by former state legislators Alec Garnett, Brittany Pettersen, and John Cooke, HB 1326 had a contentious path through the General Assembly. After a law passed three years earlier making it a misdemeanor to possess up to four grams of most drugs, HB 1326 was billed as a correction to that law, according to supporters. Many Republican state lawmakers at the time thought the measure didn't go far enough in increasing criminal penalties for fentanyl, while some Democrats were concerned it would just ramp up the war on drugs.The new law's provisions outline harm reduction and substance abuse treatment, but also elevated possession of one to four grams of any drug containing fentanyl from a misdemeanor to a level-four drug felony. That definition is important, as drugs like cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine can also be tainted with fentanyl.There was also a provision in the law requiring the Behavioral Health Administration to hire an independent entity to study the public health effects of the newly increased criminal penalties, with Jurecka and his colleagues getting the call. The first report , released at the beginning of the year, found no reduction in overdose death rates associated with the law's enactment. It also noted that \"criminal penalties were perceived by participants as misguided in contrast to other approaches to stemming drug overdoses, including expanding access to medication, other treatment services, and criminal legal diversion options.\"The new report, with more data and more sources of data, concludes that the increased penalties did not change the preexisting trends for opioid overdose deaths in Colorado, and may have contributed to an increase in overdose deaths among the state's Black population.\"We cannot attribute any causal effect to the bill on fatal overdoses,\" Jurecka says. \"We can say: this bill, one of the stated goals is to reduce overdose deaths. It did not do that, but there are a bunch of contributing factors to understand why it didn't do that, outside of just the bill.\"José Esquibel is the director of the Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention, based at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science. The Consortium has existed since 2013, and has been primarily responsible for coordinating the statewide response to the opioid crisis. Esquibel says opioid overdose deaths across the country, including in Colorado, were down in 2024, but the crisis is still on the upswing.\"When you take the 2020 overdose death and you cut out 2021, 2022, and 2023, and put it next to 2024, we're still seeing an increase,\" Esquibel explains. \"Science has shown that harsher criminal penalties do not make significant changes in drug use patterns.\"Esquibel says drug use patterns are driven by cartels, which prey on drug users with the strategy of supply, addiction and demand. So if the science is clear that harsher criminal penalties don't work, why were they included in the bill?\"It's this reaction that people have,\" he says. \"People are desperate, people lose loved ones and get really frustrated about this increase in deaths, and they're reaching for anything. One of the reactions is, let's just keep penalizing people for using drugs and hope this is going to scare people.\"Medications like naloxone, which can reduce overdoses, and methadone and buprenorphine — FDA-approved medications that can help people stop or reduce their opioid use — are underused in the population most affected by overdose deaths, Esquibel argues. He points out that access to those medications has been sparse in Aurora on the east side of the Denver metro, which has the highest Black population. According to Esquibel, he and his organization have been \"banding together with leaders of the Black community to look at ways to increase access to treatment, access to Naloxone (which can reverse overdoses), and access to recovery.\"Lisa Raville, executive director of the Harm Reduction Action Center, is a little more blunt in her criticism of HB 1326.\"We call it a trash piece of legislation,\" she says of the law. \"[The report is a] reminder that they will never treatment or incarcerate their way out of an unregulated drug supply — ever.

Although the opioid crisis and the increasing prevalence of comorbidities have been described as epidemics, they are currently being addressed as separate public health issues. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring residents are provided with interprofessional care to reduce the burden of comorbidities, which can negatively impact their OUD recovery. Their RC should be routinely assessed and enhanced to support their recovery and improve HRQOL.\n\nResults: Most participants were 35 years/older (50.7%), male (58.9%), non-Hispanic White (68.4%), heterosexual (82.8%), and reported HRQOL problems, mainly anxiety/depression (78.4%) and pain/discomfort (55.7%). Participants who were 35 years/older [mean (SD) = 42.6 (7.3)] were more likely to report mobility and pain/discomfort problems than younger participants. Female participants were more likely to report pain/discomfort problems than male participants. Sexual minorities were more likely to report anxiety/depression problems than heterosexual participants. Married participants and those in committed relationships were more likely to report problems conducting self-care than single/never-married participants. Comorbid conditions were associated with mobility, pain/discomfort, and usual activities problems. Most participants reported high social (65.4%), personal (69.0%), and total (65.6%) RC. Low personal RC was associated with mobility (aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.24–0.76), self-care (aOR = 0.13, CI = 0.04–0.41), usual activities (aOR = 0.25, CI = 0.11–0.57), pain/discomfort (aOR = 0.37, CI = 0.20–0.68), and anxiety/depression (aOR = 0.33, CI = 0.15–0.73) problems. Low total RC was associated with problems conducting self-care (aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.07–0.60), usual activities (aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.22–0.83), pain/discomfort problems (aOR = 0.55, CI = 0.34–0.90), and anxiety/depression (aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.10–0.41) problems. Social RC was not associated with HRQOL.\n\nMethods: Project HOMES is an ongoing longitudinal study implemented in 14 recovery homes in Texas. This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from 358 participants’ on HRQOL (five EQ-5D-5L dimensions—mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and RC (Assessment of Recovery Capital scores) collected from April 2021 to June 2023. Statistical analyses were conducted using T-, Chi-squared, and Fisher’s exact tests.\n\nBackground: Recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) includes improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and is supported by recovery capital (RC). Little is known about RC and HRQOL among recovery residents taking medication for OUD. We described HRQOL and RC and identified predictors of HRQOL.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nSubstance use disorders (SUDs), including opioid use disorder (OUD), negatively impact the quality of life (QOL), physical, mental, and emotional states, and social interactions of individuals who use substances (1). The opioid epidemic in the United States (US) is worsening, with over 9 million individuals misusing opioids and 5.6 million individuals having an OUD in 2021 (2). Over 91,000 drug overdose deaths were reported in 2020, an increase of 31% from 2019, and nearly 75% of all overdose deaths were attributed to opioids (3). Opioid and stimulant use disorders and drug overdoses in the US were responsible for 15.03 million disability-adjusted life years between March 2020 and February 2022 (4).\n\nThere is an increasing interest in QOL for decision-making, especially for economic evaluations, and as an essential outcome in clinical care and SUD recovery (1, 5, 6), particularly as perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a stronger predictor of mortality and morbidity than objective assessments of health (7, 8). Individuals with current or past OUD have significant reductions in HRQOL (9). Individuals with SUDs seeking treatment have persistently lower HRQOL than those without SUDs (1). Positive changes in HRQOL among individuals with OUD are associated with recovery outcomes, including improvements in stable housing and decreases in illicit drug use (10).\n\nRisk factors for OUD and opioid overdose deaths involving prescription and non-medical opioid use include mental and physical comorbidities and a history of SUD (11, 12). The prevalence of comorbid mental disorders is higher in adults with OUD compared to the general population (12, 13), with depression and anxiety being the most prevalent and associated with poorer HRQOL (14–17). Similarly, asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease related to opioid-related hospitalization, followed by obesity, liver disease, arthritis, cancer, and stroke (18). Patients with these chronic diseases often experience chronic pain (18) and significant reductions in their HRQOL (19–23). About 20.4% of U.S adults were living with chronic pain in 2016 (24), with researchers finding that individuals who reported chronic pain have problems conducting daily activities, mobility restrictions, worse health status, disability, and increased mortality risk (25–28).\n\nIndividuals who engage in the non-medical use of opioids frequently engage in polysubstance use, complicating the diagnosis and treatment of SUDs and accounting for most opioid-related overdose deaths (29). Most individuals engaging in polysubstance use have lower HRQOL (30) and develop comorbid SUDs (12). For instance, among individuals with an opioid (heroin) use disorder, about a quarter have an alcohol use disorder, more than 20% have a cocaine use disorder, and 12.3% have a marijuana use disorder (12). Other predictors of HRQOL among individuals with SUDs include sociodemographic characteristics, e.g., younger age, male gender, Caucasian race, marital status, employment, and higher educational qualifications, which positively correlate with higher HRQOL dimensions (1, 31–35).\n\nRecovery from OUD is a multidimensional concept that includes improvements in mental and physical health and overall functioning following abstinence (36). Many individuals with OUD have poorer HRQOL than non-users (9, 37). Most literature on HRQOL emphasizes the impact of chronic diseases on an individual’s health and well-being rather than identifying predictors of HRQoL and resources that could support recovery from OUD and improve HRQoL (37, 38). Such research could help health planners, policymakers, and recovery resident operators plan and implement more effective recovery programs for OUD. This is critical as recovery from OUD is supported by medication for OUD (MOUD) and an individual’s ability to use resources for abstinence initiation and maintenance (39). However, despite the effectiveness of MOUD in treating OUD, decreasing illicit substance use, and improving retention in care, uptake remains low (40).\n\nRecovery capital (RC) describes the entirety of resources individuals can use to support their recovery initiation and maintenance (39). RC comprises five resources: social, personal, physical, community, and cultural (41). However, social and personal RC may be stronger predictors of long-term recovery, with high social RC regulating the impact of low personal RC (42). Social RC is the benefits obtained from social networks and relationships that support recovery, including social support and social expectancies (41, 42). Personal RC is defined as individual characteristics, including self-efficacy, education/vocational skills, and mental and physical health (41, 42). Social and personal RC can be continually amassed or depleted over time as an individual’s opioid use or recovery impacts their personal and social functioning (43). Understanding RC in research and practice is critical, particularly as the more RC an individual possesses, the higher their perceived QOL may be.\n\nThe World Health Organization QOL (WHOQOL) dimensions are associated with social and personal RC among emerging adults in substance use treatment (43) and total RC in treatment and recovery samples (6). RC improves QOL by 22% among individuals with an SUD (44). High social RC is associated with greater QOL and enhanced health outcomes (43, 45). Personal RC, such as abstinence self-efficacy, is associated with greater QOL (46). Although research on RC and HRQOL among individuals with SUDs is growing, more attention needs to be paid to RC and HRQOL among individuals with OUD living in recovery homes. This study aimed to describe RC and HRQOL across five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and identify predictors of the health dimensions among a sample of recovery residents taking MOUD. Specifically, we aimed to answer two research questions: (1) do participants differ in their RC and HRQOL levels when entering the recovery homes for OUD recovery support? (2) what are the predictors of HRQOL?\n\n2 Methods\n\n2.1 Design\n\nProject HOMES (Housing for Opioid Medication-Assisted Recovery Expanded Services) is an ongoing longitudinal study of 14 level II (monitored homes, staffed with a paid house manager) and III (supervised homes, staffed with a paid house manager, Director/Administrator, and certified peer support) recovery homes (47) for persons in recovery for OUD and residing in five Texas cities. Eligibility includes a primary diagnosis of OUD, taking MOUD or willing to take before move-in, 18+ years, English or Spanish speaking, able and willing to consent, and agree to sign the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant releases. Trained data collectors obtained written informed consent. Data analyzed were collected from April 2021 through June 2023. Ethical approval was granted by the institutional review board of the authors’ home institution. Participants received a $25 gift card for their time.\n\n2.2 Measures\n\n2.2.1 Sociodemographic characteristics\n\nParticipants were asked about their age, race/ethnicity, sex at birth, sexual orientation, education, employment, and marital status (48). To ensure adequate statistical power in the regression models, dichotomous variables for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White and racial/ethnic minorities) and employment (employed and unemployed) were created.\n\n2.2.2 HRQOL dimensions\n\nHealth-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was measured using the EQ-5D-5L instrument, which consists of a descriptive system that assesses participants’ self-rated health state in five dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression (49). Participants indicate their functioning level in a given dimension. Each dimension has five response levels of severity - no problem (1), slight problem (2), moderate problem (3), severe problem (4), and extreme problem (5) (see Table 1). The EQ-5D-5L responses were dichotomized as no problems and any problems (slight, moderate, severe, and extreme) to change the health states into frequencies of reported problems (49). Responses were also combined to generate health state profiles ranging from full health (11111) to worst health (55555). Each value for a health state was linked to a value set, i.e., index values (weights) for the US. The HRQOL index values range from −0.281 to 1, with negative values representing health states worse than death, 0 representing a health state equivalent to death, and 1 representing full health (49). Sample α = 1.000.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTable 1. Self-reported 5Q-5D-5L problems by recovery capital.\n\n2.2.3 Polydrug use\n\nParticipants were asked about their illicit drug use or misuse in the past 90 days (48). The most frequently reported drugs used were street opioids (55.0%), followed by amphetamines (45.3%), methamphetamines (42.2%), benzodiazepines (38.8%), marijuana (37.5%), prescription opioids (26.0%), and cocaine (24.3%) (Supplementary Table S1). Participants were categorized as engaging in polydrug use based on the number of reported drugs used in the past 90 days.\n\n2.2.4 Hazardous drinking\n\nHazardous drinking was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (50). The AUDIT measures the frequency of drinking, typical quantity, frequency of heavy drinking, impaired control over drinking, increased salience over drinking, morning drinking, guilt after drinking, blackouts, alcohol-related injuries, and others’ concerns about drinking in the past year. Participants with scores of 8 or above were categorized as having a high risk for hazardous drinking (sample α = 0.879).\n\n2.2.5 Comorbid diagnoses\n\nParticipants were asked about 36 comorbid diseases, including depression, anxiety, cancer, arthritis, stroke, and diabetes. Participants were categorized as having comorbid diagnoses or not based on the number of reported comorbid diagnoses.\n\n2.2.6 Recovery capital\n\nThe Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) is a 50-item, dichotomous (0 = disagree, 1 = agree) scale used to assess participants’ RC across two domains (6). Each domain has five dimensions. The social RC domain includes substance use and sobriety, citizenship and community involvement, social support, meaningful activities, and housing and safety. The personal RC domain has global psychological and physical health, risk-taking, coping and life functioning, and recovery experience. Participants were asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with each statement. The sum scores were calculated to create scores for social and personal ARC ranging from 0 to 25 and a total ARC score ranging from 0 to 50. Using cutoff points described in Obekpa et al. (51), ARC scores were dichotomized as low or high social, personal, and total RC (sample α: total = 0.852, social = 0.713, and personal = 0.768).\n\n2.3 Statistical analysis\n\nStudy variables were summarized using descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation (SD), frequencies, and percentages). EQ-5D-5L dimensions were compared by participant’s characteristics and ARC scores using T-, Chi-square, or Fisher’s exact tests. Variables significant at p < 0.1 were entered into multivariable logistic regression models to explore their relationships with each EQ-5D-5L dimension. Results of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were computed using Stata/MP 16 (52).\n\n3 Results\n\nThe mean age in our sample was 36.0 (SD = 8.9). Most participants were 35 years or older (50.7%; mean age = 42.6, SD = 7.3), non-Hispanic White (68.4%), heterosexual (82.8%), male (58.9%), single or never married (62.1%), unemployed (66.0%; 5.4% were unemployed, disabled), attended some college or had a college degree (50.1%), and engaged in polydrug use in the past 30 days (75.5%). Only 8.7% had a high risk for hazardous drinking. The mean scores for social, personal, and total RC were 21.36 (SD = 3.50), 21.39 (SD = 3.60), and 42.75 (SD = 6.63), respectively (Table 2). The mean score for the mobility dimension was 1.28 (SD = 0.67), self-care 1.08 (SD = 0.37), usual activities 2.01 (SD = 1.15), pain/discomfort 2.01 (SD = 1.15), and anxiety/depression 2.46 (SD = 1.16).\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics of EQ-5D-5L scores and ARC scores.\n\nTable 1 describes the five levels of self-reported 5Q-5D-5L problems by RC. Most participants with high social RC reported no problems in the mobility (84.0%), self-care (95.7%), usual activities (89.2%), and pain/discomfort (50.0%) dimensions, while 31.0% reported feeling slightly anxious/depressed, and 30.6% reported no anxiety/depression. Most participants with high personal RC reported no problems in the mobility (86.9%), self-care (98.0%), usual activities (91.8%), and pain/discomfort (53.9%) dimensions, while 32.6% reported feeling slightly anxious/depressed and 31.0% reported no anxiety/depression. Most participants with high total RC reported no mobility (85.5%), self-care (97.0%), usual activities (90.6%), and pain/discomfort (53.0%) problems. 32.5% reported feeling anxious/depressed, and 32.5% reported feeling slightly anxious/depressed.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the most frequently reported EQ-5D-5L health states and their index values by total ARC scores. Participants self-assigned 83 EQ-5D-5L health states out of a possible 3,125 health states. The most frequent 15 states (11111, 11112, 11113, 11122, 11133, 11123, 11121, 11132, 11124, 21132, 11114, 11131, 11134, 11143, and 11135) accounted for 74.1% of participants. Only 58 participants (16.3%) self-assigned health state 11111, i.e., full health, meaning no problem on any HRQOL dimension. Our sample’s overall mean EQ-5D-5L index was 0.79 (SD = 0.16). Table 4 summarizes univariate and bivariate associations between participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, substance use, comorbidities, RC, and EQ-5D-5L dimensions. Overall, the highest proportion of participants reporting any problem was in the anxiety/depression dimension (78.4%), followed by pain/discomfort (55.7%), mobility (19.3%), usual activities (15.5%), and self-care (6.8%). Most participants had high social (65.4%), personal (69.0%), and total (65.6%) RC.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nTable 3. Frequently reported EQ-5D-5L health states by total recovery capital (overall index = 0.790; SD = 0.16).\n\nTABLE 4\n\nTable 4. Participant’s characteristics and ARC scores by EQ-5D-5L health dimensions (n = 358).\n\n3.1 Mobility problems\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were age, race/ethnicity, employment, marital status, comorbid diagnoses, MOUD duration, and personal and total RC. Most participants with mobility problems had high total RC (51.6%), while half had high personal RC. Multivariable logistic regression analyses of EQ-5D-5L dimension by participant factors are summarized in Table 5. Age 35+ years (Model 1: aOR = 2.11, CI = 1.13–3.95; Model 2: aOR = 2.07, CI = 1.141–3.85), comorbid diagnoses (Model 1: aOR = 2.23, CI = 1.04–4.78, Model 2: aOR = 2.20, CI = 1.04–4.69), and low personal RC (Model 1: aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.24–0.76) were associated with mobility problems. There were no significant associations between mobility problems and social and total RC.\n\nTABLE 5\n\nTable 5. Covariate adjusted multivariable logistic regression to predict any problems in each EQ-5D-5L health state by ARC scores and participants’ characteristics.\n\n3.2 Self-care problems\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were employment, marital status, and personal and total RC. Most participants who reported problems conducting self-care had low personal (73.7%) and total (68.4%) RC. In Table 5, marital status- married/common-law marriage/committed relationship (Model 3: aOR = 4.16, CI = 1.14–15.19; Model 4: aOR = 4.57, CI = 1.27–16.41), low personal RC (Model 3: aOR = 0.13, CI = 0.04–0.41), and total RC (Model 4: aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.07–0.60) were associated with problems conducting self-care. There was no significant association between social RC and self-care problems.\n\n3.3 Usual activities problems\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were age, employment, marital status, hazardous drinking, polydrug use, comorbid diagnoses, MOUD duration, and social, personal, and total RC. In Table 5, most participants who reported problems conducting usual activities had high social RC (67.4%) and low personal (58.3%) and total (56.3%) RC. Comorbid diagnosis (Model 5: aOR = 2.61, CI = 1.02–6.66, Model 6: aOR = 2.54, CI = 1.01–6.40) and low personal (Model 5: aOR = 0.25, CI = 0.11–0.57) and total (Model 6: aOR = 0.43, CI = 0.22–0.83) RC were associated with problems conducting usual activities. There was no significant association between social RC and the usual activities dimension.\n\n3.4 Pain/discomfort dimension\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were age, sex at birth, employment, hazardous drinking, polydrug use, comorbid diagnoses, and social, personal, and total RC. Most participants who reported pain/discomfort problems had high social (61.4%), personal (59.8%), and total (57.7%) RC. In Table 5, age 35 + years (Model 7: aOR = 1.58, CI = 1.00–2.51), female sex (Model 7: aOR = 1.77, CI = 1.09–2.88; Model 8: aOR = 1.79, CI = 1.11–2.90), comorbid diagnoses (Model 7: aOR = 2.33, CI = 1.39–3.91, Model 8: aOR = 2.26, CI = 1.36–3.77), and low personal (Model 7: aOR = 0.37, CI = 0.20–0.68) and total (Model 8: aOR = 0.55, CI = 0.34–0.90) were associated with pain/discomfort problems. There were no significant associations between social RC and pain/discomfort problems.\n\n3.5 Anxiety/depression dimension\n\nIn Table 4, significant bivariate associations were sexual orientation, employment, hazardous drinking, polydrug use, and social, personal, and total RC. Most participants who reported anxiety/depression problems had high social (59.9%), personal (62.8%), and total (58.4%) RC. In Table 5, sexual minority orientation (Model 9: aOR = 2.72, CI = 1.19–6.22; Model 10: aOR = 2.49, CI = 1.09–5.70) and low personal (Model 9: aOR = 0.33, CI = 0.15–0.73) and total (Model 10: aOR = 0.20, CI = 0.10–0.41) RC were associated with anxiety/depression problems. There were no significant associations between social RC and anxiety/depression problems. Hazardous drinking was excluded from the regression models due to the small cell size.\n\n4 Discussion\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between RC and EQ-5D-5L HRQOL, described as frequencies of reported problems across five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), among recovery residents taking MOUD in the United States. Our findings add new evidence to the growing literature on RC and HRQOL among recovery residents with OUD. We identified the health dimensions most affected by OUD and comorbid health conditions, summarized the frequency of problems across each dimension, measured the levels of RC and HRQOL problems, examined their associations, and identified strong predictors of poor HRQOL. Our findings can improve our understanding of RC and HRQOL among recovery residents with OUD. With improved understanding, health planners, recovery home administrators/operators, and policy-makers can strengthen recovery residence-based care systems through resource allocation and prioritization.\n\nMost of our study participants self-assigned low HRQOL. Participants 35 years and older were more likely to report mobility and pain/discomfort problems than younger participants. Our findings are concerning because this is a younger sample self-reporting mobility and pain/discomfort problems, contrasting with research that demonstrated mobility problems and chronic pain are common among older adults with OUD (53, 54) and the general population (55, 56), and predictors of SUDs in older adults (57).\n\nOur findings indicate that recovery residents with OUD who report mobility and pain/discomfort problems require special attention for several reasons. First, the most frequently reported comorbidities in our sample were mental health, respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal conditions (Supplementary Table S1), and having either of these comorbidities is associated with mobility problems, pain/discomfort problems, and problems conducting usual activities. Second, individuals with chronic pain, respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal/degenerative diseases are frequently prescribed opioids (55, 58–60), often misuse prescription opioids (61–63), and self-medicate with illicit drugs, resulting in SUDs, including OUD (64, 65). Furthermore, mobility problems are associated with mental illness, including anxiety and depression, increased risk of falls, and cardiovascular and respiratory conditions (66). Finally, the economic cost of pain ($560 billion to $635 billion), OUD ($471 billion), fatal opioid overdose ($550 billion), injury due to fatal ($754 million) and non-fatal ($50 billion) falls, and mental and chronic health conditions, including musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases (an estimated 90% of the United States $4.1 trillion yearly healthcare expenditure), which are attributed to direct healthcare costs, lost wages, impaired QOL, and value of statistical life, cost the United States trillions of dollars, annually (67–71).\n\nRecovery housing provides individuals with SUDs with ongoing support, structure, and life skills building, such as healthy eating and regular exercising, to improve their physical health. Recovery housing-based systems can be leveraged to link residents with interdisciplinary healthcare professionals to provide individualized treatment for their comorbid mental and physical health conditions, including pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical pain management methods. The high rates of self-reported mobility and pain/discomfort problems increase residents’ risks for other comorbid conditions, polysubstance use, and relapse, underscoring the need to screen residents for pain and mobility problems and continuously monitor polysubstance use and safety to prevent opioid-related overdose deaths. Also, recovery housing staff should be trained to assess residents’ functional limitations.\n\nWe found that female residents were more likely to report pain/discomfort problems than male residents, consistent with research that demonstrated pain prevalence and severity appear higher among women (72, 73). Although the precise underlying mechanisms that drive this disparity in pain level are obscure, it has been proposed that interrelated biological and psychosocial factors may contribute to these disparities (73–79). For instance, sex differences might exist in how the opioid receptors are activated in response to pain. Further, men and women are differently socialized to talk about and cope with painful experiences, including adverse childhood experiences. Thus, when compared to men, women will more often employ a diverse set of coping strategies, including relying on social support, while men typically use behavioral distraction or problem-focused approaches (77, 80). There are potential advantages in providing comprehensive, integrated care models that do not place the blame on female residents experiencing pain. Rather, interventions might be needed to support recovery residences’ staff to link female residents to trauma-informed outpatient treatment programs and other services, including social support and mutual aid groups, which are central to improving substance use outcomes (81, 82). While sex differences existed in our sample only on the pain/discomfort dimension, other differences may exist. Future research with larger samples should explore sex differences across all HRQOL dimensions.\n\nParticipants who are married or in a committed relationship were more likely to report problems conducting self-care than single or never-married participants, contrary to previous research that reported married individuals have better HRQOL and health than single, divorced/separated, or bereaved individuals (83–85). This contrasting result may be because residents’ partners also engage in opioid or other substance use, highlighting the need to provide behavioral couples therapy to residents and their married or cohabiting partners.\n\nThe highest proportion of participants reporting any HRQOL problem was in the anxiety/depression dimension. Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur with OUD and are risk factors for opioid misuse and OUD (15, 17). We also found that sexual minorities were more likely to report anxiety/depression problems than heterosexuals, consistent with previous researchers’ findings that indicate sexual minorities have poorer HRQOL, and gay/bisexual men are more likely to report anxiety/depression problems than heterosexuals (86). Given that sexual minorities report worse health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, poor HRQOL, and health-related behaviors, than heterosexuals due to stigma and discrimination (86–88), culturally competent co-occurring mental health and SUDs treatment and support must be integrated into recovery residence-based systems of care.\n\nMost participants had high total, social, and personal RC, consistent with research that reported individuals with higher RC are more likely to identify and access substance use treatment than those with lower RC (89). Low personal RC was associated with problems in all HRQOL dimensions. Similarly, low total RC was associated with HRQOL problems, except mobility problems. Personal RC includes mental and physical health and education/vocational skills (41, 42). Indeed, most participants had attended some college or had a vocational/technical diploma or college degree and reported comorbid mental and physical diagnoses, which may account for the differences in HRQOL by personal RC observed. The presence of comorbid mental and physical conditions may be due to OUD or exacerbated by OUD, which decreases HRQOL (12). Future research should identify and assess the effects of all types of personal RC on HRQOL so recovery staff will better understand how to strengthen residents’ RC to support their recovery and improve their HRQOL.\n\nThe logistic regression model suggests that social RC is not associated with any HRQOL dimension. Our finding is novel compared to previous researchers that reported significant associations between social RC and HRQOL (43, 45, 90). White and Cloud (42) suggest that long-term recovery is predicted by social and personal RC, with the impact of low personal RC being regulated by high social RC. Contrarily, using HRQOL as a proxy for long-term recovery, personal RC is a stronger predictor of long-term recovery, and high personal RC appears to regulate the impact of low social RC in our sample. Nonetheless, recovery homes can provide a safe and supportive environment for residents with low social RC to connect with their peers to improve their health, well-being, and recovery from OUD. This is critical as social capital, such as social support and connectedness obtained from social networks and supportive relationships, are protective against substance use, anxiety, and depression (41, 42, 91–93).\n\nOur results should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations. First, our analysis has a cross-sectional design, limiting our ability to assess causal relationships. Second, most participants were non-Hispanic White and resided in levels II and III certified recovery homes across five cities in Texas. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to other individuals with OUD. Furthermore, our analysis of RC and HRQOL relied on self-reported data, which may introduce social desirability and recall bias. Also, with a larger sample size, potentially meaningful differences that were not statistically significant in our sample might have been identified, e.g., sex differences across all HRQOL dimensions and not just the pain/discomfort dimension alone. Finally, the ARC scale assesses only two of the five RC domains; thus, total RC in our study refers to only the social and personal resources that residents can draw upon to initiate and sustain their recovery from OUD. Nonetheless, personal RC is the stronger predictor of HRQOL and long-term recovery among recovery residents with OUD.\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nOur analysis of data from individuals taking MOUD and residing in levels II and III recovery homes indicates that most residents have high RC. However, personal RC is a stronger predictor of HRQOL than social RC. Our findings underscore the importance of examining each RC domain and increasing RC to influence the HRQOL of individuals with OUD. We also found that comorbid conditions, including mental illness, respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular diseases, are highly prevalent and negatively impact HRQOL. Our results emphasize the need for policymakers to support the integration of MOUD and treatment for comorbid conditions, especially mental illness and chronic physical health conditions that result in pain, mobility issues, and problems conducting usual activities. Recovery is multidimensional and lifelong; thus, researchers and recovery residence administrators/staff should be trained to identify and understand RC and its influences on HRQOL to strengthen residents’ existing or develop new RC. Recovery providers can support residents’ recovery to improve opioid use outcomes and HRQOL by participating in intervention design, interprofessional models of care, and policies. This study adds to the HRQOL and RC literature by identifying the most frequently reported problems in five EQ-5D-5L HRQOL dimensions and predictors of poor HRQOL, i.e., female sex, sexual minority identity, married status, comorbid conditions, and low recovery capital, among recovery residents with OUD.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS).

Here’s what you should know.", "published_at": "2018-04-19T00:00:00", "full_text": "It’s easy to hide. It’s addictive. It’s the new, viral trend to hit schools and part of what the FDA has declared a teen vaping epidemic across the country. What is juuling?\n\nJuul is a type of electronic cigarette – one of the more popular brands – and inhaling it is known as “juuling.” The maker of Juul has claimed that is intended for adult use only. However, due to its design, small size (easily concealable from teachers and parents) and flavors such as mint, crème brulee and mango, it has become appealing to adolescents, says Joseph Rosen, MD, pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist at The Woman’s Hospital of Texas in Houston.\n\n“E-cigarettes are now the most commonly used tobacco products among youth,” Dr. Rosen said, “and Juul, specifically, is the number one selling e-cigarette as of January 2018.”\n\nSo, what do parents need to know? Dr. Rosen, who has co-authored two chapters on smoking and adolescents, explains.\n\nWhat makes the Juul unique?\n\nMost e-cigarettes are cylindrical, whereas the Juul looks like a USB flash drive. It can be charged by plugging it into a USB port on a laptop in the same way that a phone can be charged. Also, it does not have the distinctive smell of cigarettes, so it is more difficult for adults to detect when teens are juuling.\n\nWhere can it be purchased?\n\nJuul is an electronic nicotine delivery system. It can be purchased from any place that sells e-cigarettes or tobacco products. Also, it can be purchased online. The Juul online website requires at least some age verification, but third-party sellers may get around it. More expensive than traditional cigarettes or other e-cigarettes, a kit can run between 20 to 55 dollars. This may discourage some adolescents from using it.\n\nWhat is the purpose of e-cigarettes?\n\nFor the Juul, specifically, the creators claim that it is intended as an alternative to smoking cigarettes, not a method to stop smoking.\n\nDo e-cigarettes help people quit smoking?\n\nThere are mixed results on the research showing e-cigarettes ability to help adults quit smoking. There is no good evidence to show that e-cigarettes help adolescents quit smoking.\n\nWhat are the health risks of juuling?\n\nJuuling contains nicotine and that is extremely addictive. According to Juul, one pod contains about as much nicotine as one pack of cigarettes. A recent study revealed that the use of e-cigarettes by high school students doubled the risk for chronic bronchitis symptoms. Also, “popcorn lung”, a medical condition formally known as bronchiolitis obliterans, may develop in e-cigarette users due to a chemical called diacetyl(1). That causative agent is used in more than 75 percent of e-cigarettes to produce flavors such as maple, coconut, vanilla or others. According to Juul, they do not add diacetyl and acetylproprionyl (or 2,3-pentanedione) as flavoring ingredients. That said, the ingredient list of the e-liquid formula used in Juul is not available to the public.\n\nIs juuling safer than smoking traditional cigarettes?\n\nIt took many decades to firmly demonstrate the dangers of cigarette smoking. There has not been adequate time to do these studies for e-cigarettes, which are relatively new. I am not aware of any studies comparing Juuling to smoking cigarettes. However, two new studies on e-cigarettes showed they contain cancer-causing chemicals and are associated with future cigarette smoking in teens.\n\nWhat do parents need to know about juuling?\n\nIn 2015, 37.7 percent of high school students had tried e-cigarettes and the use of e-cigarettes has been going up since then. Many youth who use e-cigarettes are unlikely to have initiated tobacco smoking with cigarettes. So, e-cigarettes are expanding overall use of tobacco products among youth, rather than replacing other sources. Most importantly, e-cigarettes (including Juul) are not a safe alternative to smoking. E-cigarettes should not be used for treatment of tobacco dependence in teens, as they have not been shown to be safe or effective.\n\nWhat advice would you give parents about juuling?\n\nBecause children whose parents do not smoke or who successfully quit smoking are much less likely to take up smoking, I strongly encourage parents to quit. It makes sense that the same would go for e-cigarettes. I encourage parents to:\n\nmaintain a smoke-free and e-cigarette-free (including Juuling) home,\n\ngive clear and consistent messages to their children that they expect them to remain non-smokers and “non-vapers/non-Juulers,”\n\nwork on fostering resistance to social influences from peers by rehearsing refusal skills (Teaching of the mnemonic REAL (Refuse, Explain, Avoid, Leave) has been successful as part of a school-based substance prevention curriculum.),\n\ntalk to their children about the negative effects of smoking and e-cigarettes as young as 5 years old.\n\nDr. Joseph Rosen is a pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist at The Woman’s Hospital of Texas, an affiliate of HCA Healthcare, and serves as Director of Sleep Medicine for Houston Pediatric Pulmonary and Sleep Associates.\n\nHCA Healthcare 50th Anniversary\n\nIn 1968, HCA Healthcare was conceived by two physicians and an accomplished business leader — Dr. Thomas Frist Sr., Dr. Thomas Frist Jr., and Jack Massey.

Settlements were reached nationwide with opioid distributors to resolve claims by state and local governments that these companies contributed to the opioid epidemic.\n\nAurora will receive millions over the next several years, and the plan is to use that money to help mitigate the effects of the opioid crisis. Region 9 Opioid Abatement Council is working to identify the best way to use those funds.\n\nCommunity Medical Services in Aurora CBS\n\n\"We are looking at funding things such as education awareness for the youth and for adults. We're also looking to fund walk-in crisis centers, detox facilities, and peer counselors. We know we have a shortage of people in that profession, so trying to offer additional training with the dollars that we have to maybe help someone wanting to be in that career,\" said Councilmember Francoise Bergan, who's also chair of the Region 9 Opioid Abatement Council for Arapahoe County.\n\nBergan joined Councilmember Steve Sundberg and Mayor Mike Coffman for a tour of Community Medical Services in Aurora. They heard directly from community members in recovery.\n\n\"By bringing them here, we get to open that conversation up and help them amplify their stories. That way, it can be factored into policy that affects everyone,\" said Chloe Wells, Community Impact Manager for CMS.\n\nCMS takes a holistic approach to treatment, offering the latest medications for opioid use disorder, counseling and support services. They offer methadone, a medication-assisted treatment not used at every clinic.\n\nSince opening, they've already treated 2,000 patients. CMS opened in a part of the city they knew needed support.\n\n\"It's imperative that folks can receive services in their home community. The first step in identifying a location is trying to understand what services already exist. If there aren't treatment services nearby. We also take in consideration transportation, so proximity to public transportation, such as the light rail. Being here has opened the door for folks who maybe otherwise would not have traveled across Aurora to engage with services,\" said Wells. \"There are people who are hurting, who don't know where to get help or don't know how to get help, or they're facing the stigma. They're afraid to open that door. We found that regardless of how many clinics are in a certain area, there's always someone else who needs it.\"\n\nCBS\n\nCMS does boots-on-the-ground outreach, like visiting people in encampments.

He says fighting the opioid battle takes community education and making treatment more accessible.\n\n\"I had been using from 17 until about 29. And 29 is when I found out methadone exists,\" said Torres. \"I am on Medicaid, so I don't have to pay for the methadone. Also, I get rides to and from the clinic since I don't have a car.\"\n\nTorres says the medication is only part of his success - recovery takes a village.\n\n\"Addiction is a part of every socio-economic group. It's people from all classes, all races, all genders, everything. Addiction does not look like one person. It's a lot of different people. That's why it's important to have a support group.

Beginning on that date, social media platforms would be required to display pop-up notifications that inform Colorado users under 18 about the potential harms to their mental and physical health from prolonged periods spent on social media. This message would appear after one hour of use each day, or if the user is on the platform between 10pm and 6am, and would reappear every 30 minutes.\n\nIn a poll commissioned by Healthier Colorado that was fielded in May and June of this year, 90% of Colorado voters said that social media had a “negative impact on the mental health of youth in Colorado.” The same overwhelming majority also agreed with the statement that “There is a growing mental health crisis facing children and youth in Colorado.” When provided with a description of HB24-1136, 69% of Colorado voters indicated that they supported this new law.\n\nIn response to the NetChoice lawsuit, Jake Williams, CEO of Healthier Colorado, issued the following statement:\n\n“Our kids have been treated as guinea pigs in a profit-driven experiment by big tech. The results are in: social media use poses serious risks to youth mental health. These findings are confirmed by leaked documents from social media companies themselves, as well as the U.S. Surgeon General. The least we can do to protect our children is to let them know about these risks, which is what this law does. This common-sense approach empowers kids and families to make informed decisions, without imposing any restrictions on what content they consume. Social media companies are not entitled to unfettered access to our kids’ brains. We will fight back against these companies to support Colorado families.”\n\nRep. Rose Pugliese (R-Colorado Springs), a sponsor of HB24-1136 who also serves as Minority Leader for the House Republicans, stated: “As a parent, I know the challenge of raising children in the age of social media. What we as parents are seeing firsthand has also been confirmed by research: social media use is harmful for youth mental health and can lead to things like anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Parents cannot tackle these challenges on our own, and that’s why this law is so important. This is a common-sense, family-focused law that provides young people and their parents with the knowledge and support they need to make informed decisions about safe social media usage.”\n\nSen. Judy Amabile (D-Boulder), another sponsor of the law, added: “The longer teens spend doom scrolling on social media, the higher their chances of experiencing anxiety, depression, and emotional distress. Coloradans recognize that social media presents a growing public health problem for our youth, and they want their leaders to take action. Similar to the warnings we already place on many other consumer products, it’s time we help teens make informed choices by providing them with the evidence-based information as well as the support and guidance they deserve to use social media safely.”\n\nHealthier Colorado is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to raising the voices of Coloradans in the public policy process to improve the health of our state’s residents. We believe that every Coloradan should have a fair chance at living a healthy life.\n\nMary Kate Morr is Director of Communications for Healthier Colorado.", "source_domain": "pagosadailypost.com"}

It’s 2022 and we still see problems,” said Jennifer Sharpe Potter, PhD, MPH, the study senior author. Dr. Potter is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, executive director of Be Well Texas, and vice president for research at UT Health San Antonio.\n\n“Unfortunately, our data are consistent with reports using other methods that suggest lack of certified prescribers is a national problem,” Dr. Potter said.\n\nThe Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000 made it possible for health care workers to obtain an “X-waiver” to prescribe buprenorphine. To be eligible, physicians needed to complete eight hours of qualified training before prescribing buprenorphine, and advanced practice providers including physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners needed to complete 24 hours of training.\n\nUT Health San Antonio researchers sent surveys to more than 600 clinicians who attended X-waiver training courses offered statewide between March 2019 and February 2020. The team received responses from 126 clinicians, including 81 physicians, 37 nurse practitioners and eight physician assistants.\n\nAmong the 126 respondents, less than half (61) had received an X-waiver after attending the waiver training. Of those, almost two dozen were prescribing buprenorphine. Only 17% of survey respondents (22 of 126) were prescribing the lifesaving medication after attending the X-waiver training. This study contributes new evidence that X-waiver training is only part of the puzzle when it comes to understanding the barriers that clinicians must overcome to begin prescribing buprenorphine.\n\nPolicy change last year\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published new practice guidelines to reduce the training burden for treating opioid use disorder with buprenorphine. According to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website, the revised guidelines “exempt eligible practitioners from certification requirements related to training and the provision of psychosocial services, which were previously necessary when dispensing or prescribing buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD to 30 or fewer patients.”\n\nMore than relief of training burden is needed\n\nDr. Potter and the team believe more than this exemption is needed to expand access to best practices in OUD care. Obstacles to adoption cited by survey respondents included, “Complexity of the X-waiver process,” “Perceived lack of professional support and referral network,” and “Getting started with prescribing buprenorphine.”\n\n“The failure to treat OUD is part of the reason that we have the current rate of overdose deaths,” Dr. Potter said. “At a time of unprecedented opioid-related overdose deaths, there is now relief from the training burden of obtaining the X-waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, a medication that reduces the risk of overdose by 50%.”\n\nA demonstrated need\n\nNearly 1,900 opioid overdose deaths were documented in Texas in 2020, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. In the JAMA Network Open paper, the authors cited sources that stated:\n\nTexas has the highest number of people in the country living outside of a 10-mile radius from a waivered clinician.\n\nTexas is among the top three states with the most individuals with OUD and the lowest number of X-waivered clinicians.\n\nThe GetWaiveredTX Program, a Texas Health and Human Services-funded initiative, trained more than 700 Texas-based clinicians as qualified buprenorphine prescribers.\n\n“If we are going to address the epidemic levels of overdose from drugs in the United States, we need to implement a comprehensive approach that includes making it easier for clinicians to treat OUD and reduce the burdens on providing this level of care,” Dr. Potter said.\n\n“We can’t just provide relief from the waiver,” she added. “We must provide support so that clinicians know how to incorporate this into their practices in a way that is feasible for them.”\n\nSurvey of Barriers and Facilitators to Prescribing Buprenorphine and Clinician Perceptions on the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 Waiver\n\nHolly J.

It is open to everybody.\n\n“We are doing rock climbing and paddle boarding in the harbour or on the beach and, through Solstice, it is equine therapy.”\n\nDr Farquhar added: “It takes people out of their comfort zone, putting them in a situation where they are forced to act in a situation they are not used to being in and then using that as a tool to help them to understand their own personality and way of approaching things.\n\n“It is also about problem solving and putting people in anxiety provoking situations and helping them to control that and de-escalate their anxiety.\n\n“In a climbing situation it is obvious what the source of the fear is but in someone who has an anxiety disorder they may feel anxious without there being an obvious provocation so it’s about putting them in a situation where not only have they got the anxiety but there is an obvious source for it, so it’s about using that as a tool to help them to recognise it and to manage it.”\n\nDr Farquhar, who has more 20 years of clinical experience in psychiatry, has worked in a variety of areas, including prisons, hospitals, outpatient clinics and in the community.\n\nDr Laura Henagulph, clinical psychologist at Atlantis, which is based on Hamilton’s Reid Street, said: “In Bermuda where stigma exists, people often suffer with very frightening symptoms which they keep secret.\n\n“If they don’t tell anyone about them and these things worsen and it ends up with them having to go into tertiary care — bypassing primary and secondary services.\n\n“The Mid Atlantic Wellness Institute is a fantastic service but when you are very, very ill and you have lost touch with reality, the admission process itself can be very traumatic.\n\n“I guess what we might want to do is to encourage everybody to seek help earlier so it doesn’t get to the point where they have to go straight to tertiary care.”\n\nDr Henagulph, a specialist in individual therapy for attachment disorders and relationship difficulties, has worked with organisations including the Department of Child and Family Services and the Department of Corrections.\n\nShe also has experience as an expert witness in criminal and civil courts.\n\nDr Henagulph said: “We would encourage anyone experiencing distressing symptoms to come forward and talk to someone about it no matter how shaming it seems.\n\n“Our mission at Atlantis is to break down the stigma around the more severe end of mental illness — severe interpersonal issues — because there are treatments available and people do get better.\n\n“If you need help in that area it is imperative you go to an expert and you can start working on some of those issues before they start becoming severe or you start feeling isolated. It can become a terrible cycle where people just shut down.”\n\nAtlantis has expertise in cognitive disorders and serious mental illness as well as personality disorders, neuro-developmental disorders and drug and alcohol misuse.\n\nIt also offers liaison services and advice to its clients, including clinical and court reports, forensic risk assessment and management and treatment strategies.\n\nFor more information about Atlantis visit www.atlantis.bm or call 533-3325 or 533-3326", "source_domain": "www.royalgazette.com"}

That’s down slightly from 311 the prior year.\n\nThe medical examiner’s office was able to determine the cause of death for 216 people who died in Denver. Among those, 68% died from overdose — and most of those overdoses, 75% of them, were due to fentanyl. That’s 115 deaths attributed to fentanyl out of 153 overdose deaths.\n\nOverdose deaths had increased by 18% in 2023, but plateaued this year, dropping 0.6%. It was the first year since 2017 that overdose deaths did not rise.\n\nThe homicide rate among people who are homelesshas declined the past two years — down 4.4% this year and 5.4% last year. Deaths by suicide, meanwhile, accounted for almost 5% of all deaths this year, compared with about 2% last year.\n\nRisk factors for suicide, including mental illness, drug and alcohol use, and isolation, are associated with homelessness.\n\nThe Coalition for the Homeless plans to remember those who died at an annual vigil Saturday, which is the longest night of the year. It’s the 35th annual event in which people who work to provide shelter, food and health care to the homeless throughout the year gather at the steps of the Denver City and County Building, surrounded by luminaries, to read the names of those who died. The public is invited to attend and encouraged to bring donations of new adult coats, socks and gloves.\n\n“It is important to honor individuals and report on their deaths in the greatest detail possible because this may be the only acknowledgement some receive,” the coalition wrote in its report.\n\nThe average age of death for a person who was homeless this year in Denver was 46. That’s below the 2022 average of 50.5 and far below the average U.S. life expectancy of 77.5.\n\nFor those who went from homelessness to housing in one of the coalition’s apartment buildings, the average age of death jumped 13 years, to age 59. Housing also had a profound effect on the overall death rate and the number of people who died by overdose. Among those who died while living in coalition housing, 17.2% died of overdose, compared with 68% of those who were homeless.\n\nOverdose deaths among people who are homeless across the nation have slowed in recent years. After rising steadily for two decades, overdose deaths decreased 17% nationally from July 2023 to July 2024. Still, this equates to about 100,000 overdose deaths this year.\n\n“These losses are catastrophic, unacceptable and largely preventable,” the coalition wrote.\n\nThe nonprofit advocated for expanded access to treatment, including more syringe exchange programs. The coalition supports a Denver City Council proposal that would loosen restrictions on the number of needle exchange sites, which is currently capped at three, and a requirement that they are at least 1,000 feet from schools or day care centers. The sites provide naloxone, which can revive people who have overdosed, as well as test strips to check drugs for fentanyl.\n\nThe coalition provides medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction in Denver and runs a treatment program at Fort Lyon, a former Army fort outside of Las Animas in southeastern Colorado. The coalition added 215 apartments this year, and converted a nine-story hotel and convention center in Globeville into a supportive housing residence called Renewal Village.", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com"}

One of the oldest and most effective is medication-assisted treatment (MAT).\n\nAlso frequently called medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), MAT is a proven treatment approved of by all major medical organizations, including the Texas Medical Association. It has faced stigma and misunderstanding, even among many health care professionals. But physician experts in addiction say it is a key tool in combating substance use disorder, especially for opioids.\n\nWhat is MAT or MOUD?\n\nMAT is the use of medications and counseling to treat people with substance use disorder. People addicted to alcohol and tobacco can benefit from MAT. But historically, the approach has been used to treat opioid use disorder treatment, so MAT is commonly referred to as MOUD, says Austin addiction psychiatrist Carlos Tirado, MD, a member of TMA’s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health. The medications used are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Their use is coupled with counseling to help the patient deal with the psychological aspects of substance use disorder.\n\nIs MAT, or MOUD, effective?\n\nYes. Several studies show that compared to no treatment or treatments not involving medications, MOUD decreases risk of drug-related death and suicide by over 50%. The three medications used – methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone – are consistently associated with improved health outcomes, including reductions in opioid use and transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. MAT is similarly effective in treating alcohol use disorder, and smokers who receive a combination of behavioral treatment and cessation medications quit at higher rates than those who receive minimal intervention, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n“We know this is the standard of care for opioid use disorder,” said Ann Marie Case, MD, an Austin addiction specialist. “We’ve known that since the 1970s and we’ve known that it works.”\n\nAnd since physicians no longer must obtain an X waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, physicians who are not addiction specialists can more easily offer MOUD to patients, she says.\n\nWhy is there stigma about MAT?\n\nPerhaps the most common misconception about MAT is the patient is switching one addiction for another.\n\n“That’s a huge component of the stigma that I see among my colleagues when I get phone calls or get asked to consult,” Dr. Case said.\n\nHowever, that belief is not founded in truth. These medications normalize brain chemistry, block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids, relieve physiological cravings, and normalize body functions without the negative and euphoric effects of the substance used, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nLike any medication, those used in MAT can be misused. But in the overwhelming number of cases, it’s not, Dr. Tirado says. And the stigma against medication assistance for opioid use disorder, in particular, means that at least 87% of people who need this treatment are not getting it, according to a recent study.\n\n“Most of my patients know there’s a treatment from what they’ve heard on the street from other people, not from a health care professional,” Dr. Case added.\n\nHow important is the counseling aspect for MAT?\n\nJust like other chronic conditions, substance use disorder requires that medication be coupled with other types of treatment to maximize its effect, Dr. Tirado says. In the case of MAT, that other treatment is counseling, which helps people learn how to resist drug use and build healthier relationships.\n\n“Psychosocial interventions, addressing comorbidities – be they physical or psychiatric – those are all part of what we call a plan of sustained recovery,” he said. “It does require a comprehensive approach.”\n\nHere are several physician resources for MAT and MOUD:", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org"}

In the United States alone, almost 108,000 people died from drug overdose in 2022, and about 75% of those deaths involved opioids.\n\nAlthough many factors contribute to this crisis—and there are many approaches to addressing it as a result—one important line of research is into the genetic factors that increase people’s risk for developing an opioid use disorder (OUD). Once these risk factors are known, doctors may be able to prescribe opioids more strategically to people at higher risk of OUD, and such individuals could make more informed choices.\n\nIn recently published research, scientists from the University of Colorado Boulder—including Eamonn Duffy, Jack Ward, Luanne Hale, Kyle Brown and Ryan Bachtell of the Bachtell Laboratory, and Andrew Kwilasz, Erika Mehrhoff, Laura Saba and Marissa Ehringer—tested the influence of genetics on opioid-related behaviors, which include OUD. Specifically, they looked at its heritability by conducting an experiment in which rats were given the ability to self-administer oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid that is used medically to treat pain.\n\nCU Boulder researchers tested the influence of genetics on opioid-related behaviors, specifically looking at its heritability by conducting an experiment in which rats were given the ability to self-administer oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid that is used medically to treat pain. (Photo: Jon Anders Wiken/Dreamstime.com)\n\nExperimental design\n\nMore than 260 inbred rats from 15 strains were used for the study. In this case, an inbred strain is defined as a population produced by 20 or more generations of brother-sister mating. This was important for the study because the rats within inbred strain are isogenic: “They’re almost like clones; their genomes are identical, except for the X and Y chromosomes between males and females,” Duffy explains.\n\nLike the use of identical-twin research involving humans, this makes the results more reliable. In a twin study, most differences between twins are caused by their environment, so researchers can determine the genetic influence on a trait by how much it varies. Similarly, within an inbred strain, most individual differences are caused by sex differences, and this provides insight into the importance of biological sex to a given trait. Between inbred strains, differences are attributable to either the strains’ different genes, sex differences, or a combination of the two.\n\nThe animals in the study could self-administer the oxycodone using levers, so their behaviors could be measured. There were two retractable levers in the testing chamber: one active, which would give the rats a dose of oxycodone after being pulled, and one inactive, which would do nothing.\n\nAfter the active lever was pulled, there was a cooldown period of 20 seconds, during which time pulling the lever would not dispense another dose. Regardless of whether pulling a lever had an effect, it would be recorded. This allowed researchers to measure two substance-use behaviors in addition to the total amount of oxycodone consumed. These variables were referred to as “timeout responding” and “lever discrimination.”\n\nTimeout responses were pulls on the active lever that happened during the cooldown period. Lever discrimination was a measure of how often rats pulled the inactive lever. Both essentially tracked the rats’ ability to self-administer substances in a regulated manner, although lever discrimination could have other associations. Attempting to get more oxycodone very quickly (timeout responding) and attempting to get it in an illogical way (low lever discrimination, especially once the animals had time to learn how the levers worked) are signs of dysregulated drug use.\n\nThese measures are important in addition to total dosage because the rats naturally consumed more oxycodone as they developed a tolerance to the drug, making it difficult to characterize their drug use on that basis alone. “With addiction,” Duffy says, “it’s a complicated story. They’re developing tolerance, and they’re showing dysregulated use.”\n\nPush the lever, get the oxycodone\n\nThe tests were split into two phases: acquisition and escalation. Although the number of daily doses the rats received generally increased over time, especially between the two phases, their self-administration behaviors varied significantly by strain.\n\nFor example, in the escalation phase, the females of one strain pushed the lever for a total oxycodone dose of less than 100 mg/kg, whereas rats of another strain took a total of about 300. There was also variation between males and females within a strain, though not always: In some strains, males and females consumed a similar amount of oxycodone, while in others, consumption was notably divergent, with males consuming around 200 mg/kg more oxycodone overall.\n\nOnce the genetic factors that increase people's risk for developing an opioid use disorder (OUD) are known, doctors may be able to prescribe opioids more strategically to people at higher risk of OUD, and such individuals could make more informed choices. (Photo illustration: iStock)\n\nThis is evidence for a strain-sex interaction, meaning that the rats’ substance-use behaviors were determined by a combination of genetic background and biological sex, not either alone, according to the researchers. Although the obvious explanation for this would be different genes encoded on the sex chromosomes of the various strains, this isn’t necessarily the case.\n\n“Some of our collaborators in San Diego have performed several genetic mapping studies,” Duffy says, “and they found that the Y chromosome didn’t appear to play much of a role in regulating behavioral traits.”\n\nIt is possible that X-chromosome genes are a greater factor. However, the biggest influence would probably be sex hormones or related differences, Duffy adds. For example, according a separate study, the sex hormone estradiol can increase oxycodone metabolism indirectly by raising the concentration of a protein in the brain.\n\nMoreover, Duffy says, “there could be developmental aspects to the sex difference, so seeing if they’re exposed to testosterone versus estrogen as they’re growing up, that may affect how their brain is wired.”\n\nSeveral other strains showed notably divergent behaviors. Some strains were fairly stable in their use, while others increased their oxycodone intake rapidly during the acquisition phase. Lever discrimination also varied by strain, with one strain increasing its lever discrimination quickly, for example, while another failed to increase its lever discrimination much over time.\n\nThe biggest discovery that emerged from the research was the discovery of how heritable several behaviors related to opioid use are.\n\nThe influence of genetics\n\nHeritability is a measure of what part of the variation in a group is due to genetic or heritable characteristics.\n\n“With heritability,” Duffy explains, “when you’re looking at everything that goes into some kind of trait, like opioid use disorder, the average genetic component will be your heritability. You also have environmental influences, which could be things such as diet.”\n\nTaking OUC as an example, variation might be understood qualitatively in terms of how destructive the effects of drug use are on individuals, from having minimal effect on people’s lives to potentially causing overdoses and death, Duffy adds.\n\nIf the heritability of OUD were 0, the fact that some people use the drug safely and others die because of it would be explained entirely by non-genetic factors. If the heritability of OUD were 1, this fact would be explained entirely by genetics. However, as with most traits, OUD appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nAccording to the study, measures of oxycodone intake ranged between 0.26 and 0.54 heritability. The high end of this range is total oxycodone intake over the course of the experiment, while the low end is change in intake (increase in intake over the acquisition phase). The other behavioral phenotypes had heritability scores of 0.25 to 0.42, with timeout responding being more heritable than lever discrimination.\n\n“About half of that variability is due to genetic background,” Duffy says, referring to total intake. “That’s really strong heritability.” However, because these data come from rats, the heritability of these behavioral phenotypes may be different in humans. “We’re not going to capture everything about OUD in a rat model, but we can capture specific aspects and use that to put together a bigger picture.\n\n“OUD is hard to study in humans because there aren’t as many people using opioids as alcohol or nicotine, and of that smaller population, we also have people using several types of drugs, so it’s harder to calculate these heritability values, but I believe ours do fall within the range for opioid dependence and opioid use disorder in humans.”\n\n“With addiction, it’s a complicated story. They’re developing tolerance, and they’re showing dysregulated use.”\n\nIt's also important to recognize that heritability is a population-level statistic. This means that it does not represent the chance for any individual to develop a trait, even if that trait could be inherited from the individual’s parents. However, a higher heritability of some trait would correspond to a greater resemblance between parents and offspring in that respect throughout the population, Duffy says.\n\nWhat genes contribute to OUD?\n\nWhile it is useful to know how heritable opioid use disorder is, meaningfully assessing the risk for individuals requires knowing what genes contribute to it. This study doesn’t identify these genes, but progress has already been made to this end.\n\n“There’ve been a number of studies in humans that have found that these SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, are associated with your risk of developing conditions like opioid dependence or opioid use disorder,” Duffy says. “There’s another group that is performing some genetic mapping in outbred rats, and that’s going to be the next stage of this project for us as well.”\n\nOne potential gene influencing OUD in mice is an SNP in the Oprm1 gene, which is explained in the study to affect the brain’s response to reward-related behavior generally and analgesics like oxycodone specifically. Common Oprm1 SNPs have also been associated with dysregulated use of an opioid in humans, specifically heroin.\n\nOnce relevant SNPs are identified, however, the situation remains complex. “It’s not going to be a simple answer,” Duffy says. “Like, you have this one SNP in Oprm1 and that’s going to increase or influence your risk for OUD. It’s probably going to be a multitude of SNPs, and those additive effects are going to influence the risk for this disorder.”\n\nDid you enjoy this article? Subscribe to our newsletter.

Clinicians strive to avert these boarding outcomes by expanding access to mental health support through innovative strategies, Funda Bachini, MD, division chief of psychiatry at Phoenix Children’s, told Becker’s.\n\nPhoenix Children’s serves more than 278,000 patients annually. Its behavioral health sector offers services from outpatient counseling to inpatient care.\n\n“There are really long wait times in the community to see a psychiatrist, waiting on average six months, which is really hard,” Dr. Bachini said. “If you’re at the point where you’ve reached out to a psychiatrist, you need help now, or else you wouldn’t be reaching out.”\n\nFollowing the pandemic, Phoenix Children’s stationed psychiatric nurse practitioners in its emergency departments, allowing assessments and treatment — including medication — for children waiting for psychiatric services. At one time, there were nearly 24 children waiting for services, according to Dr. Bachini.\n\n“The need definitely outweighs the supply of providers,” she said. “That’s a national trend. We see that locally in Arizona, but it happens everywhere.”\n\nMental health therapists were also put in place so patients with psychiatric and mental health needs are seen within two hours of entering the department. The hospital has created programs across the spectrum of mental health services to address the influx of children entering emergency departments.\n\nMany treatment options include either the highest level of care — including inpatient — or outpatient services that may have a six-month waitlist.\n\nThe hospital has developed a bridge clinic that helps patients after discharge from the emergency room, psychiatric services and Suicide Prevention Program team to connect with a Phoenix Children’s health provider while plans for long-term care are formed. This “bridge” allows patients to meet with providers as needed — which is daily in some cases — and decreases the number of former bridge clinic patients returning to the emergency department.\n\n“Sometimes when you come to the emergency department, you don’t need to go inpatient, but you also can’t wait that amount of time,” Dr. Bachini said. “The bridge clinic [has] therapists and psychiatrists who can see you within one to two days and then see you at increased frequency, so you don’t have to sit around and wait in the ER and you have some sort of intervention.”", "source_domain": "www.beckersbehavioralhealth.com"}

The Pharmacy Access to Resources and Medication for Opioid Use Disorder Guideline, released today, addresses critical barriers in the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder across the nation’s community pharmacies.\n\nWith approximately 2.7 million individuals in the U.S. affected by OUD, the need for effective management strategies has never been more urgent. The PhARM-OUD Guideline marks a significant advancement as the first consensus, evidence-based practice guideline specifically tailored for community pharmacists, equipping them with essential tools to enhance patient care.\n\n“Not all pharmacies stock medication for opioid use disorder, this new practice guideline will change that,” said Tyler Varisco, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health outcomes and policy at UH and principal investigator of the project.\n\n“By addressing the unique administrative and regulatory challenges they face, we aim to empower pharmacists to confidently dispense buprenorphine and provide effective care for those living with OUD,” Varisco said.\n\nThe PhARM-OUD Guideline provides nine major recommendations and 35 additional strategies designed to eliminate confusion and fear surrounding the dispensing of buprenorphine, a lifesaving medication for the treatment of OUD.\n\nIt specifies key actions: Reducing stigma associated with dispensing buprenorphine\n\nImproving pharmacists’ understanding of state and federal regulation\n\nEnhancing communication with healthcare providers\n\nThese guidelines are crucial because they not only address the knowledge gaps that have historically hindered pharmacists from providing OUD treatment but also foster an environment where pharmacists can confidently engage in patient-centered care. By equipping pharmacists with the tools and resources they need, the PhARM-OUD Guideline aims to increase the availability of buprenorphine and ultimately improve health outcomes for individuals receiving treatment for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe new practice guideline for pharmacists will allow more life saving drugs like buprenorphine to be dispensed in community pharmacies Tyler Varisco, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health outcomes and policy at UH, spearheaded the project to develop pharmacy guidelines\n\nCurrently, only about half of U.S. pharmacies dispense buprenorphine, despite it being the only medication routinely provided by community pharmacists for OUD treatment.\n\nDeveloped through a collaborative effort with an expert panel that includes psychiatrists, psychiatric pharmacists, and representatives from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the National Community Pharmacists Association, the guideline reflects a comprehensive approach to pharmacy practice for patients with OUD. The American Society of Addiction Medicine, the American Pharmacists Association, the American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists, the American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists, and Vital Strategies, a leading global public health organization, have all indicated their support for the guidance.\n\nThe PhARM-OUD Guideline is available on the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy website.

Kids can have symptoms of anxiety as early as eight years old, and often these symptoms manifest two years before an official diagnosis, according to a 2016 study from Duke University.\n\nKeller said pediatric providers, educational staff, and families need to know how to recognize and identify signs of poor mental health in kids.\n\n“We lack proactive support for mental health to support parents, because these are largely pediatric illnesses,” Keller said. “Parents and caregivers really need to be our focus.”\n\nTo improve pediatric mental health diagnostics and care, Texas launched the Child Psychiatry Access Network (CPAN) in 2020.\n\nCPAN is a hotline for pediatricians and other health providers treating children to consult with mental health experts to identify the best courses of treatment for their patients.\n\nKeller encourages people to start a conversation with a loved one about how they’re feeling and seek help if they’re not sure what to do.\n\n“These are sensitive, difficult issues to talk about, and so have someone help you with that,” he said. “These are medical illnesses.

That’s why the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute is traveling across Texas -- and stopped in Fort Worth this week to hear some powerful stories.\n\nDuring the first 90 days of his tour in Vietnam, Michael Killam says he felt invincible.\n\n“I had weapons,” he said. “I had power over life and death. I could make people live or I could let them die. I became God-like.”\n\nKillam was only 19 at the time. During his tour, he was captured for three days, hung upside down, and tortured for hours. Eventually, he escaped and returned to duty.\n\n“We went to an orphanage that had been mortared,” Killam said. “And we had to get the kids out. I found a little baby. It had something in its chest. I pulled it out and its last breath came out ... and a lady slapped me and called me a baby killer. And I thought for a long time that I killed that baby. And my kids, I had four daughters. I wouldn’t touch them. I thought I’d kill them.”\n\nFor decades, he’s had flashbacks.\n\n“Every time it happened, I’d end up in the back of a police car,” he said. “And when they tried to take me, I’d fight like hell, I thought I was getting captured again.”\n\nArlington Mayor Robert Cluck says he sees too many police vehicles in front of the emergency room.\n\n“We need to decriminalize mental health,” he said. “Just like if you have an appendicitis, we shouldn’t send a police car out to go and pick you up, take care of you.”\n\nCluck is also a doctor, and serves as the vice president for medical affairs at Arlington Memorial Hospital.\n\n“Life is stressful,” he said. “Families are stressful. Jobs are stressful. And it’s that stress level, I think, that really has a very negative impact on us, and I suggest to you, on our length of life, without help.”\n\nThere is help, says Susan Garnett, CEO of Mental Health Mental Retardation Tarrant, known as MHMR. She says Tarrant County has built a robust crisis service system, including one that helps police officers called The Law Liaison program.\n\n“Perhaps they’ve been called out to a scene and they’re trying to determine if this a mental health matter,” she said. “Is the person already known to the mental health system? ... What advice do our staff have for them? Is it the sort of circumstance where our staff need to come out on scene?”\n\nMHMR already has a mobile crisis outreach team that’s available 24 hours a day, to help anyone. Garnett says the police line averaged only 60 calls a month when it started. Today, that number is 800.\n\nArlington’s Police Department recently teamed with MHMR on a new program, says Lt. Kimberly Harris.\n\n“I started pairing the mental health law liaison from Tarrant County MHMR with a patrol officer,” she said. “And they actually went to homes to do wellness checks and to do mental health evaluations for people that were referred to them through other patrol officers.”\n\nArlington now has at least 30 mental health patrol officers.\n\nIt’s reassuring news for Killam, the Vietnam War vet. He now works for MHMR as a program manager in Veterans Services. His story drew a standing ovation this week.\n\n“I don’t do this for applause,” he said. “I do it to help my brothers and sisters. There’s something when a veteran talks, everyone knows it. ”\n\nIn truth, he says, he does it because it makes him feel connected again.", "source_domain": "www.keranews.org"}

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS)4 can be used to estimate trends in ED visits involving underage alcohol misuse. The HCUP NEDS is a nationally representative database of community hospital–based ED visits collected by AHRQ. Data are collected for all visits in participating hospital-based EDs regardless of expected payer or inpatient admission status. For each visit, data are available on selected patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, ED discharge status, primary payer, and total ED and inpatient charges.\n\nUsing the NEDS data from 2010 to 2013, ED visits involving underage alcohol misuse were identified using the age and diagnosis fields. ED visits for patients aged 12 to 20 with one of the following ICD-9-CM codes in any diagnostic or E-code field were included in this analysis: 980.0, 303.00, 303.01, 303.02, 305.00, 305.01, 305.02, 790.3, and E860.0. (Table S1 lists the ICD-9-CM codes used to identify the alcohol misuse–related visits.) These codes, which include alcohol toxicity, alcohol poisoning, and alcohol abuse, were selected to limit the visits that were included in the analysis to cases of acute alcohol poisoning and nondependent abuse among underage patients.5 Visits were then stratified into alcohol-only visits and drug and alcohol combination visits. Underage alcohol misuse–related visits were classified as combination visits if they included at least one drug-related ICD-9-CM code, in any diagnostic position or E-Code field, listed in Table S2. Visits that were missing data on age or gender were excluded from the analysis.\n\nRates of underage alcohol misuse–related ED visits were calculated using age- and gender-specific population estimates of adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 20 from the U.S. Census Bureau. Alcohol misuse–related ED visit rates were calculated for males and females aged 12 to 20 and separately for those aged 12 to 14, 15 to 17, and 18 to 20; all of the reported rates were stratified by gender. Adolescents aged 12 to 17 were stratified into two separate age groups because past research has shown that the patterns of gender differences among those aged 12 to 14 and those aged 15 to 17 are different.1 Alcohol misuse–related ED visits are expressed as the number of ED visits per 100,000 adolescents or young adults by year.\n\nChi-square two sample t-tests were used to test for differences in proportions between alcohol-only visits and drug and alcohol combination visits for demographic characteristics including gender, age group, disposition (treated and released, admitted, other, etc.), and the presence of an injury-related ICD-9-CM diagnosis code recorded on the claim. Separate Poisson regression models were run in samples that were stratified by gender. Poisson regression models with a continuous time variable, a gender variable, and a time by gender interaction term were also used to examine changes in the trends in the rates of alcohol-only and drug and alcohol combination ED visits by time and gender. Trends are described as increasing or decreasing only when the changes over time were statistically significant at the 0.05 level. By examining the combined effects of gender, age, and time on underage alcohol misuse–related ED visits, it will be possible to determine whether the gender trends in underage alcohol misuse–related ED visits are consistent with the changes in drinking behaviors observed in people aged 12 to 20.", "source_domain": "www.samhsa.gov"}

Part 1 provides the current outlook for U.S. high-speed rail and its history to date. Part 3 examines the challenges to creating a national high-speed rail network.\n\nIt was an audacious idea: build a 200-mph passenger rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles unlike anything that has ever existed in the United States. In 2008, California state legislators put Proposition 1A on the ballot, asking voters to approve a $9.95 billion bond issue to get the project started. Largely favored by Democrats and environmental advocates, the project also enjoyed the support of then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. The ballot measure passed with almost 53% of the vote.\n\nBut 16 years later, no one has ridden a high-speed train in California. A 119-mile segment of the 494-mile project is under construction in the state’s Central Valley, an agricultural region. High-speed trains aren’t expected to run there until 2030 at the earliest. Still, that hasn’t stopped others across the U.S. from investing, planning and beginning to build high-speed rail projects.\n\n“The time has come for high-speed rail,” investor Wes Edens told Smart Cities Dive. Edens is the co-founder and CEO of Fortress Investment Group, which backs the Brightline West project to connect Las Vegas and Southern California with 200-mph trains.\n\nAdvocates cite benefits ranging from reduced highway congestion and greenhouse gas emissions to time savings and job creation. “The more time that you save people, the more likely it is for them to take your train,” Edens said. The sweet spot for high-speed rail lines that will entice private investors are city pairs that are “too far to drive and too short to fly,” he said.\n\nTraditional public transit strongholds are not the only places you’ll find government support of high-speed rail today. The states of Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington and Tennessee, along with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, are among the entities actively planning new high-speed rail projects. And Amtrak is evaluating a partnership with Texas Central Partners on a Dallas-Houston line. Here is a look at where these projects stand.\n\nLos Angeles Union Station, which opened in 1939 in the heart of downtown LA, will serve as the terminal for bullet trains from San Francisco if the California High-Speed Rail Authority can find funding to complete the line. Courtesy of California High-Speed Rail Authority\n\nCalifornia’s big idea faces big challenges\n\nThe proposed San Francisco to Los Angeles line, managed since 1996 by the California High-Speed Rail Authority, has a checkered history. Estimated costs have ballooned from $33 billion in 2008 to up to nearly $128 billion in 2024. The authority’s 2008 business plan described a system carrying more than 90 million passengers across an 800-mile network annually by 2030; its latest 2024 business plan now projects 28.4 million riders along a 494-mile network by 2040 — if it can find the money to continue building. “We have some significant financial challenges that are ahead of us,” said Anthony Williams, a member of the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s board of directors and director of public policy for Amazon in California.\n\nCalifornia LA-SF high-speed rail project Comparison of cost, full length and projected ridership in 2008 and 2024.\n\nDelays, cost overruns and management issues came to the fore in a 2018 report from the California state auditor. It faulted the authority for over-reliance on consultants, poor contract management and high turnover among its contract managers. When Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, came into office in 2019, he said in his first state-of-the-state address, “The project, as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long.” He backed away from the aspiration of linking San Francisco, LA, Sacramento and San Diego, committing only to a smaller project in the state’s Central Valley. That’s where construction is underway now, between Bakersfield and Merced, California.\n\n“Historically, doing this kind of thing has never been easy,” said Williams. “We also had some challenges at the beginning about how to get it right.”\n\nThe project became the target of some Republicans in this Congress, who added a provision to the House fiscal year 2025 transportation appropriations bill that would prohibit the project from receiving federal funds.\n\n“Most people in this country, when they think about high-speed rail in the United States, tend to gravitate towards [the California project] because that's the one that's been going on for quite some time,” said Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO’s Transportation Trades Department. “The problem is that how ambitious it is and has been, it's going to draw a target on its own back.”\n\nSupport for the project in Washington has shifted back and forth in the past five years. While the Trump administration tried to kill a previously awarded $929 million federal grant and threatened to claw back $2.5 billion in federal funds from the authority, the Biden administration last year gave it $3.07 billion.\n\nIn recent months, the California High-Speed Rail Authority received environmental clearance for the final segment of the LA-San Francisco line and appointed a new CEO, but Williams admits there are still challenges ahead. Currently available, authorized and expected future funding totals $35.2 billion, enough to finish the first segment. But that leaves a $93 billion gap to meet the estimated cost for a line that runs all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles. “At this time, we do not have a specified timeline for project segments outside the Central Valley, as the necessary funding has not yet been secured,” the authority states in its 2024 draft business plan.\n\nBoth the state and the federal government will have to step up their commitments, Williams said. “We're making a promise about how high-speed rail is going to transform transportation and future economic development, particularly in the Central Valley,” he said.\n\nBrightline founder Wes Edens (fifth from left) and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (right of Edens) join other dignitaries in hammering the first spikes during a groundbreaking ceremony at the site of the future Brightline West station in Las Vegas on April 22, 2024. Ethan Miller via Getty Images\n\nLas Vegas line attracts private investors\n\nWhile the California project has relied entirely on public funds to date, Brightline West is investing its own capital into a $12 billion project between Las Vegas and Southern California. The project has also been awarded up to $3 billion from the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program and will have access to up to $3.5 billion in private activity bonds from the U.S. Department of Transportation. These bonds are tax-exempt, significantly lowering the cost of capital for Brightline West, which must repay them.\n\n“The private sector can provide a significant impetus,” said Edens. “But especially when you're trying to develop the first [high-speed rail line], government support is necessary. And fortunately, we have a government now that believes in that.”\n\nBrightline West began construction in April. Its 218-mile line from Las Vegas to Rancho Cucamonga, California, about 42 miles east of Los Angeles Union Station, will mainly run in the median of Interstate 15, with intermediate stops in Victor Valley and Hesperia, California. At Rancho Cucamonga, it will connect with commuter railroad Metrolink for those continuing on to other Los Angeles-area destinations. Constructing the line along an existing transportation corridor eased the permitting process and allowed the federal environmental review to speed through. Brightline West aims to complete construction in 2028.\n\nEdens sees “many really compelling city pairs around the country” for high-speed rail and said that “there's lots of capital availability” as well as interest among the investment community to participate in these projects. He highlighted the “Texas triangle” — Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin — as one of the most compelling opportunities.\n\nConcerned landowners look over specifics of the proposed route of a high-speed rail line by Texas Central Partners at a public hearing on Jan. 31, 2018, in Fairfield, Texas. Amtrak has now taken the lead on this project. Dug Begley/Houston Chronicle/AP\n\nTexas may be next\n\nA project to connect Dallas and Houston with a high-speed rail line dates back at least 10 years. It saw little progress this decade until Amtrak got involved last year. In an interview with Smart Cities Dive, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called the Texas Central project “one of the most promising proposals.”\n\nAmtrak and Texas Central announced in August 2023 that they were evaluating a potential partnership to move the project forward. A year later, Andy Byford, Amtrak’s senior vice president of high-speed rail development programs, announced at the Southwestern Rail Conference that Amtrak is taking the lead on the project, and an Amtrak spokesperson said at the time that the rail company is conducting due diligence. The partnership is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, and Amtrak declined to make Byford available for an interview for this story.\n\n“With Amtrak entering the scene on this, it gives new life to it,” said Peter LeCody, president and chair of Texas Rail Advocates, a nonprofit advocate for high-speed rail in Texas. LeCody said Amtrak has moved the project to the third and final step of the Federal Railroad Administration’s Corridor Identification and Development Program. The program, authorized under the 2021 infrastructure law, helps guide intercity passenger rail development throughout the country. Step 3 enables the project to begin preliminary engineering and environmental work, some of which has been done. According to LeCody, Amtrak is conducting “very extensive conversations with everyone along this route, from North Texas down to Galveston.”\n\nHigh-speed rail projects in the United States Projects at least partially funded for planning, design, engineering and/or construction.\n\nFour more projects in planning around the country\n\nAmtrak received a federal grant of up to $500,000 to help plan the Texas Central project. Four other projects also received up to $500,000 planning grants last year under the FRA’s Corridor Identification and Development Program:\n\nThe North Central Texas Council of Governments is proposing a high-speed rail line between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, a short ride that would allow residents west of Dallas to easily connect with the proposed Texas Central line to Houston.\n\nIn California, the High Desert Corridor project seeks to link the future Brightline West line to the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s San Francisco-LA line in Southern California. It also has state and local funding.\n\nThe states of Washington and Oregon, along with the Canadian province of British Columbia, are exploring high-speed rail connecting Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation is spearheading a plan to build high-speed rail connecting Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nCongress has granted appropriations for two other projects: a proposed Atlanta to Chattanooga, Tennessee, line, led by the Tennessee Department of Transportation in conjunction with the Georgia DOT, and an Atlanta-Savannah, Georgia, line.\n\nSome advocates envision a national network of high-speed rail. “A true high-speed rail network would be enormously beneficial for our economy and for our climate,” Buttigieg said. “It would even be beneficial for our roads because it would reduce the congestion on them.”\n\nBut funds for these ambitious projects can be hard to come by, and U.S. political leaders’ attitude toward high-speed rail could determine their future.", "source_domain": "www.smartcitiesdive.com"}

They said they wanted his expertise on how federal health programs could improve care for people with substance use disorders.\n\n“When I got the email, I forwarded it to colleagues, and I said, ‘I don’t think this is real.’ I have published some on Medicaid policy as it relates to treatment for opioid use disorder, and I actively practice in this area. But I’m very junior, and so I literally thought it was a joke,” Christine says. “One of my mentors said, ‘That looks real. You should respond.’ ”\n\nSoon it got even more real. A Zoom meeting with the congressional staffers to discuss the issue was followed by an invitation to come to Washington, D.C., to testify before a Senate subcommittee.\n\n“I asked them directly, ‘Why me?’ And they were very supportive. They told me they liked the way I was able to draw connections between the very big policy issues and the way they directly impact care for my patients. They appreciated having clinical insights into how policy influences practice.”\n\nEight days to prepare\n\nChristine, an assistant professor in the Division of General Internal Medicine, found himself sitting before a panel of senators recently, testifying with other experts at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on Health Care titled “Closing Gaps in the Care Continuum: Opportunities to Improve Substance Use Disorder Care in the Federal Health Programs.” Among the senators at the hearing that day was U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado.\n\n→ Video: Watch the U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing on substance use disorder\n\nChristine had only eight days to prepare his written and oral testimony after getting the invitation. “I had to put everything else on hold,” he says. “I was like, ‘OK, this is my full-time job for the next week.”\n\nDespite his junior status, Christine brought extensive research and clinical experience with him to the nation’s capital.\n\nHe is a board-certified addiction medicine specialist who practices at Denver Health’s Sam Sandos Westside Family Health Center, where he works as part of a multidisciplinary team to provide comprehensive treatment for individuals with substance use disorders. His research focuses on evaluating health and social policies that affect the availability of high-quality care for people with substance use disorders, particularly for those enrolled in Medicaid and other safety-net programs. He also delves into testing innovative approaches to improve addiction care.\n\nChristine says he is passionate about researching and promoting policies that improve health care equity and outcomes for substance use disorder patients. In April he co-authored an opinion column in The Colorado Sun, an online news outlet, on how proposed federal legislation would help rural Coloradans get greater access to opioid addiction treatment.\n\nPaul Christine, MD, PhD, testifies before the Senate Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on Health Care in Washington, D.C. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Senate.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe Senate hearing was called amid a serious and growing crisis. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, nearly 108,000 people in the United States died from drug-involved overdoses in 2022, twice as many as in 2015. Of those deaths, 74,000 involved synthetic opioids other than methadone, primarily fentanyl. Opioid use disorder -- chronic use of opioids causing clinically significant distress or impairment – affects more than 2 million Americans.\n\nChristine says there are a couple of key points that he hoped the senators took away from his testimony.\n\n“One is that we should be keeping federal insurance barriers to treatment for addiction as low as possible. There are policies in place within Medicaid and Medicare that put up barriers where they don’t need to be. I talked about prior authorization policies for medications for opioid use disorder. Those policies continue to be enforced in a lot of states, particularly in Medicaid managed care programs, and it’s directly in the federal government’s ability to say, ‘OK, no more of this.’ In fact, Medicare has already done that.”\n\nPaying for what works\n\nThe second key takeaway in his testimony, he says, “is paying for what works. Addiction treatment by its nature is very collaborative and multidisciplinary, and yet a small fraction of what we do is actually reimbursable, and many of the programs that we know work well are entirely grant funded, which is temporary. Take, for instance, peer support services, where people who are in recovery from drug use help current patients navigate the treatment system and social services. We know that there are really effective models of this. And yet, most state Medicaid programs won’t pay for that. And that leaves a lot of patients in the lurch.”\n\nIn his testimony, he cited contingency management for stimulant use disorder as another example of paying for what works. Contingency management is “a structured rewards program for keeping people engaged in treatment. But there are federal limits on how much we can spend that are far below what published research shows are effective levels.”\n\n→ Studying the Connection Between Empathy and Substance Use in Adolescents\n\nOverall, he says, “there needs to be a standardized process through the federal health programs to evaluate the evidence, figure out what works well, and then pay for it.”\n\nChristine says he felt the senators were “very receptive” to his message at the hearing. He noted that his invitation to testify came from staffers from the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, a Democrat, and its ranking Republican, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana.\n\n“Fortunately, around the issues of substance use, there is a decent amount of bipartisanship. People recognize that the overdose crisis is a major issue. It doesn't matter if you're in a right-leaning or left-leaning state. This is impacting everybody, and they seemed to genuinely want to come up with some solutions.”\n\nPhoto at top: Paul Christine, MD, PhD (right) testifies before the Senate Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on Health Care in Washington, D.C.

While we have seen seizure numbers trending lower in other parts of the country, Colorado seems to be consistently at or near record highs for the number of fake pills seized.”\n\nTo date in 2023, RMFD says it has collected nearly 2.7 million fentanyl pills, up from last year’s record-setting 2.61 million pills. Of those roughly 2.7 million, lab testing revealed half contain enough fentanyl to be fatal.\n\n“There’s ... a 50-50 chance you’ll die after taking just one of these pills. It’s a flip of a coin,” Pullen said.\n\nFentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. It’s often found in pills made to look like a legitimate medication, and a user often has no clue how much fentanyl they are really ingesting. Just 2 milligrams of fentanyl -- RMFD says think an amount the size of a pencil tip -- can be deadly.

Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States and is a major cause of serious disability for adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is also preventable and treatable.\n\nSo, what exactly is a stroke? A stroke occurs when part of the brain is cut off from blood and oxygen due to a blood clot or broken blood vessel. In just minutes, strokes can cause lasting brain damage, and delayed treatment increases the risk of permanent disability and death. Knowledge of stroke risk factors and symptoms is crucial to reducing the likelihood of and improving the outcome of a stroke.\n\nThe American Heart Association’s Getting to the Heart of Stroke™ initiative, developed in conjunction with HCA Healthcare — our broader healthcare network — and the HCA Healthcare Foundation, focuses on preventing, treating and beating stroke by:\n\nProviding nationwide consumer and healthcare professional education.\n\nDeepening collaboration between neurology and cardiology.\n\nEquitably empowering communities to improve health outcomes.\n\nWith individualized health education efforts in 15 local communities across the U.S., the initiative highlights the powerful connection between heart and brain health.\n\n“What’s good for the heart is good for the brain, but the reverse is also true: problems with the heart, including AFib, are well-documented as major stroke risk factors,” says Nancy Brown, chief executive officer, American Heart Association. “To effectively combat stroke, we need to work together and elevate the heart-brain connection among health care professionals, while simultaneously addressing health disparities and resource gaps in our communities. We are not a one-size-fits-all nation, and neither is the most successful approach to public health.”\n\nKnow your risk\n\nStroke prevention starts with knowing the risk factors that increase the likelihood of having a stroke. Identifying the underlying cause of a stroke is also crucial to preventing subsequent strokes. Common risk factors include obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, alcohol or drug abuse, or heart disease. If you have any of these risk factors, it is important to discuss them with your doctor to manage and reduce your chance of stroke.\n\nFor example, patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation are up to five times more likely to experience a stroke. The American Heart Association’s patient support network, MyAFibExperience, empowers individuals to better understand and manage their stroke risk.\n\nAs part of the Getting to the Heart of StrokeTM initiative, the American Heart Association will work alongside the HCA Healthcare Foundation and HCA Healthcare to implement community education as well as professional education focused on identifying stroke risk factors projected through the lens of equitable health for all.\n\nWorking closely with thought leaders in healthcare, including those from HCA Healthcare, the American Heart Association will also develop accredited education programming that will be available to all healthcare professionals, and a specific learning collaborative with 10 HCA Healthcare facilities focused on continuously improving the quality of care.\n\n“We are proud to be collaborating with the American Heart Association,” says Dr. Steven Manoukian, HCA Healthcare senior vice president and Fellow of the American Heart Association. “Within both organizations, we recognize that increased education and connectivity between our neurology and cardiology health care teams, patients and communities are integral to reducing the devastation of stroke, determining its underlying cardiac causes, such as AFib and structural heart disease, and preventing future strokes. Through this unique and multi-faceted initiative with the AHA, everyone will become better at Getting to the Heart of Stroke.”\n\nKnow the signs\n\nWhen a stroke occurs, getting treatment fast is crucial to decreasing the long-lasting effects of stroke. The signs of a stroke can be thought of with the acronym, BE FAST. Here are the symptoms that could mean you or your loved one is having a stroke:\n\nBalance or the inability to maintain coordination\n\nEyes or the inability to see out of one or both\n\nFace that is drooping on one side\n\nArms or the inability to raise one or both\n\nSpeech or the inability to repeat a simple sentence\n\nAnd if you or someone around you is experiencing the symptoms above, it is\n\nTime to call 911 and seek emergency care.\n\nHCA Healthcare has a long history of prioritizing and working to continually improve patient safety. This includes reducing our average door-to-needle time to 34 minutes, which is faster than the national standard for stroke care.\n\nShare with your community\n\nIn order to beat stroke, we must decrease stroke for every member of our communities. HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are dedicated to advancing health equity and bettering stroke care in all patient subsets, including all races and ethnicities. Some patient subsets, such as Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations, face additional barriers to identifying and treating stroke risk factors, receiving thorough assessment and finding follow-up stroke care.\n\nGetting to the Heart of StrokeTM addresses health disparities like this through local health impact work and community education in areas including women’s health, high blood pressure management, nutrition security and tobacco/vaping prevention.\n\nYou can make a difference in your community by sharing your knowledge of stroke care and prevention with others. By sharing the resources in this article, along with additional resources provided by the American Heart Association, American Stroke Association and the Getting to the Heart of StrokeTM initiative, with your family and friends who may be at risk for stroke, you can help save lives.\n\nInspiring stories of stroke survivors\n\nAcross HCA Healthcare, we hear countless stories from stroke patients and those who care for them. We know that stroke can happen to anyone at any time. This American Stroke Month, read four powerful stories of stroke survival and learn more about how to recognize stroke and what to do if stroke happens.\n\nFlorida mother shares her stroke story to ensure other young adults are aware of their risk\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Crystal Warp (right) and her mother (left).\n\nHCA Healthcare patient Crystal Warp is a 39-year-old mother of three who, after surviving and recovering from a stroke, is sharing her recent health scare to make sure other young adults are aware of their risk. Crystal’s experience comes as doctors across the country are witnessing a concerning trend – adults under 50 are having more strokes than ever before.\n\nWhen Crystal was recently preparing to attend her weekly quilter’s class, she began experiencing tingling and numbness in her leg, dizziness and a terrible headache. After witnessing Crystal’s speech difficulty and body weakness, Crystal’s mother, Kicha Padmore-Johnson, rushed her to HCA Florida Poinciana Hospital in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nOnce they arrived at the hospital, one of the nurses quickly noticed Crystal’s stroke-like symptoms and rushed her back for an assessment, where doctors discovered a brain bleed. Crystal had suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage, or ICH stroke.\n\nCrystal spent several days in the hospital’s intensive care unit, followed by weeks at HCA Florida Osceola Hospital’s onsite acute inpatient physical rehabilitation center, where she would regain the function of her hands and body with intensive physical and occupational therapy, including a comprehensive rehabilitation program specifically for post-stroke patients.\n\n“The loss of movement after stroke was overwhelming to me. The self-doubt and sadness that came from not being able to go home to my kids, not being able to be there for them like I was before, not being able to craft, which provides for my family – it was devastating,” Crystal said.\n\n“But the nurses and therapists at the hospital were amazing and encouraged me every step of the way. To me, HCA Healthcare is family. I have a forever family in some of the people who took care of me. I’m out of the hospital and they still check on me.” Crystal Warp, HCA Healthcare stroke patient\n\nCrystal is nearly fully recovered more than a month after her stroke. She couldn’t wait to create custom creations from her craft business for each HCA Healthcare colleague who cared for her as a thank you. She recently visited the team to show how she is now able to walk unassisted.\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Crystal Warp (middle) recently returned to HCA Florida Osceola Hospital to say thank you to her caregivers.\n\n“It is not lost on me that when I spend time with my family, play with my kids, and for the first time after my stroke, walk by myself, it is because a family of physicians, nurses, therapists and others that gave me my life back. For that, I am forever grateful.” Crystal Warp, HCA Healthcare stroke patient\n\nTexas hospital honors ‘miracle’ stroke survivor\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Jeremy Simmons received care at HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest in Texas.\n\nA Houston stroke survivor’s recovery is described as a “miracle” by his loved ones and surgeon. Earlier this year, 42-year-old HCA Healthcare patient Jeremy Simmons collapsed and fell unconscious while at his home.\n\nJeremy was rushed to HCA Houston Healthcare North Cypress Hospital after his wife called 9-1-1. There, doctors discovered he had had a stroke, four brain aneurysms and excessive bleeding to the brain. Jeremy was then transported for advanced care to sister facility, HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest.\n\nIn a split second, the lives of Jeremy’s entire family were turned upside down. His wife recalls the most challenging part was maintaining some sense of normalcy for their five-year-old daughter, who had to go 28 days without seeing her dad.\n\nAccording to Dr. Shamaelah Javed, a neuroendovascular surgeon at HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest, Jeremy’s case was unique due to major bleeding occurring at his young age. She said he had a rare malformation affecting only 1 in 600,000 people, and 70% of patients in these cases don’t even make it to the hospital.\n\n“[Jeremy’s recovery] is basically attributed to the kind of care that he got in the hospital along with the treatment we offered,” Dr. Javed told the Houston Chronicle. “This is like a miracle because his chances of walking out of the hospital were very long.”\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke patient Jeremy Simmons hugs his daughter while recovering in the hospital.\n\nDr. Javed said the use of new devices and technology helped throughout the process. “He just came back to see me a couple of weeks ago and he’s doing very well. He’s recovered a lot. So, I think the new treatment modalities that we have has made a huge difference in his recovery.”\n\nFamily members are also integral in the stroke care journey. Jeremy’s wife, Laura, told the Houston Chronicle it is important to seek treatment immediately if you’re experiencing symptoms.\n\n“If there’s something unusual like migraines or numbness to your arms or blurred vision, just don’t waste any time. Get to the doctor immediately,” she said. “And obviously, as anybody knows, you’re your biggest advocate for yourself and your health. Talk as a family. I had no idea that strokes ran in both sides of this family very strongly and I didn’t realize this until he was in the hospital.”\n\nJeremy’s wife acknowledges that their family has a long road ahead of them, but knows he will continue to beat the odds and progress every day. Now on the mend, Jeremy looks forward to spending time with his wife, who was at his bedside every day of his recovery, and his daughter.\n\nRecognizing the signs of a stroke saved a South Carolina man’s life\n\nHCA Healthcare stroke survivor Nate Robinson (left) and the medical director of Trident Medical Center’s Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit Dr. Douglas McGill (right).\n\n“If it weren’t for you, there wouldn’t be a me.” Those words were spoken through tears by HCA Healthcare patient and stroke survivor, Nate Robinson. The 51-year-old credits both his co-worker at Volvo, Shavon Felder, and the care team at Trident Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina, with saving his life.\n\nOn December 21, 2022, Shavon noticed Nate’s speech was slurred when he was talking to her at work. “When he first said my name, it was slurred and I knew it wasn’t right. So, I asked him to repeat it,” explained Felder. “I told him to look at me and noticed his face was looking funny. Then, he told me he thought he was dragging a leg. I said, ‘Oh no, you’re having a stroke’.”\n\nThey quickly called 9-1-1, and Nate was transported to Trident Medical Center for emergency stroke care. The South Carolina hospital was recently ranked among the top 100 Hospitals in America for stroke care in 2023.\n\nAfter receiving speech, occupational and physical therapy at Trident Medical Center’s Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit, Nate’s caregivers held a red carpet celebration to celebrate his recovery. Nate said, “Once your speech, eating and walking have been disturbed you will know how difficult it is to start over again. So, I say to anyone who is listening, don’t take those things for granted. In a moment’s notice, they can be taken from you.”\n\nWalking down the red carpet at the hospital, Nate was able to thank Shavon and his care team, while also spreading smiles by bowing once he reached the end. With a smile and cheers from everyone around, Nate said, “Thank you for giving me my life back.”\n\nTexas patient suffers stroke at 29-years-old\n\nHCA Healthcare patient Daniel Gainer works with his rehabilitation team after suffering a stroke at 29-years-old.\n\nA stroke at the age of 29 was not something HCA Healthcare patient Daniel Gainer ever expected to experience. “This was my first real health problem, and out of nowhere, it just happened,” Daniel told Fox News this American Stroke Month.\n\nDaniel’s wife, Denisha, recalls him complaining of a terrible headache the day after Thanksgiving. They later learned that the headache was a stroke that ultimately led to a brain bleed.\n\nDenisha and Daniel rushed to HCA Houston Healthcare in Houston, Texas, where Daniel faced multiple organ failures.\n\nDaniel’s physician, Dr. Mohammed El-Ghanem, informed his family about the unfavorable odds. With incredible skill and expertise, Dr. El-Ghanem’s team worked to stop the bleeding and reverse the young 29-year-old’s organ failure.\n\nDaniel recently celebrated his 30th birthday – a milestone Daniel said would not have been possible without his care team at HCA Houston Healthcare.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

They had to pass through one of several Border Patrol checkpoints set up in South Texas, north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nGonzalez said Border Patrol agents allowed the girl and her cousin to pass, but followed the hospital vehicle taking them. At the hospital, agents stood by and refused to let Rosa Maria's relative close the door to their room so they could keep watch over the girl, Gonzalez said. And after the surgery was complete, agents stood ready to escort Rosa Maria to a federal facility for unaccompanied minors in the U.S. illegally, located another 140 miles away in San Antonio.\n\nRosa Maria is being held at the facility indefinitely, the attorney said. Even if she is eventually released to a sponsor approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the girl will undergo processing and could be deported. Gonzalez said it could be several weeks before she is released.\n\n\"They just refused to allow the child to go home,\" Gonzalez said Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed its agents had escorted Rosa Maria from a checkpoint to the hospital. It said Border Patrol agents were \"committed to enforcing the immigration laws of this nation.\" The statement added that \"once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly.\"\n\nHHS, which oversees facilities for unaccompanied minors in the U.S. illegally, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a San Antonio Democrat, blamed the Trump administration for adopting \"callous policies\" toward immigrants.\n\n\"They're treating her like a hardened convict,\" Castro said.\n\nGonzalez said Rosa Maria has \"difficulty understanding exactly what's taking place\" and is closer in development to a child that's 4 or 5 years old. Her parents are both in the United States illegally and came with Rosa Maria to the U.S. in 2007, when the girl was a newborn, in part to seek better medical treatment for her cerebral palsy. They sent Rosa Maria with a cousin to the hospital because the cousin is a U.S. citizen and could pass through the checkpoint.\n\nThe case is reminiscent of a September incident in which a man and woman in the U.S. illegally were followed by Border Patrol to the same Corpus Christi hospital when their newborn child needed surgery.\n\nAstrid Dominguez, immigration policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said people without legal status in Texas' border regions have long had to decide whether to seek medical care and face detention, including during the Obama administration.\n\n\"This isn't an isolated case,\" Dominiguez said. \"This is a risk they have to take to get medical attention for their children.\"\n\nReport a typo to the ABC13 staff", "source_domain": "abc13.com"}

Called “Crush the Crisis,” the event aligns with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.\n\nLast year’s events in October 2020 collected 13,523 pounds of unused and expired medications. This year, approximately 96 HCA Healthcare facilities at 99 event locations across 17 states will invite community members to safely and anonymously dispose of unused or expired medications.\n\n“Opioid addiction is a national health crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified the issue,” said Dr. Randy Fagin, chief medical officer of HCA Healthcare’s National Group. “A significant number of opioid addictions and deaths come from individuals accessing unused opioid prescriptions from family and friends. Our ‘Crush the Crisis’ events help communities across the country properly dispose of these medications while educating the public about the serious threat of opioid misuse.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 70,630 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2019, with more than 70% attributed to opioids. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the U.S. has seen an increase in opioid usage with all 50 states reporting a spike or increase in overdose deaths since the pandemic began. To support the development of safer pain management protocols and seek reversal of the opioid crisis, HCA Healthcare proudly partners with and brings vast clinical insight to the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) Action Collaborative on Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic and has committed $750,000 to the Collaborative.\n\nAs a learning health system, HCA Healthcare uses data from approximately 32 million annual patient encounters to help continuously improve care. The organization uses the science of “big data” to reduce opioid misuse and transform pain management, with initiatives in surgical, emergency and other care settings, including:\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR): a multi-modal approach to pain management that has demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and a reduction in the use of opioids. HCA Healthcare data from more than 86,000 joint replacement, gynecologic oncology, colorectal and bariatric surgeries using ESR in 2020 revealed an up to 26% reduction in opioid usage compared to those surgeries without the use of ESR. As of August 2021, ESR is live at 168 HCA Healthcare facilities, with the goal to make ESR the standard of care for all service lines.\n\nElectronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances (EPCS): aims to stem increasing rates of opioid-related addiction, misuse diversion and death by making it more difficult for medication-seekers to doctor-shop and alter prescriptions. EPCS allows physicians to have access to aggregated electronic health records, which can provide data that will help them to prescribe opioids judiciously.\n\nFor more information on “Crush the Crisis,” visit hcahealthcare.com/crushthecrisis or call toll free number at (833) 582-1970.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

However, under the Biden Administration, the company was granted federal funding to assist with the investment.\n\nDue to rising cost estimates, the Trump Administration has now withdrawn this federal support, citing the project’s increasing reliance on taxpayer funding. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy stated that Amtrak supported the decision, noting that terminating the grant would allow the agency to prioritise improvements to existing services, with the freed-up funds redirected to other rail initiatives.\n\nThe ramifications of this decision were discussed in detail at Railway Interchange, held in Indianapolis 20-22 May 2025. During a panel discussion hosted by RSI, industry leaders considered the future of the Texas project, as well as the wider implications for rail investment across the US.\n\nThe Future of High-Speed Rail in Texas\n\nWhile the withdrawal of funding typically signals a setback, Robert Pearsall, Partnership Director at the US High Speed Rail Association (USHSR), argued that the decision could benefit the project in the long run.\n\nPearsall noted that Amtrak has limited experience in high-speed rail, and the current administration is not supportive of Amtrak-led efforts in this space. Therefore, removing Amtrak’s involvement may ultimately pave the way for a successful private sector-led development.\n\nIndeed, Amtrak’s exit may clear the path for private equity firms to take the lead—an approach already exemplified by the Brightline West project, which is largely funded by Fortress Investment Group. This model would better align with the administration’s preferences and could consequently set the project up for more long-term success.\n\nIn support of this argument, Pearsall emphasised the significance of For Worth-based Kleinheinz Capital Partners acquiring the remaining 440 million USD of Japanese investment in the Texas Central high-speed rail project. This buyout made Kleinheinz the primary owner of the proposed Dallas-to-Houston line, which plans to utilise Japanese Shinkansen technology.\n\nPearsall sees this as a significant turning point for the project, suggesting that Kleinheinz is now poised to inject billions in private equity into the project, pending state-level approvals.\n\nConsequently, with Amtrak out and private capital ready to be deployed, the project may have a clearer path forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Amtrak’s reasons for supporting the project remain, including high demand, good-sized population centres, limited stops, enclosed tracks, modern infrastructure, limited curves and simple topography. As a result, Pearsall asserted that Texas is well-positioned to succeed with a high-speed rail corridor, and suggested that a model driven by private equity could help provide a blueprint for the rest of the country.\n\nShifts in Funding Policies\n\nWhen considering the broader implications of the US DOT’s decision to terminate the grant, Husein Cumber, Senior Advisor at Brightline Holdings, emphasised that it sends a clear signal to the rail industry. Cumber argued that the current administration is setting an expectation that passenger rail projects must present a complete and credible financial plan before receiving federal support.\n\nHusein Cumber stated: The signal that the administration is sending is: if you don't have a complete financial plan for your project, they're not going to incrementally fund it.\n\nWith an estimated 40 billion USD project cost and an 80 million USD federal grant request, Cumber highlighted a lack of clarity as to where the remaining 39.9 billion USD would be sourced from.\n\nThis resulting perspective arguably points to the administration’s growing impatience with partial funding strategies and speculative project planning. Rather than backing ambitious rail ventures with limited upfront clarity, Washington appears to be shifting towards a model that prioritises financial certainty and fully scoped investment frameworks.\n\nThe Impact on the Rail Industry\n\nHowever, although US DOT’s decision may send a clear signal, Benji Schwartz, Director of Government Affairs and Advocacy at APTA noted that “nothing happens in a vacuum,” and the overall messaging coming out of Washington has been confusing to stakeholders. Schwartz pointed to examples such as post-award changes to grant agreements and blanket funding freezes that were implemented in the early days of the administration.\n\nAs a result, Schwartz cautioned that even if the withdrawal of funding from the Texas high-speed rail project ultimately proves beneficial, it risks sending a destabilising message. This atmosphere of unpredictability, he argued, is particularly harmful to large-scale infrastructure projects that rely on long-term planning and investment certainty. Delays, rising costs, and weakened stakeholder confidence could consequently follow.\n\nIn turn, this uncertainty may deter private investment—the very model the administration appears to favour. Indeed, Greg Regan, President at the Transportation Trades Department (TTD), AFL-CIO, noted that private investments are spurred by stable federal investments that encourage buy-ins. Without that foundation, industry confidence may falter.\n\nThe Outlook for US High-Speed Rail\n\nDespite this caution, Regan acknowledged that uncertainty will likely reduce once Brightline West demonstrates what is possible and launches its first high-speed services. Currently, the US does not have a proof of concept for true high-speed rail, which arguably remains a critical barrier to both public and private sector confidence.\n\nRegan argued: We need to get the first trains running to show people what is possible. Once you show people what is possible, then that 40 billion dollars becomes a whole lot more achievable because there's less risk.\n\nRegan further emphasised this point, stressing that a proof of concept could address one of the industry’s biggest financial obstacles: the cost of debt.\n\nHe cited the example of Brightline Florida, which initially issued debt at steep costs due to the perceived risk of being a first mover. Only after the line entered operation and reduced construction risk did it become possible to refinance at more favourable rates. This suggests that once a project proves itself, borrowing becomes cheaper, making large-scale capital stacks feasible.\n\nConsequently, focus is now likely to remain fixed on Brightline West, which is set to deliver the country’s first operational high-speed rail service. Industry stakeholders hope it will serve as the proof of concept needed to unlock future investment, but until then, uncertainty around federal commitments may continue to complicate long-term planning, presenting a roadblock for the future of high-speed rail in Texas.\n\n© Brightline\n\nFor additional insights for Railway Interchange, read: Can US Rail Survive Trump’s Second Term?\n\nTags", "source_domain": "railway-news.com"}

But the story behind the book signing that’ll take place early next month at the popular Warehouse District business might be as compelling as the story contained in the very book that the upcoming event aims to celebrate.\n\nOn Friday, Nov. 8, 21-year-old author Sammy Ragsdale will be hanging out at the coffee house to sign copies of “Fishing for Fin” — his new children’s book about a memorable fishing trip — that features illustrations from local artist Cynthia P. Childers.\n\nIt’ll take quite an effort for Ragsdale and his family to get here: Hitting the road from the tiny town of Zavalla (a rural east Texas community located about midway between Beaumont and Shreveport, La.), Ragsdale — who has cerebral palsy — can’t walk or talk without mechanical and technological assistance.\n\nThe limits nature has imposed on Ragsdale’s communication and mobility, though, won’t stop him from making the journey — just as they haven’t stopped him from writing Fishing for Fin in the first place. Thanks to a locally owned software company, as well as a local nonprofit, he was able to author and finish his first book with assistance from engineer Gaylon Ponder, the owner of a Bremen-based tech company known as Words+.\n\nWords+ makes the software Ragsdale used to write Fishing for Fin, and, as Ponder notes, it’s the 2024-updated version of the very same software that famed theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking used, while afflicted with ALS, to write his breakthrough bestselling cosmology book A Brief History of Time.\n\nThrough AAC Works, Org, the local nonprofit Ponder founded “to assist people who are speech and mobility impaired [to] find ongoing jobs that lead to successful vocational careers,” Ponder has been assisting Ragsdale using the internet throughout the young author’s book-writing journey, all while using Words+ — the very software company Ponder owns — as the go-to way for Ragsdale to put his ideas to digital paper.\n\nRather than remaining content with a life that relegates him to inactivity, Ragsdale has taken advantage of the proactive, can-do approach to disability that AAC Works, Org was created to foster.\n\nEmail newsletter signup\n\nPonder’s goal with the outreach is “to give people who don’t have the same physical abilities as the rest of us the ability to still be functional assets to society — rather than accept what society typically expects for them,” explains fellow children’s author Elena Caudle, the local friend whom Ponder sought out for book-writing advice after Ragsdale expressed an interest in writing a story of his own.\n\nWith copies of his now-published book in tow, Ragsdale will be the author of the hour at his Nov. 8 book signing at Karma’s. In the bargain, he’ll be handing out a unique kind of autograph — a digital “fingerprint” in place of the conventional scrawled signature his hands have denied him — that’s as singular as his own personal story.\n\nRagsdale will sign copies of his children’s book Fishing for Fin from 5:30 p.m. until 7 p.m. at Karma’s Coffee House in Cullman (103 First Avenue NE).", "source_domain": "cullmantimes.com"}

Check out our story calendar for more.\n\nWhen Josette Saxton was in high school, she wrote an essay about child abuse that was a red flag for a teacher who reached out to offer her help.\n\n“I was just being creative,” said Saxton, who is now a mental health policy associate for Texans Care for Children. “But what if I was someone who was feeling alone and it was a cry for help?”\n\nStarting Sept. 1, more Texas teachers will be trained to offer the kind of intervention Saxton’s teacher did when it is needed. Senate Bill 460, by state Sen. Robert Deuell, R-Greenville, will implement new requirements for mental health intervention strategies in schools that are intended to help teachers reach out to students who show signs of mental or emotional distress.\n\nUntil recently, talk about mental health policy in Texas was focused on treating serious mental health disorders rather than on assessing disorders before they escalate without treatment, Saxton said.\n\nAbout 288,000 children live with serious mental health conditions in Texas, according to 2010 figures from the National Alliance on Mental Illness. And those students, according to the Alliance, are more likely to drop out of school.\n\nHoping to prevent many of those students from dropping out, Texans Care for Children and a coalition of other groups that promote mental health and disability awareness, including the Texas Council for Developmental Disabilities and Mental Health America for Greater Houston, urged legislators this year to consider the need for positive intervention programs and for training educators.\n\nUnder the new law, school districts will be required to provide teachers, administrators and staff with training on mental health intervention and suicide prevention to help them identify red flags in a child’s behavior and respond effectively.\n\n“We’re not looking for schools to diagnose or treat kids,” Saxton said. The law, she added, is “a good starting place to increase a school’s ability to do a better job of recognizing when a child is having serious mental concerns and then knowing how they can respond in a way that won’t make it harder for students.”\n\nThe one-time training sessions could be implemented as soon as the upcoming school year.\n\nThe new training requirements will also lead to changes in the college curriculum for aspiring teachers at Texas universities. College students will receive instruction in the detection of mental or emotional disorders before receiving their diplomas.\n\nBehavioral management courses are already offered in education programs at several universities, but they are usually limited to students majoring in special education, said DeAnn Lechtenberger, director of technical assistance and community outreach at Texas Tech University’s Burkhart Center for Autism Education and Research.\n\nUniversities’ efforts to create additional behavioral management courses for students in general education programs will push the two disciplines to work collaboratively, Lechtenberger said.\n\nThe specialized behavioral management courses and training will fall under Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS, a program promoted by a federal special education technical assistance center.\n\nSupporters of the new law also hope the new training will reduce the segregation in classrooms of children with behavioral issues, including mental and emotional disorders.\n\nIf teachers are trained to implement methods of intervention that create a suitable learning environment for all students, they hope that students with behavioral disorders will be able to stay in regular classrooms.\n\n“Our goal is that every child is served with a regular curriculum,” said Belinda Carlton, public policy specialist for the Texas Council on Developmental Disabilities.\n\nCarlton said she hopes PBIS training at the college level will change educators’ philosophy “from the ground up,” starting with new teachers.\n\n“Even if we can’t educate every educator already in public schools, if every future educator has the training, we see this impacting on a system-wide level for the future,” Carlton said.\n\nQuick Facts about Children and Mental Health in Texas\n\nTEXAS RANKS 49th among the states in per-capita mental health spending\n\nCHILDREN WITH MENTAL ILLNESS Estimated1,200,000 • • • • • • • • • • Diagnosed288,000 • • • ■\n\nSTUDENTS QUALIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES Nearly three-quarters of students in Texas public schools were suspended or expelled at least once from 1999 to 2009.\n\nSCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES STAFF About 1 in 4 health services staff reported lacking training or support they needed to effectively address students' behavioral health in 2008.\n\nSPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS Nearly 1 in 3 special education teachers reported they do not have the training, support or supervision necessary to handle students' behavioral health issues in 2008.", "source_domain": "www.texastribune.org"}

Wednesdays at the Safeway in Fraser. Thursdays at the City Market in Granby.\n\nThe rig is one of six that soon will travel throughout rural Colorado, an effort to bring opioid-addiction treatment to people who have none where they live.\n\n“We want to bring it to the frontier towns,” said Nancy Smith Beste, executive director of Mountain Medical Road to Recovery, the Steamboat addiction treatment clinic that will operate the RV for the northwest region. Other stops on its route will include Kremmling and Oak Creek.\n\nThree of Colorado’s six RVs already are on the highway, parking in small towns in the northeast corner of the state, the southeast and the San Luis Valley. The other three are still under construction to turn the vehicles into mobile medical clinics, with bathrooms to collect urine samples, a nurse’s station and a private room for counseling sessions. Each will travel hundreds of miles per week.\n\nThe goal is that each of the six vehicles eventually will see at least 50 patients per week, providing medication-assisted treatment for those who are addicted to heroin or prescription opioids. Visits are by appointment or walk-in, and staff have been spreading the word at medical clinics, hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe towns were chosen by the state Office of Behavioral Health after officials reviewed data on overdose deaths and maps showing the areas of the state that have no clinics or doctors who prescribe medication-assisted treatment. The medicine to treat opioid addiction, buprenorphine, is a synthetic opioid used to eliminate withdrawal symptoms and has a low risk of overdose. It comes in pills, a patch or injection.\n\nUnlike methadone, which is dispensed at clinics strictly regulated by federal law, buprenorphine is available through prescription from physicians. The number of providers in Colorado willing to write those prescriptions has grown to nearly 1,800 in recent years, but stigma and prejudice about the people who seek the drug — sold under the brand name Suboxone — have prevented widespread access, said Robert Werthwein, director of the state Office of Behavioral Health.\n\nNeedles from heroin-users are collected in bins at the Harm Reduction Action Center in Capitol Hill. (Marvin Anani, Special to The Colorado Sun)\n\nThe six RVs are funded through a $6.7 million grant to Colorado from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which has awarded the state more than $45 million since 2017 for opioid addiction treatment and prevention. The funds have purchased almost 42,000 overdose kits that include naloxone, which can reverse the effects of an overdose, and were spent opening clinics, training doctors to prescribe buprenorphine and providing the medication in 16 county jails.\n\nThe idea for the traveling RVs came after Werthwein heard about a similar effort in New York while attending a conference two years ago. Besides helping people right away, a longer-term goal of the mobile units is to show local physicians how many people in their community need medication-assisted treatment — and spurring them to start prescribing the drugs.\n\n“There are some providers that are not aware that there is need in the community,” Werthwein said, noting opioid addiction is a “pretty widespread disease that covers a lot of individuals.”\n\n“They are sicker than dogs”\n\nWhen Beste, of Mountain Medical Road to Recovery, moved from the Denver area to Steamboat in 2017 to open the town’s first medication-assisted treatment center, she didn’t quite feel welcomed. “There was a lot of stigma when we got here, people saying it was trading one drug for another,” she said, meaning locals did not see the benefit of prescribing synthetic opioids to people who were trying to stay off heroin. “They were really hesitant.”\n\nSince then, Mountain Medical has “inducted” 160 clients into medication-assisted treatment. “It might not sound like a lot, but every time we say, ‘We saved another life,’” Beste said.\n\nThe Mountain Medical clinic opened in Routt County, one of the Colorado counties hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, thanks to a state grant. Clients include those who are homeless and destitute, as well as those who started with prescription opioids after getting injured skiing or cycling, and later turned to heroin, Beste said.\n\n“We have people who come in that nobody knew they were using heroin,” she said. “They say, ‘It’s taking all my money and my wife doesn’t know.’ You can’t tell. Most of the time you cannot even tell unless you really look at their pupils. And if they don’t use, they are just sicker than dogs.”\n\nA few clients drive from far-flung towns like Hayden, Oak Creek and even Winter Park, to seek help for their addiction. Sometimes they hitchhike to get there. And sometimes they stop coming because it’s easier to buy heroin where they live, Beste said.\n\nEven though the clinic has yet to get its RV, staff began setting up weekly pop-up clinics in rural towns in November.\n\nBeste, who helped one of her sons and a stepson through treatment for heroin addiction before becoming a certified addiction counselor, couldn’t quit thinking about people in rural Colorado who needed help — “people who have lost their kids and are now about to suddenly feel healthy and well and not have to go out and search for heroin or alcohol,” she said. “People who had given up.”\n\nRead more health stories from The Colorado Sun\n\n“Urgent care for addiction”\n\nEach RV will have a nurse, an addiction counselor and a peer coach who is in recovery from addiction. The rigs — with satellite capacity — will use telehealth to connect a patient with a doctor who can write prescriptions.\n\nFront Range Clinic, which opened about five years ago in Fort Collins and now has 19 clinics from northern Colorado to Grand Junction and in Farmington, New Mexico, will operate three of the six RVs.\n\nOne is already traveling all the way to Julesburg in the northeast corner of the state, with weekly stops in Sterling, Limon, Burlington, Holyoke and Sedgwick. Another sets up in parking lots in La Junta, Las Animas, Walsenburg, Springfield and Trinidad. And a third, coming-soon RV will head south from Colorado Springs to the mountain town of Westcliffe, plus Woodland Park, Fairplay, Buena Vista and Bailey.\n\nThree Front Range Clinic staff members travel by RV to visit patients seeking treatment for opioid addiction, stopping in a different town each day of the week from Julesburg to Burlington. From left, they are counselor Nicky Mclean, nurse Christi Couron and peer specialist Tonja Jimenez. (Provided by Front Range Clinic)\n\nFront Range Clinic also has 15 pop-up clinics — including in homeless shelters and needle-exchange programs, said Dr. Clark McCoy, president of the clinic. He views all of the clinics — the buildings, the pop-ups and the RVs — as “urgent care for addiction.”\n\n“Our mission is to get evidence-based addiction treatment to underserved populations,” he said, noting that all the clinics take Medicaid, private insurance and clients with no insurance. “Our model is low-barrier, high-access.”\n\nStaff in pop-up clinics have been telling people for months to spread the word about the RVs, and while some towns turn out only a handful of patients, others have kept staff busy. About 70% of Front Range’s patients addicted to opioids were using heroin, compared with 30% prescription opioids, he said. A growing number are also using fentanyl, he said.\n\n“We come to them”\n\nTonja Jimenez, a peer specialist who works in the RV that starts in Greeley each morning and heads east toward Kansas, began using meth, including intravenously, in 2010. Her ex-husband kicked her out when he found a meth pipe in their house, which sent her further into drug use and living in motels.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2012, after she had been arrested and found meth within 36 hours of posting bond, that she realized she was addicted.\n\n“It scared me,” she recalled. Jimenez turned herself into jail and waited for placement in a treatment clinic in Greeley.\n\nAfter treatment, she started life over again — got a job at a butcher shop, rented a room in an apartment, reestablished a relationship with her two kids, and earned a degree in psychology from the University of Northern Colorado.\n\nNow she counsels people who come to the mobile clinic. One woman showed up sick from withdrawals, which heroin-users describe like the worst flu — “You feel like you want to jump off a bridge for the first week or more. You can’t eat. You can’t sleep. You are just throwing up and can’t pull yourself out of bed,” Jimenez said. The woman was pale, hardly speaking and “you could tell she hadn’t showered in days,” Jimenez recalled.\n\nThe RV staff helped her get a prescription and a counseling session, and the next time the woman came back for a drug screen and prescription renewal, she was a different person. “She was laughing and telling me about her visit with her kids,” Jimenez said. “She was just full of life.”\n\nJimenez, who started working on the RV late last year, rolled into Limon one mid-morning last week. “We come to them,” she said. “We are giving people hope who didn’t have any.”", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com"}

About 12 years ago, her addiction landed her in jail for a month. Within 36 hours of her release, Jimenez was using again.\n\n\"It just all hit me that, 'Oh my Lord, I am an addict. I couldn't stop. I couldn't say no,'\" she said.\n\nBut Jimenez did say no. She went to treatment, got sober and continued her education. Last May, Jimenez earned a psychology degree from the University of Northern Colorado and is now the Mobile Health Unit's peer specialist.\n\n\"I just usually start off with small talk and if they need help finding resources for, let's say, homelessness, food, clothing, whatever it is that they might need help with,\" she said. \"That's what I'm here for.\"\n\nThe Mobile Health Unit is housed in a 34-foot Winnebago coach RV. It's small but fits a counseling room, a bathroom for a urine sample and an exam room. These are the necessary equipment and resources to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nThe unit provides medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to those addicted to opioids. MAT combines behavioral therapy with medications like buprenorphine or naltrexone, which reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The Mobile Health Unit also treats people with other substance use disorders.\n\nJimenez is part of a three-person, on-the-ground team that includes a nurse and licensed addiction counselor. Doctors are also available to meet with patients and write prescriptions via telehealth.\n\nFar Reaching Addiction Treatment\n\nIn 2018, Colorado received a federal opioid grant and used some of the funds to build six Mobile Health Units. They will serve 25 rural and frontier counties that were chosen for several reasons, including high opioid overdose death rates and lack of treatment facilities. The goal is to serve 300 people a week.\n\n\"What we plan to do is start in these communities. But while we're in these communities, we also want to get other providers to become medication-assistant treatment certified,\" said Robert Werthwein, director of the Office of Behavioral Health. \"Then hoping we build a capacity, then we can move on to the next community.\"\n\nFront Range Clinic was awarded three of the Mobile Health Units. The health care company provides MAT services at 19 brick and mortar locations and is embedded in more than a dozen community-based programs around the state.\n\n\"That's been part of the mission from the very beginning that we want to provide this low barrier, high access to care,\" said Jeremy Dubin, medical director at Front Range Clinic.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Front Range Clinic’s Mobile Health Unit parked near their Greeley office.\n\nTwo of Front Range Clinic's Mobile Health Units are currently in operation. They are based in Pueblo and Greeley and serve the Eastern Plains.\n\nThe Greeley unit covers the northeast and serves patients in Sedgwick, Logan, Phillips, Lincoln and Kit Carson counties. In 2017, only two of the counties had a facility that provided medication-assisted treatment and, according to state data, didn't take Medicaid.\n\nThe Mobile Health Unit goes to the same six locations every week, including a café, museum, hospital, pharmacy and community center. The providers will treat anyone regardless of insurance and patients can make appointments or walk in.\n\nBefore the Mobile Health Unit, people had to travel to bigger Front Range cities for services.\n\n\"We saw someone in a very remote town who was taking an entire day off work every month just to get their medicine,\" said Donna Goldstrom, clinical director of behavioral health services at Front Range Clinic. \"Now since we're in his town he literally comes to the mobile unit over his lunch break to get treatment.\"\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nBefore the units were ready, Front Range Clinic met with hundreds of people around the state to learn more about their community's needs. Shaun Wilson, executive director of Hope House, a transitional housing facility in Sterling, attended a presentation and got concerned because no one with a substance use disorder was there.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Front Range Clinic’s Mobile Health Unit uses a multi-panel drug test cup to test for 12 types of drugs.\n\n\"If we plan on addressing our opiate addiction, then I think what we need to be doing is listening to the voices of the individuals who are struggling with that addiction,\" Wilson said.\n\nWilson asked her residents to share their drug treatment experiences with Front Range Clinic. They said long wait lists and lack of services made it difficult to access treatment.\n\nFront Range Clinic listened to Hope House residents and other individuals who attended their meetings. The company prioritized their needs, according to Dayna DeHerrera-Smith, marketing and outreach coordinator, and made community members active participants and stakeholders in the project.\n\nThe Mobile Health Unit parks at Hope House when it's in Sterling.\n\n\"That's why we really enjoy the mobile unit,\" Wilson said. \"We can send individuals directly there and all of their needs are immediately met.\"\n\nHelp In Any Way\n\nThe Mobile Health Units are required to see 50 patients a week. The Greeley-based unit is not there yet, but according to Goldstrom, more patients visit every week and are receiving treatment for more than just opioid addiction.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Peer specialist Tonja Jimenez (center), nurse Christi Couron (left) and counselor Nicky McLean (right) stand in the exam room in the Front Range Clinic’s Mobile Health Unit.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of folks who have alcohol use disorder, people who have methamphetamine use disorder,\" she said. \"We want to help all of them, in anyway that we can.\"\n\nThe Greeley unit has served patients in northeast Colorado for about two months. Jimenez said she's mainly talked to people who come in for alcohol abuse but is looking forward to helping everyone.\n\n\"I understand it looks like there's no way out. But look at where I've been. Look at what I've accomplished. Look where I am today, there is a chance,\" Jimenez said. \"There is light at the end of that tunnel. You can make it.\"\n\nFront Range Clinic will own the Mobile Health Units after the grant ends and plans to continue the service. The long-term goal is to create lasting change by training local providers so they too can offer medication-assisted treatment in their own communities.", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org"}

The state has already surpassed the total amount of fentanyl seizures that set records last year.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration's Rocky Mountain Field Division has seized nearly 2.7 million fentanyl pills in the state which breaks last year's record-setting 2.61 million pills seized in Colorado. Those include fake or counterfeit fentanyl pills.\n\n\"It is an unfortunate record to set,\" said DEA RMFD Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Pullen in a statement. \"We continue to work day in, day out fighting the cartels putting this poison on Colorado streets. While we have seen seizure numbers trending lower in other parts of the country, Colorado seems to be consistently at or near record highs for the number of fake pills seized.\"\n\nCBS\n\nAccording to the DEA, lab testing reveals five out of every 10 pills analyzed contain a likely fatal dose of fentanyl for a first-time user. This is down from seven in 10 pills in 2023. Just two milligrams of fentanyl, the amount that can fit on the tip of the pencil, is considered a fatal dose.\n\n\"It's not a time to celebrate the lethality going down across the country. There's still a 50-50 chance you'll die after taking just one of these pills. It's a flip of a coin,\" Pullen added in a statement.\n\nAccording to the DEA RMFD, the vast majority of fake pills coming to Colorado are made by Mexican drug cartels to look like Oxycodone pills, or \"blues\" – counterfeit \"M30s\" – with an \"M\" stamped on one side, \"30\" for milligrams on the other.\n\nThe DEA is concerned about the recent appearance of carfentanil in Colorado. Carfentanil is an animal tranquilizer used to sedate or put down animals the size of elephants and rhinoceroses. Last month, the DEA said a seizure of 250,000 pills was determined to contain carfentanil which is 100 times more potent than fentanyl.\n\nAdditional Information from the DEA RMFD:\n\nWhile it took Colorado eleven months to break last year's record pill seizures, Utah broke its pill seizure record (668,000) in the first six months this year (774,000). Within the DEA Rocky Mountain Field Division, Wyoming and Montana have seen pill seizures trend lower over the course of 2024.\n\nLast year's pill seizure total for the entire four-state Division was approximately 3.4 million pills seized. 2024 Division numbers will likely be released in late January 2025.", "source_domain": "www.cbsnews.com"}

His oldest has autism, and the family struggled to find the care they needed while living in a therapy desert.\n\nThat’s why about six years ago, he put his career as an investor and entrepreneur on hold to start a pediatric mental health clinic in his Colorado community called Vail Mind Center. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, he learned something: the vast majority of the clinic’s patients thrived while receiving care virtually.\n\n“I was like, ‘My gosh, if we can have this kind of impact virtually, I can do much more than just what we’re doing here in our county,’” he said in an interview.\n\nSponsored Post Improving Medical Billing to Cut Payment Bottlenecks Yusuf Qasim, President of Payments Optimization at Zelis, discussed how the company is transforming healthcare payments from a fragmented, patchwork system into a modern, digital infrastructure.\n\nSo three years ago, Graf founded Healthy Young Minds, an online youth mental health company. This month, the company was crowned winner of MedCity News’ INVEST Pitch Perfect contest focused on pediatric mental health. A total of six companies participated in the contest.\n\nThe Denver-based startup treats children for a range of needs, including autism, anxiety and depression. Patients start with an evaluation to get matched with the right services and therapists. They’ll then start their teletherapy sessions on a schedule that works for them. Healthy Young Minds’ services include testing and diagnosing, psychology, art therapy, music therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy.\n\nThe company currently operates in six states: California, Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Texas and Georgia. It works with both Medicaid and commercial insurance plans and has about 35 million lives under contract.\n\nThere are several other companies addressing youth behavioral health — such as Brightline. However, a major differentiator for Healthy Young Minds compared to others in the space is the fact that it accepts Medicaid, Graf declared. And the need is there: There are nearly 40 million kids enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP, yet many are unable to receive mental health support.\n\n“It’s our goal and plan to be the leading Medicaid provider for kids across the country. And there’s very little competition out there right now,” Graf said. “I expect that to change as we grow and demonstrate the viability of serving Medicaid, and it’s very rewarding. So many of the folks out there that are working towards serving children, they don’t take insurance at all, or they take commercial insurance. It’s the exception if anyone’s out there taking Medicaid. There’s a lot of competition out there to serve kids. When I look at what I think is so exciting about Healthy Young Minds, it’s that we have a model that is focused on serving the most underserved and the most needy in the country.”\n\nThe startup has raised some funds as well. So far, Healthy Young Minds has secured $6 million (with Graf contributing about half), and it is currently in the process of raising its Series A round. This funding will go toward building its team, hiring more clinicians, developing its technology, expanding to new states, and establishing more partnerships, particularly with health systems.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is focused on engaging with as many Medicaid plans as possible while “retaining the absolute highest quality care,” Graf said.", "source_domain": "medcitynews.com"}

However, that means we also need to make sure people understand the risks, know how to use it safely if they choose to and that healthcare systems are prepared,” said Joshua Black, PhD, co-lead author and senior scientist at Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety, a division of Denver Health.\n\nThe study also revealed a gap in how well current medical coding systems track psilocybin-related problems in emergency departments. While poison center calls have gone way up, very few cases are recorded in hospital ambulatory data.\n\n“If hospitals and public health systems aren’t seeing the full picture, they can’t respond appropriately,” Black said. “Improved tracking tools and education are critical as more states consider regulating or legalizing psilocybin.”\n\nThe study utilized data from five major national surveys from 2014-2023. Data was used from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Survey of Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs (NMURx), Monitoring the Future (MTF), the National Poison Data System (NPDS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS).\n\nThis was a collaborative project with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), but the views expressed here are those of the authors and may not represent the positions of SAMHSA.", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu"}

Jared Polis ‘disheartened’ by communication gaps in child fentanyl cases", "published_at": "2025-04-02T15:44:51.693000", "full_text": "When Aviyana Montoya died in 2022, the toddler had ingested so much fentanyl a prosecutor said it was “10 times the amount” that would kill an adult.\n\nShe was “cold to the touch” when adults found her unresponsive in her bedroom, and when paramedics arrived, they said “signs of rigor mortis” had already taken effect.\n\nThe little girl, who was approaching her second birthday, had been living in a home that had been used for a drug-dealing operation, according to prosecutors who handled the crimina l case against her parents.\n\nA death investigation conducted by the state’s Child Fatality Review Team indicated, “the parents... had been selling fentanyl to pay for their cocaine.”\n\nAviyana's case is one of two Colorado child fentanyl deaths Scripps News highlighted in December 2024 after receiving access to recently released death investigation reports and other public records.\n\nScripps News wanted to know: were there warning signs before their deaths, and were those red flags handled properly?\n\nCommunication failures\n\nAfter reviewing the records in Aviyana’s case and in the case of another toddler who died of fentanyl poisoning in Aurora in 2021, Scripps News discovered that communication failures between law enforcement and child welfare workers preceded each child’s death.\n\nSeveral months prior to their deaths, both children had a parent who had a drug-related run-in with the police — in which the child was present.\n\nIn both cases, law enforcement officers failed to alert child welfare workers about the incidents, against their agencies’ policies.\n\n“Governor Polis is disheartened by these stories and committed to ensuring that law enforcement properly notifies and coordinates with state agencies to ensure the safety of all Colorado children,” said Shelby Wieman, a spokesperson for Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, in response to Scripps News’ investigation .\n\nWhat happened in each case\n\nMore than a year before Aviyana’s death, a Colorado State Patrol trooper pulled over Aviyana’s father while she was riding in his car.\n\nThe officer arrested him for drug and child abuse charges but did not notify child welfare workers about the incident , in violation of the agency’s policy, according to Sgt. Patrick Rice, a spokesperson for the agency.\n\n“Our policy is that the responding trooper contact a CSP victim's advocate to work with human services and the family, or contact human services directly,” said Rice.\n\nIn the Aurora case, first responders revived a mother with the opioid reversal antidote, naloxone, after she passed out behind the wheel of her vehicle with her child in the car.\n\nNo one alerted child welfare workers about the incident, according to Joe Moylan, a spokesperson for the Aurora Police Department, and about nine months later, the child died of fentanyl poisoning.\n\n“The officer was disciplined and suspended for 20 hours without pay,” Moylan said.\n\nWhat lawmakers are saying\n\n“Especially having seen your story, I think it’s critical that we take a look and see what is missing in the breakdown in that communication,” said Rep. Chad Clifford, a Democrat who sits on Colorado’s legislative judiciary committee.\n\nIn Colorado , “mandatory reporters,” including peace officers, physicians, school employees, and many others, are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect to either a county child welfare agency, to the child abuse hotline, or a local law enforcement agency.\n\nHowever, police officers are not mandated, under state law, to report child abuse claims directly to child welfare workers, according to the Colorado Office of the Attorney General.\n\n“Statute requires peace officers to report suspected child abuse, but that can be to a law enforcement agency or child protective services,” said Lawrence Pacheco, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Office of the Attorney General.\n\n“There is not a specific requirement that cases are reported to child protective services, although many agencies have individual policies in place to require this type of reporting,” he said.\n\n“I think we definitely need to address this some way with legislation,” Rep. Clifford said.\n\n“I would assert that there are police departments around the state and sheriff’s departments that do have good communications and relationships with child protective services,\" he said. \"I think we should probably take a look at what has been working in areas - if it is - and get some feedback ... and then codify something, so that it’s more universal.”\n\nState Sen. John Carson, a Republican who sits on the state’s judiciary and health and human services committees, said he believes communication should be enhanced.\n\n“What you reported on...indicates we do need to have more communication out there at all levels of society,” he said. “We need more education to parents. We need more education to law enforcement. We need education here at the Capitol with state legislators. And we’ve got to figure out how to get a handle on this and prevent more deaths.”\n\nCarson said he is a proponent of increasing penalties for possessing fentanyl, and if he believes it is warranted, he would consider a new law.\n\n“If there’s legislation or work we need to do to improve that communication, I would want to take a look at that,” he said. “I’m interested in looking at anything that might help. But a lot of times you find there’s a lot of legislation already out there – a lot of regulations already out there – they're just not being followed...we ought to first take a look at that and make sure that the agencies are following the guidelines and the rules and that it’s a top priority.”\n\nA spokesperson for Polis said the issue is important.\n\n“Governor Polis is open to ideas that keep our kids safe and prevent this type of communication breakdown from occurring again, ensuring that Colorado’s Division of Child Welfare has the information it needs to protect Colorado kids. Governor Polis is committed to making Colorado one of the top ten safest states, and that includes protecting our communities and kids from the scourge of fentanyl,” said Wieman.\n\nAn ongoing problem\n\nCommunication issues like these have been a problem for many years, according to state records reviewed by Scripps News.\n\nThe Child Fatality Prevention System — which is administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment — reported “a need to address issues with information sharing between agencies,” as far back as 2016 .\n\nScripps News also repeatedly found similar recommendations for improved communication in annual reports prepared by the state’s Child Fatality Review Team , which operates under the Colorado Department of Human Services .\n\n“I think that’s going to be something that’s going to be in progress for a while,” April Jenkins, a manager for CDHS's child protection and prevention unit, told Scripps News in December last year.\n\nIn response to questions about how communication issues would be addressed by CDHS, a spokesperson told Scripps News that it was planning a “workgroup” that would focus on “designing standard protocols for enhancing working relationships and communication” between human services, social services, and law enforcement agencies statewide.\n\nA CDHS spokesperson told Scripps News that a preliminary planning group met last week and planned to reach out to counties and law enforcement agencies to participate in the workgroup.\n\nLouisiana state investigation identifies similar breakdown\n\nScripps News also found similar communication breakdowns in other states.", "source_domain": "www.scrippsnews.com"}

No other player could touch his mark of 28 3-pointers made during the 2 minutes.\n\n“I knew early that inside wasn’t really my game,” Teff admitted. “I focused all my life on shooting and have gotten really good at it. It is what got me here. I’ve thankful that I put in all the work to get me here.”\n\nThrough 10 games this season Teff is 33-for-94 from 3-point range for a pretty impressive 35 percent. He had a season-high 21 points on seven 3-pointers before winter break against Rocky Mountain.\n\nWhile becoming one of the best 3-point shooters in Class 5A took a lot of hard work, Teff also had to overcome being born with Cerebral Palsy.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I’ve kind of had to adapt all my life,” Teff said. “It just makes my right side a lot weaker than my left. Normal things are sometimes challenging for me. Opening a door or gripping stuff with my right hand. I’ve been able to overcome and adapt.”\n\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood.\n\nTeff gives a lot of credit to his father for teaching him that he can do anything that he puts his mind to. Physical therapy for several years, dribbling weighted basketballs with his right hand to get stronger, along with getting in the weight room put Teff in the position to be a key contributor his senior year for the Chargers.\n\n“Honestly, my first impression was it’s going to be tough,” Chatfield boys basketball coach Erik Buehler said of Teff being able to reach playing at a 5A varsity level. “Basketball is a sport that requires a certain amount of athleticism.”\n\nTeff has proven himself to his coaches at every level that he can adapt and overcome some of his physical limitations.\n\n“Midway through his sophomore year I was like, ‘This kid is one of the best shooters I’ve ever coached,” Buehler said. “On top of that even as a freshman his (basketball) IQ was well above his age. He just got smarter and smarter. He studied the game and to his credit he realized if he could become an elite shooter it would allow him to continue to play basketball.”\n\nThere was never any doubt in Teff’s mind that he could play high school basketball. One of his best friends — senior Christian Foutch — knew the two would be on the court as seniors for the Chargers.\n\n“He is one of the best players on the court all the time,” said Foutch, who has been friends with Teff since preschool and was actually talked into playing organized basketball by Teff starting in the 7th grade. “He has definitely outworked everybody to be here. He put his mind to it and wanted to be here. It’s cool that he wanted to be apart of this team and grind it out to be with me and a bunch of the other boys.”\n\nFoutch actually didn’t know Teff had CP until both were in a middle school together.\n\n“Honestly, I had no idea Parker had anything until about the 8th-grade. We were doing pushups together,” Foutch said. “I asked him what was up. He said he has Cerebral Palsy. I was like, ‘What? How long have you had that?’ I had no idea.”\n\nOpponents on the basketball court might not realize either. They might be too busy watching Teff drain 3-pointer after 3-pointer from the corner on them.\n\n“I have never seen a kid with CP play varsity sports,” Buehler said. “I think his work ethic and mindset has allowed him to do that.”", "source_domain": "chsaanow.com"}

The remaining two locations will only provide speech therapy and occupational therapy for children with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDDs).\n\nHopebridge’s CEO, David McIntosh, attributes the cuts to Colorado’s insufficient Medicaid reimbursement, intractable state officials and significant increases to state operating costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Colorado Medicaid has left us no other choice than to withdraw from ABA services,” McIntosh said.\n\nHopebridge isn’t the only autism provider facing these challenges. Low Medicaid rates are typical of safety-net health plans across the country. However, they are often especially low for most behavioral health services.\n\nFurther, inflation across the U.S. has effectively eaten away at the value of stagnant fee-for-service rates for several payer types.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNationally, consumer costs have increased 18.7% compared to May 2019 and 2023, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. In Colorado, prices increased 19.8%, similar to the Western region of the U.S. which saw a 19.4% increase.\n\nOperating in states like Colorado that have a higher-than-typical cost of living can create additional staffing challenges too.\n\n“We can no longer serve the autism population sustainably through ABA therapy, but we can continue to make a profound impact on these families through our speech and occupational therapy service offerings,” a spokesperson for the company told Behavioral Health Business.\n\nThe two remaining centers — in Greeley and Westminster — will offer occupational and speech therapy to “an additional population,” the company told BHB. These two offices will inform how to improve and expand these services through Hopebridge’s 360 Care model.\n\nHopebridge operates in 12 states. McIntosh said that the company is also opening locations in Thompson’s Station, Tennessee, and in Northport, Florida, and is also expanding speech and occupational services to all Tennessee locations.\n\nThe company has prioritized expanding supporting services via 360 Care through Hopebridge’s footprint, McIntosh previously told BHB.\n\nHopebridge is owned by the New York City-based private equity firm Arsenal Capital Partners. The deal was announced in May 2019.\n\nHopebridge isn’t the only provider facing these challenges. In recent weeks, another large private equity-backed autism therapy company announced it would shutter operations in a number of states, including Colorado. Invo Healthcare announced it will close its in-home and in-office care divisions. The move will result in over 1,000 people losing their jobs, 239 of whom are in Colorado.\n\nThe specifics related to Invo Healthcare’s departure from Hopebridge differ at a fundamental level. Invo Healthcare did not have a large Medicaid patient base; “It was a tiny percentage for them,” according to a spokesperson for the company.\n\nLow reimbursement without a moderating force\n\nWhile Hopebridge wouldn’t disclose the share of its business that comes from Medicaid reimbursements other than to say that it serves “a large Medicaid population in Colorado and our eleven other states.”\n\nThe company’s high exposure to Colorado’s low Medicaid rate made it especially vulnerable to the increased cost of operating in the state. McIntosh said that inflation and cost of living rates seen at the company are 20% higher than the other states it operates in.\n\nOn top of the local economic forces, Hopebrige’s struggle in Colorado demonstrates the challenge of engaging with state Medicaid programs.\n\nAutism therapy providers, along with other behavioral health providers, suffer from little enforcement of federal rules that require behavioral health services to be compensated at parity with physical health care services.\n\nBecause of autism therapy’s focus on the pediatric population, it lacks the moderating influence of Medicare, the federal health plan for seniors.\n\n“If you think about the reimbursement for health care services that treat all age ranges, you have Medicare providing a sort of middle ground of what most provider will accept as the standard,” Jeffrey Hulbert, chief revenue officer for Henderson, Nevada-based Center for Autism and Related Disorders (CARD), told BHB. “Then, around that (Medicare), most commercial plans pay higher than that and most Medicaid plans pay lower than that.”\n\nOther segments of health care can balance sources of health plan revenue when all three — commercial health plans, Medicare and Medicaid — cover a patient population, Hulbert said. However, ABA services skew heavily toward Medicaid because most patients are children, covered by part of Medicaid that covers children, Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nCARD presently operates 130 locations in 14 states, 9 of which are in Colorado.\n\nHulbert estimates that Medicaid and commercial reimbursement rates can differ by about 5% to 10%. That differential can be higher in states where Medicaid reimbursement is low and commercial health plan reimbursement is high.\n\n“Some states (New Jersey) have higher reimbursement rates for ABA services, while others may have lower rates,” Stacy DiStefano, CEO of Consulting for Human Services (CHFS), told BHB. “At CFHS we counsel our clients to have a portfolio mix and not rely on any one type of service.”\n\nLessons learned from Hopebridge and Colorado\n\nABA providers in Colorado may be a canary for other autism providers accepting Medicaid across the country. Hopebridge opened its first location in the fall of 2020, persevering through the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. It had planned to open in early 2020.\n\nThe company announced in February 2020 that it would open its first two locations in Denver and Aurora and that it intended to open as many as 12 over the next 1.5 years.\n\nColorado has some features that make it an attractive state to do business. It’s one of the fastest-growing states in terms of population. DiStefano said the state is known for being interested in creating greater accessibility to services. She pointed to a 2015 law that removed age and total payment caps on mandated autism coverage.\n\nABA coverage is not covered by the state’s Medicaid managed care organizations; providers contract directly with the state.\n\nThat creates a handful of issues, according to Hulbert. CARD has grappled with Colorado’s electronic verification system and other administrative requirements, making working with the state “particularly more burdensome than … some of the MCO states where the Medicaid plans are through a health plan.”\n\nMCOs are often part of larger health insurance conglomerates with more savvy in handling health plans. Further, working with the same overarching organization’s MCO and commercial health plans can lead to easier administration of claims.\n\nColorado Medicaid has left us no other choice than to withdraw from ABA services David McIntosh, CEO of Hopebridge\n\nHowever, the CEO of a Colorado-focused ABA company said his company hasn’t had a similar administrative struggle working with the state. Regardless of the administrative aspect, the low rate and lack of meaningful increases have had and will likely have an impact on the direction of his company.\n\n“We want to serve Medicaid; it’s core to our mission of what we want to do,” the source told BHB. “At some point, we’re going have to stop taking Medicaid or substantially reduce the number of Medicaid kids we treat or create waitlists.”\n\nBHB granted the CEO anonymity because of the importance of the Colorado market to the company’s operations and to allow frank insights.\n\nThis CEO said the company would always take some Medicaid patients but wouldn’t jeopardize the company’s sustainability by doing so.\n\nLike in other instances, the coronavirus pandemic touched off many of the challenges that autism providers face. CARD held up the pandemic as the driving force that led it into bankruptcy. Medicaid rates in Colorado were tight, the CEO said, but the pandemic made them unsustainable.\n\n“[Low rates] force providers into things that really harm care quality,” the CEO said, “for example, driving high [patient] ratios, adding lots of clients under one BCBA, penny-pinching with RBTs.”\n\nStill, the direct proximity to the entity setting rates for ABA creates an opportunity for lobbying to lead to better future rates.\n\nSome states have changed their tune on reimbursement. Hulbert pointed to efforts in Louisiana in 2022. Lobbying efforts led to what he described as a “pretty significant increase in their Medicaid rates.” That bill passed in June 2022.\n\nColorado is undergoing an administrative process to reassess its Medicaid rates. The Medicaid Provider Rate Review Committee is holding a public meeting on July 14 that is slated to include behavioral health generally and pediatric behavioral health specifically.\n\n“I would point to something like [the Louisiana rate increase] as an example to show that if the parties can come together, they might be able to find a solution, that may not be perfect, but may work for both sides,” Hulbert said.", "source_domain": "bhbusiness.com"}

And those who haven’t have several options – including CME from the Texas Medical Association – for getting trained, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\nPhysicians won’t have to submit training-related documentation but should be able to reference it in the event of an audit, Texas Medical Association experts say.\n\nThe new requirement came under the Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act, which Congress passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Under the law, physicians and other health care professionals who prescribe Schedule II, III, IV, and V medications will be required to check a box on their online DEA registration form to show that they have done the training, SAMHSA says.\n\nThat means starting June 27, physicians who are new or renewing DEA registrants as of that date will need one of the following upon submission of their application:\n\nEight hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders.\n\nBoard certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry from the American Board of Medical Specialties, American Board of Addiction Medicine, or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).\n\nGraduation within five years from a U.S. medical school that included successful completion of an opioid or other substance use disorder curriculum of at least eight hours.\n\nCriteria for the eight hours of CME are flexible because “SAMHSA has elected not to pursue the option to approve specific training organizations” or “undertake a lengthy rulemaking process” about the training, the agency says. Given that, SAMHSA estimates that more than 2,000 organizations offer or plan to offer training that may satisfy the eight-hour requirement.\n\nQualifying CME options\n\nThose organizations include TMA, which offers several courses totaling 8 hours of relevant CME that is free for members.\n\nPhysicians also have flexibility in how to complete the training, says Mesquite pain specialist C.M. Schade, MD, a former TPS president. The training does not have to be completed in one session but can be spread out across multiple sessions that equal eight hours. And the trainings can occur in multiple formats, including in classrooms, seminars, professional society meetings, and online formats.\n\nTPS also is working quickly to develop a single eight-hour course to help physicians meet the DEA requirement, says Dr. Menard.\n\nOther Texas organizations, such as the Texas Opioid Training Initiative, also offer CME that appears to satisfy the mandate.\n\nPhysicians can complete the training with the help of national organizations such as the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, the American Medical Association, ASAM, AOA, and any organizations accredited by the AOA in CME, DEA says.\n\nWhile some CME courses are free, others are not, and physician leaders acknowledge many doctors understandably bridle at yet another unfunded, time-consuming professional requirement.\n\nAMA and other physician organizations successfully advocated against the requirement when it was proposed under the MATE Act in 2021. It was later tacked on last minute to the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act over medicine's objections.\n\nThe American Society of Addiction Medicine endorsed the new requirement, saying lack of standardization in addiction prevention and treatment has hampered the U.S. response to the addiction and overdose crisis.\n\nA mandate with a silver lining?\n\nMichael Sprintz, DO, a Houston specialist in pain, addiction, and anesthesia, sees a silver lining. Virtually all medical practices have at least some patients with undiagnosed substance use disorders and learning the basics can save physicians time and money because they’ll be able to recognize those patients and get them treated.\n\n“It will make your practice easier because you’ll start to see what you couldn’t see before,” said Dr. Sprintz, who is co-writing the curriculum for the TPS training. “An untreated substance use disorder is a real challenge to a practice. … Being able to identify a patient with a [substance use disorder] and helping to get appropriate treatment helps the patient, the practice, and the health care system overall.”\n\nThe MATE training is not to be confused with the X waiver – a requirement for prescribing buprenorphine that the Consolidated Appropriations Act did away with, Dr. Schade says. That waiver required not only eight hours of training but also rigid documentation rules for prescriptions and the potential for inspection by DEA agents.\n\nReplacing the X waiver requirements with this broader training on substance use disorder for all health care professionals registering with DEA represents progress, he says.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org"}

That behavior that can leave younger users vulnerable to misleading and inaccurate information. Because AI platforms often rely on user prompts as another source of training data, either company could also be violating young user's privacy and misusing their data. This is of particular interest in Texas, where the SCOPE Act places specific limits on what companies can do with data harvested from minors, and requires platform's offer tools so parents can manage the privacy settings of their children's accounts.\n\nFor now, the Attorney General has submitted Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to both Meta and Character.AI to see if either company is violating Texas consumer protection laws. As TechCrunch notes, neither Meta nor Character.AI claim their AI chatbot platforms should be used as mental health tools. That doesn't prevent there from being multiple \"Therapist\" and \"Psychologist\" chatbots on Character.AI. Nor does it stop either of the companies' chatbots from claiming they're licensed professionals, as 404 Media reported in April.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The user-created Characters on our site are fictional, they are intended for entertainment, and we have taken robust steps to make that clear,\" a Character.AI spokesperson said when asked to comment on the Texas investigation. \"For example, we have prominent disclaimers in every chat to remind users that a Character is not a real person and that everything a Character says should be treated as fiction.\"\n\nMeta shared a similar sentiment in its comment. \"We clearly label AIs, and to help people better understand their limitations, we include a disclaimer that responses are generated by AI — not people,\" the company said. Meta AIs are also supposed to \"direct users to seek qualified medical or safety professionals when appropriate.\" Sending people to real resources is good, but ultimately disclaimers themselves are easy to ignore, and don't act as much of an obstacle.\n\nWith regards to privacy and data usage, both Meta's privacy policy and the Character.AI's privacy policy acknowledge that data is collected from users' interactions with AI. Meta collects things like prompts and feedback to improve AI performance. Character.AI logs things like identifiers and demographic information and says that information can be used for advertising, among other applications. How either policy applies to children, and fits with Texas' SCOPE Act, seems like it'll depend on how easy it is to make an account.", "source_domain": "www.engadget.com"}

I had fluid on the cerebellum of my brain; this affected my white matter and my brain’s function, both neurologically and with my cognitive function.\n\nThis kind of made me a little bit of an outcast. I was bullied a lot, but I reverted to being good at sports and pushing myself as hard as I could to be the best version of myself. Luckily, I had loving parents and a plethora of siblings to really push me and make me be my best. So, you know, growing up, I really gravitated towards wrestling, and wrestling’s one-on-one sport that allowed me to anticipate the movements of others and really push myself to be my best.\n\nBut I never really knew about the parasports and Paralympic world until I aired on “Survivor” with Noelle Lambert. She pulled me aside after we were both voted off because we were voted off back to back, and she had stated, hey, you mild cerebral palsy, you can run the Paralympics. She opened that door for me, and she allowed me to get that information to make this journey possible. Without that, I would have just been a “Survivor” guy, not a Paralympian.\n\nWell, I’ve got to tell you congratulations on all of your accomplishments. And you’ve got to wonder what those bullies are thinking right now. What does it mean to you to be among such an elite group of folks representing your country?\n\nIt’s been mind-bending in a way. It’s stupendous to go from like, like you said, being bullied to being the top percent of athletes in the world. But it’s not only that gratitude you get from being able to represent your country, but it’s the community and the friendship you find within that community that allows you to really become one with yourself, at least for me.\n\nBecause before the Paralympic or the para track and field world, I really didn’t know as much about my disability, and I kind of shied away from it, because it made me, when I was younger, bullied, and it made life a little bit harder. So I tried to be as normal as possible.\n\nBut by being part of this community and learning more about myself and learning more about others and learning that I’m not the only one that … feels pain or gets headaches while pushing too hard, or experiences these CP problems. It really has allowed me to accept more of myself and try to become a better version of myself. That’s something I wouldn’t have been able to get without experiencing this community and pushing myself to the absolute limit to be the best, you know?\n\nSelf development has been fantastic. And the honor and the pride I have in representing and making every person that believes in me, has ever said good luck – like my mother just other day said, “I’m not surprised, but I am proud” – it’s fantastic to be able to show them that their belief was well put.\n\n» MORE: Laredo’s first Olympian is going for gold in Paris this summer\n\nWhat an inspiring attitude you have. What events are you competing in during the Paralympics, and what sort of goals have you set for yourself here?\n\nSo right now I already have the start rights for the 100- and the 400-meter. I have asked and requested start rights for the long jump because I didn’t long jump at trials. I wanted to make sure that my body was ready for the 100 and 400, because it takes a lot out of me.\n\nRight now, I’m second in the world for the 400, and I have become faster in my 100. I was .07 off from third place in Japan, and I’ve gotten more than that faster. So, I’m really looking to pull out all the stops: At least second, at most first. You know, you always want to go for the gold. We’re already here. There’s no point in going, “oh, yeah, I might medal.” No, I’m going to medal; I just want to try to get the gold one.\n\nWhat your training routine like now?\n\nMy training blocks usually look like a Monday, Wednesday, Friday hard days: I work out at the track, and then I work out at the gym to superset. What this does is stimulate the neurons in your brain to be explosive for sprints.\n\nI’ve always been strong. But strength doesn’t equal power and speed. You have to translate that in your brain. So being able to do sprints and then a gym workout with Olympic lifts and structural functionality with, you know, being able to balance and have core experience, that really allows you to be functional on the track.\n\nAnd then my off days, or my functional off days, are going to be Tuesday and Saturday. I do a circuit, which consists of several workouts that mimic kind of a sprinting form but allows me to work arms, legs, arms, legs, and a circuit manner to increase my conditioning.\n\n» GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard’s weekly newsletters\n\nI’m sort of curious. You’re so inspiring with the way that you talk about how you’re going for the gold here. Do you have personal inspirations, role models, that sort of thing you may be watching?\n\nSo my personal inspirations are actually not in track and field. I would have to relate those back to my parents. I am impressed by Olympic athletes. They do fantastic. I love watching them. It is, like you said, inspirational. But my personal inspiration would be my mom and dad.\n\nMy dad is a war hero. He came from the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo, to fight for our country. And in Operation Iraqi Freedom was awarded the Bronze Star valor, for an outstanding performance and bravery in the war.\n\nBut my mom also was a stroke survivor. She was part of a class action lawsuit of women that experienced strokes from taking a birth control. When I was around 11 years old, she had a stroke that took out two-thirds of her brain. She was never supposed to walk, talk, eat on her own. But yet this woman does a market every Sunday with all the art that she paints.\n\nShe runs marathons. She does cycling without the use of her left side. She doesn’t feel her left side. She can’t see left. But yet she does not let that stop her. And as a child that grew up with traumatic brain injury or my mild cerebral palsy, it really connected me with my mother while she was going through that recovery process, and it helped her to have somebody there for her, and I really enjoyed being that person for her. And it made our connection stronger.\n\nSo having those parents that really have gone above and beyond, to have that full life and give me a life that I could be proud of and teach me, you know, to really give my all is my motivation. It’s that hand on my back pushing me forward, to become better and and show them, you know, every step, every little fit that I threw as a kid was worth it. And they’ve believed in me more than I believed in myself.\n\nOne of the reasons I ask that question is because I can’t help but think others are going to be watching you and will be inspired by your performance in Paris. What sort of advice might you give to young athletes, especially those with disabilities, perhaps, who aspire to compete at these championship levels?\n\nSo that’s a wonderful question. I’ve actually gotten a lot of feedback from athletes that I’ve helped, because I like to give tips and things at the track. If anybody seems interested, I ask them, “hey, you want to learn something?” And I’ve had several of my athletes come and message me, “congratulations, you’re inspiring.” And it’s them reaching out and the fact that I’ve inspired them that kind of warms my heart in a way.\n\nNot to be cheesy, but it really does put a smile on my face when somebody – not only athletic, but I have parents that have children with cerebral palsy that have been diagnosed. I recently had somebody message me on Instagram. I think their son’s name was Clayton and he’s 4 years old, started walking just a few months ago, and that was just like me. I started walking at 4.\n\nAnd it’s the hope that I give, that light that people might not have had, that see my story and go, “okay, it’s not the end of the world. We have something to work towards, even if it’s not quite that level. We can’t just give up. We got to keep pushing.” And it’s that: You got to keep pushing. There’s always another day; there’s always another step to take. And it’s not giving up on yourself and surrounding yourself with people that are going to hold you accountable.\n\nBecause some days, I’m going to be honest with you, you don’t want to do it. It’s either a mental or physical block. And you got to really have a support group, whether it’s a mantra you tell yourself or somebody that really is honest with you saying, “hey, you have goals, you need to go get it,” that you need to set up for yourself. Because we are human and we have errors.\n\nBut it’s keeping that environment as positive as possible, and as easy as it is to say no, make it that much easier to say yes – to go train, to go push yourself to be that best version of yourself, so you can look back and have no regrets, and you can be proud of everything that you’ve done.", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org"}

These strips, which can detect the deadly opioid in drugs, are seen as a simple and effective tool to prevent overdose deaths. Despite broad support, the bill failed to make it past the Texas Senate last year. Lawmakers remain hopeful that renewed efforts will lead to a breakthrough.\n\nRepresentative James Talarico, D-Williamson County, has re-filed HB 253, the bill aimed at decriminalizing the test strips.\n\n“There are only five states that still outlaw these test strips, and Texas is one of them. So, we’ve got to change this so that we can start saving lives here in our state,” Talarico said.\n\nDespite bipartisan support for fentanyl test strip legalization, previous bills failed to pass through the Texas Senate. Governor. Greg Abbott voiced his support for decriminalization during the last session.\n\n“People will be able to test drugs at home to know whether or not it might be laced with fentanyl,” Abbott said, following a visit with University of Houston researchers who developed a fentanyl vaccine.\n\nTalarico, who authored the bill, emphasized the life-saving potential of fentanyl test strips.\n\n“This is a simple, low-cost way to save lives in the middle of this fentanyl crisis. It passed the Texas House last session by an overwhelming bipartisan majority—143 to 2. Governor Greg Abbott supported it. The reason it’s not law today is because Republicans in the Texas Senate blocked it,” Talarico said.\n\nTalarico said he believes the bill’s success this session hinges on garnering support from Republican senators.\n\n“I’m hopeful that we have the support this time around in the state Senate to pass this bill. This is a bipartisan, broadly supported measure that can save lives in Texas,” Talarico said. “We’ve got to do everything we can to get this through the state House, through the state Senate, and passed by the governor.”\n\nTalarico also outlined his strategy to overcome this obstacle: “We’re going to try to organize Texans to reach out to their Republican state senators and demand that we pass this life-saving measure.”\n\nDespite the roadblocks in Texas, fentanyl test strips are available online, selling for about a dollar per strip. However, due to Texas’ current laws, the strips cannot be shipped to the state.\n\n“We have an addiction crisis in this state and in this country,” he said. “It doesn’t make any sense. We could be saving lives with this simple measure if we just make the decision to legalize these test strips.”", "source_domain": "www.reportingtexas.com"}

The frustration level is palpable across the state.”\n\nThe medication-assisted treatment program, or MAT, launched last year to help jails respond to the opioid crisis by allowing them to offer anticraving medications — such as injections of the opioid-blocker Vivitrol — along with counseling to help stem overdose deaths.\n\nThe program also aims to increase community safety by reducing recidivism and can help people with opioid addiction get treatment in jail and after their release, Felix said.\n\nColorado’s Behavioral Health Administration, which works to ensure Coloradans can access to mental health and addiction services, said jails must adjust their budgets or find alternative funding to sustain their medication-assisted treatment programs, leaving many facilities uncertain about the future of their services, especially rural ones. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nSince 2011, the state has required jails to provide mental health and substance use disorder services through a program called Jail Based Behavioral Health Services. In 2023, jails were required to add the medication-assisted treatment program to their existing behavioral health services.\n\nJails recently received money from the state to continue running jail-based behavioral health services but won’t get any more state or federal funding, so far, to help continue running the new medication-assisted treatment portion of the program, Felix said.\n\nThe Delta County Jail received $380,000 from the state this fiscal year for its behavioral health services and $20,000 from federal grants to start the opioid treatment program.\n\nThe Behavioral Health Administration said jails should pull funds from their behavioral health services budgets to help fund the medication-assisted treatment program until a permanent solution can be found.\n\nJails can request opioid settlement money or other funding from their county leaders, the Behavioral Health Administration said.\n\nThe state Medicaid program is exploring other solutions such as one that would allow it to seek a federal waiver to provide medication-assisted treatment for Medicaid-eligible people up to 90 days before their release.\n\n“This would provide a long-term solution to cover jail based medication-assisted treatment costs, but if enacted, would still be a few years away from adding support,” Busch wrote in the email.\n\nDiverting funds to pay for other substance use services\n\nIf the Delta County Jail is unable to find alternative funding for its opioid treatment, leaders there will have to do what the Behavioral Health Administration suggested and divert funding from other key services, Felix said.\n\n“The other end of jail-based behavioral health services is going to suffer because we’ll be pulling funds from those essential services to remain legally in compliance with state regulations for medication-assisted treatment,” she said. “The jails will suffer but not as much as the inmates will.”\n\nBunk beds at the Delta County Jail are seen March 28, 2024. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nThe behavioral health services program provides mental health support, clothing, help obtaining identification cards, cellphones and assistance with obtaining emergency housing after their release, Felix said, and those benefits may have to be removed or reduced to help fund the treatment program.\n\n“There will have to be some cutbacks on staffing or salaries or programming services,” Felix added.\n\nWith the medication-assisted treatment program in its first year, it is unclear how much funding is needed to run it, Felix said.\n\nThe cost of the program depends on the size of the jail and what percentage of the incarcerated population receives medication-assisted treatment, a number that changes sometimes daily, Busch wrote in an email.\n\nIt currently costs about $859 per person per week to receive medication-assisted treatment at Delta County Jail, Felix said.\n\nFelix estimates it will cost about $87,000 to provide that treatment this upcoming fiscal year. Currently, she has about $12,000 left to administer the program before the money is spent by the end of June.\n\nThe Behavioral Health Administration is partnering with state agencies to find funding, and jails can explore grants to help fund the state’s MAT program.\n\n“BHA is committed to working with jails to support identifying other funding streams to keep this vital service afloat,” Busch wrote.\n\nAddressing a lack of funding for medication-assisted treatment in jails across the state is a priority for the attorney general’s office, Lawrence Pacheco, a spokesperson for the AG’s office wrote in an email to The Sun this week.\n\nThe attorney general announced an award program in January that would allow people to nominate jails that could receive one-time $50,000 grants to help the facilities continue running the opioid treatment program.\n\nA women’s pod-style unit is seen at the Delta County Jail March 28, 2024. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nJails: De facto medical and mental health treatment providers\n\nLaw enforcement officials have long argued that people with addiction and mental illness should receive treatment from community-based providers who are better trained and more suited to take care of them, said Capt. Daniel Cano Jr., Delta County Jail administrator.\n\nBut jails have become de facto treatment providers for people with mental illness and substance use disorders because of underfunded and disorganized mental health services in the community, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nState and local governments shut down mental health hospitals during the deinstitutionalization movement from 1955 to 1980 but failed to provide adequate alternatives, according to the advocacy organization.\n\nNow people who are repeatedly arrested are often people of color, others living in poverty, people with low education, those who are unemployed and others who have serious unmet medical and mental health needs, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.\n\nThe Colorado Sun visited the Delta County Jail on March 28.\n\nCameras in the jail’s control room at one point showed one man with mental illness repeatedly pacing from one corner in his small cell to the other.\n\n“He will do that for hours at a time,” a guard told a Sun reporter.\n\nThe medical facility, where people are seen for medication-assisted treatment and other health concerns, is next to padded cells where people who are a harm to themselves or others are held until medical staff release them.\n\nThe Delta County Jail on March 28, 2024.

(Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nOthers who are in withdrawal are monitored while they detox from substances in another small room nearby that has lights that never turn off.\n\nAt the Delta County Jail, which can house just over 80 people, people are given two blankets and a mattress with no sheets nor pillows — to help prevent self-harm and suicide.\n\nTypically, about 65% of people incarcerated there are receiving behavioral health services, Felix said. Of those participants, just over 20% are enrolled in the medication-assisted treatment program.\n\n“We want to turn these people back into society knowing that those cravings are taken care of in here, so they don’t go right back out and use, and eventually overdose and die,” Felix said.\n\nChelsea Herrera, 25, who was incarcerated at the Delta County Jail several times last year, said medication-assisted treatment gave her a chance to recover and heal.\n\n“Once you’re in the drug world, you get stuck there and you lose hope,” Herrera said Tuesday. “But once you start the medication-assisted treatment program, it gives you hope, so that you don’t need street drugs to continue to get through your life.”\n\nPeople with alcohol addiction can also benefit from the program by receiving a Vivitrol shot once per month, Herrera said.\n\nHerrera also participated in therapy while she was in the program and said she didn’t comply with medication-assisted treatment until she was also able to receive grief counseling inside the jail.\n\nIn 2020, Herrera got into a car wreck and accidentally killed her grandmother. Soon after, she said she began abusing alcohol.\n\nBut grief counseling at the jail helped her find a new desire to address not only her addiction but also the trauma from the deadly crash.\n\nNow, she works at a local bar in Alamosa, goes to counseling and takes medications. She’s out of jail, and has been sober for five months now.\n\n“I’m doing really well,” Herrera said. “I’m able to work at a bar without having cravings, which feels really good. I feel free.”\n\nA library is seen at the Delta County Jail. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nTreatment to help reduce deaths and recidivism\n\nMany women are incarcerated because of trauma and addiction and if they receive therapy in jail, their chance of relapsing or committing new crimes sharply drops, said Lew Swarthout, a mental health and medication-assisted treatment provider and owner of Milestone Psychiatry, who prescribes medications at the Delta County Jail.\n\n“If you don’t treat them, they’re going to come back to jail,” he said. “There’s so much fentanyl out there and it’s so cheap that they’ll have a bad day and end up relapsing.”\n\nThe need for medication-assisted treatment programs in jails and prisons is great, because drugs are very much present inside of correctional facilities, he said, the result of smuggling that jails and prisons all over have failed to curb.\n\n“People steal to buy drugs and when they’re in prison, there’s more drugs there than on the streets,” Swarthout said. “Their families send them money and then they buy drugs with it. It’s a huge epidemic. Men’s prisons have a lot of gangs set up and many of these facilities will hire former inmates to try to give them a chance. It could be former inmates, their family and corrections officers who bring drugs in.”\n\nA former visiting room is seen at the Delta County Jail. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\nConcerns about a reduction in behavioral health services at the Delta jail come after the closure in early February of Integrated Insight Community Care, a Delta-based clinic that provided medical and mental health care to some of the most vulnerable people on the Western Slope.\n\nThe loss of services at Integrated, which cared for about 1,400 patients, is significant because many people who were released from Delta County Jail were linked to medical, mental health and addiction services there.\n\nNow that the clinic is closed, when vulnerable people are released from the jail they will be without their best option for mental health stabilization and substance use disorder recovery, Felix said.\n\n“The concern is, it takes a long time to build trust between a population that is stigmatized and punished to find a therapist that they can rely on and trust,” Felix said.\n\n“When we release these people we want them to follow up with providers and stay on their meds and if we don’t have someone to immediately refer them to, who will hold them accountable for staying on their protocol?” Felix asked.\n\nSince the medication-assisted treatment initiative began at the jail last April, just three out of 22 of the program’s participants have returned to the jail, Felix said. The three people who returned were receiving care at methadone clinics outside the jail.\n\nA common area is seen at the Delta County Jail March 28, 2024. (Olivia Sun, The Colorado Sun via Report for America)\n\n“It’s not uncommon for methadone users to continue to use other illicit drugs, so their lifestyle doesn’t change much when they are released, which is likely what contributes to the recidivism,” she said. “Zero percent recidivism is ideal but the purpose of medication-assisted treatment is harm reduction and zero overdoses is a success as well.”\n\nMany people incarcerated at the Delta jail have a mental health and substance use disorder. But there’s a small population that has both conditions as well as intellectual and developmental disabilities. They will not only need mental health and addiction treatment but other support services, including help with daily living, when they’re released, Felix said.\n\n“They’re already suffering in the community with a lack of resources and they don’t have the mental fortitude to ask for help or know who their resources are,” Felix said. “I need a bigger community base and team to ensure that, when they’re released from here, they’re getting the support they need because they’re going to need it for the rest of their lives.”", "source_domain": "coloradosun.com"}

(KKTV) - A Denver man was sentenced to 48 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempting to traffic illegal drugs to Weld County, according to the 19th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe DA said Colorado State Troopers pulled over Miguel Gutierrez-Heredia in Fruita on March 26, 2024, for going 93 mph in a 75 mph speed zone.\n\nAt the time of the traffic stop, the DA says authorities were tracking his whereabouts in connection with a drug trafficking investigation. Investigators concluded that Gutierrez-Heredia had gone to California to pick up narcotics that would eventually be distributed in Denver and Northern Colorado.\n\nDuring the traffic stop, authorities reportedly found nearly 100,000 fentanyl pills, nearly five pounds of cocaine, and more than two and a half pounds of methamphetamine in Gutierrez-Heredia’s vehicle.\n\nGutierrez-Heredia pled guilty in May to one count of conspiracy to sell or distribute fentanyl - more than 50 grams, one count of special offender - introducing or importing to the state of Colorado, and one count of possession with intent to sell or distribute methamphetamine - more than 14 grams but less than 225 grams.\n\n“At the time of this interception, this was one of the biggest fentanyl busts in the state,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Pirraglia said.\n\nDistrict Attorney Pirraglia and Deputy District Attorney Katherine Fitzgerald prosecuted this case.

None of the active cases have been decided yet.\n\n\"From my point of view on the prosecutorial end of it, it's basically one more thing we have in our toolbag to handle these types of deaths,\" Harris County DA's office's major narcotics section chief Garrett Moore said. \"The ability to prosecute this type of offense existed before, but it was tied very closely to the weight of the amount delivered.”\n\nIn 2019, 317 people died from a fentanyl overdose in Texas, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. By 2022, that number had skyrocketed to over 2,000. According to the same data, Harris County ranks number one in the state for fentanyl overdose deaths with 487 in 2022.\n\n\"When it's used in a non-medical and non-controlled environment, it very much is akin to poison,\" Moore said. \"The goal is always to get dealers, to get people who are trafficking and to make sure that they're held accountable for the trafficking they're conducting.\"\n\nMoore said the DA's office also has programs for those who are believed to be addicted to fentanyl, or other dangerous drugs.\n\n\"There's a delineation, both factually, within our office and legally, between possession and possession with intent or delivery,\" he said. \"We’ve got programs like RIC [Reintegration] Court here that are designed to help people who are recovering and are dealing with addiction issues. Then there's major narcotics, which is my section, that handles the fentanyl ... people who are dealing this stuff to turn a profit as a living.\"\n\nAlthough Moore said he doesn't directly keep up with the local statistics around fentanyl prosecutions, he has personally seen an uptick recently in the number of eligible cases.\n\n\"In terms of the cases we're seeing that are being investigated, [that] are being tied back to dealers — whether they're being charged or not — that is going up anecdotally,\" he said. \"I think it's partially because of evolving investigative techniques that officers on the front lines of this are dealing with these cases [that are] becoming more and more common. Then, I guess in terms of public awareness, people are more aware of fentanyl ... which gives us the ability to have more viable prosecution.\"\n\nIn July, the Biden Administration announced several new tactics to try and combat the influx of fentanyl into the country. In the announcement, the White House said it would call on federal agencies to increase penalties on fentanyl traffickers.\n\nSome organizations, like the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), have pushed back against this approach. In a statement responding to the White House's proposed solutions, Maritza Perez Medina, the director of federal affairs at DPA, said similar proposals have not worked.\n\n\"The Administration is doubling down on the same failed drug war tactics of the past, rather than prioritizing the public health strategies that will actually save lives,\" she said. \"We know that supply-side strategies and criminalization only exacerbate negative health outcomes and create further barriers to treatment, housing, and stability.\"\n\nPerez continued in her statement and said that the focus should include more research into health services.\n\n\"With thousands of lives at stake, it is imperative for the Administration and Congress to focus on evidence-based solutions that save lives, rather than disproven tactics as a false promise of change,\" she said.", "source_domain": "www.houstonpublicmedia.org"}

At the top of the chopping block is a nearly $18 billion deficit for the National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nAs part of the proposal, the agency will maintain $27 billion for research, the administration notes that the cuts were propelled by the NIH’s “wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.” The cuts will consolidate what Trump sees as redundant programs into five new areas of research, including a National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\nThe administration also suggests cutting nearly $3.6 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), $1.7 billion from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), more than $1 billion from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and $129 million from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recommendations propose the CDC maintain $4 billion. Still, the potential budget cuts propel the consolidation of funding for several health issues, including opioids and infectious diseases, into a single grant program with $300 million in funding.\n\nWhile the budget recommends that SAMHSA retain $5.7 billion for its research and activities, it will be absorbed into a new entity dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America. The document specifically demonizes how funding was used by the agency under the previous administration, criticizing that its grants “were used to fund dangerous activities billed as ‘harm reduction,’ which included funding ‘safe smoking kits and supplies’ and ‘syringes’ for drug users.”\n\nAlthough the draft proposes to cut funding to these programs, harm reduction measures like the ones mentioned have been proven through evidenced-based research by SAMHSA and HHS to “minimize negative consequences of drug use” and decrease overdoses and negative effects of substance use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AHRQ, which has historically focused on setting quality standards across health care, including for behavioral health and on efforts to integrate behavioral health into primary care for more effective mental health treatments, will become part of the new HHS Office of Strategy. The recommended $129 million in cuts will slash spending on new grants and eliminate its digital health portfolio.\n\nUnder the proposal, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lose $674 million. Yet, the administration notes that this “will have no impact on providing benefits to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries” and is strictly eliminating funding for “non-statutory, wasteful, and woke activities.”\n\nResearch funding for the National Science Foundation will be cut by $3.5 billion for what the administration has deemed “programs in low-priority areas of science,” which it cites “behavioral science” falls under.\n\nAs of May 5, attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the administration over these cuts, particularly related to how “mental health and substance use services have been completely gutted as a result of the administration’s restructuring.”\n\nSimultaneously, the Department of Health and Human Services, now overseen by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will likely receive a suggested surplus of $500 million to help the secretary carry out his Make America Healthy Again priorities to address things like an “over-reliance on medication and treatments,” according to the documents.\n\nWhile mental health and substance use funding is being slashed in other departments, interestingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs is the only other health care-related area receiving a boost in proposed budget funding. This patient population tends to be disproportionately affected by mental health and substance use issues. It will receive an additional $3.3 billion for medical care, which includes supporting veterans’ case management and support services and nearly $2.2 billion for electronic health record modernization.", "source_domain": "bhbusiness.com"}

Though Zucker described the experience as pretty miserable – he noticed Memphis always had a terrific attitude.\n\n“And so I ended up reaching out to him afterwards. And what I learned is that he had been creating personal vlogs about his experiences for like nearly a decade at that point. And he had this real desire to share his story and have his experiences just be more visible to more people. And so we ended up deciding to kind of go on this journey together,” Zucker said.\n\nOver the next five years, the two worked together to document Memphis’ experiences navigating life and love. Memphis has cerebral palsy and, in Texas, does not receive government support.\n\n“[Memphis is] an aspiring blogger and filmmaker and actor, and he’s interested in coding. He just has all of these wide-ranging interests. And he’s a romantic. And so in the film, we kind of follow him over the course of years as he pursues all of these interests, and comes of age in a universal and specific way,” Zucker said.\n\nZucker says the documentary doesn’t really come with a message. It could be seen as an intimate portrait of a person pursuing love and independence or as something more political considering one theme is Memphis’ lack of government support in Texas.\n\n“Sometimes parents really engage with this story of how to protect your child while also supporting them and letting them fly and pursue their endeavors,” Zucker said.\n\nBut, above all, Zucker hopes it’s an opportunity for people to just get to know Memphis.\n\n“I’m excited for audiences to see a complex portrayal of someone who I think in all sorts of other spaces gets reduced to something much smaller,” Zucker said. “Memphis lives a really rich life filled with conflict and all the things that make up a human experience. And so that’s the goal with the film, and I hope that lands.”\n\n“Your Friend, Memphis” is having its world premiere at the SXSW Film Festival – which runs March 11-20. The film actually features a few clips of Memphis volunteering at that same festival in 2015 so Zucker calls the premiere “a real homecoming.”", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org"}

Larson.\n\nChristle Nadia Ruiz, 22, and Ricardo Antonio Flores, 29, both of Dallas, Texas, pled guilty in October 2024 to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 40 grams or more of fentanyl. On June 26, 2025, they were each sentenced to 188 months’ confinement by United States District Judge Karen Gren Scholer.\n\nCourt documents reveal Flores and Ruiz had been living together and distributing fentanyl from a home on Ezekiel Avenue in Dallas, Texas. In February 2023, Flores delivered 1,000 fentanyl pills and another 1,000 fentanyl pills in March 2023, in exchange for $2,000 on each occasion. Thereafter, in April 2023, Ruiz received a shipment of approximately 50,000 fentanyl pills that she and Flores were planning to distribute. On that same date, while officers executed a search warrant at their home, Ruiz attempted to flush several fentanyl pills down the commode.\n\nAccording to agents’ testimony, Ruiz had also received approximately 10,000 fentanyl pills about three to four weeks before the execution of the search warrant and that she used a social media account with the phrases “Happy vibes . . . Thug Paradise” to advertise the sale of fentanyl. Agents also testified that the street value of one fentanyl pill is $10 in the Dallas, Texas, area. The estimated street value of 60,000 pills is $600,000.\n\n“As we pointed out to the Court during the defendants’ sentencing hearings, tens of thousands of tragic overdose deaths occur each year due to fentanyl, and those who distribute it know exactly what they are doing,” said Acting United States Attorney Nancy Larson. “The staggering amount of fentanyl in this case would have caused far-reaching devastation to our families and community, but for the tremendous efforts of our law enforcement partners in apprehending these defendants and keeping this deadly poison off the streets. We are resolved to relentlessly pursue these offenders and seek the lengthy prison sentences they deserve.”\n\n“This sentence sends a clear message that those who profit from poisoning our communities with fentanyl will be held accountable,” said Eduardo A. Chavez, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Dallas. “Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has caused thousands of overdose deaths and devastated communities across the nation. The investigation and sentence handed down in this case reflects an unwavering resolve by law enforcement to protect public safety and pursue justice for the victims of the opioid epidemic.”\n\nThe case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Rockwall County Sheriff’s Department, the Rockwall Police Department, the Garland Police Department, the Hunt County Sheriff’s Office, and the Flower Mound Police Department. Special assistance was provided by the Texas Department of Public safety during the execution of the search warrant. The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney George Leal.\n\n", "source_domain": "www.justice.gov"}

I am so proud and thankful for the collaborative safety initiatives that our pharmacy teams lead every day.”\n\nOne way that pharmacists continue to improve patient care is through antimicrobial stewardship, a coordinated program to promote appropriate antibiotic use. Pharmacists work closely with nurses, physicians and other colleagues to monitor use and provide recommendations to reduce inappropriate prescribing. This results in shorter hospital stays for our patients and safeguards our community from multidrug resistant organisms.\n\nAs medication experts, pharmacists also play a key role in combating the opioid crisis. HCA Healthcare pharmacists are armed with three types of technology to optimize clinician communication and to minimize opioid overuse and diversion:\n\nElectronic Prescription for Controlled Substances (EPCS) : EPCS allows providers to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions to a pharmacy.\n\n: EPCS allows providers to electronically transmit controlled substance prescriptions to a pharmacy. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) : PDMP allows providers and pharmacists to quickly perform medication history checks and monitor real-time controlled substance data, improving care and preventing patient harm.\n\n: PDMP allows providers and pharmacists to quickly perform medication history checks and monitor real-time controlled substance data, improving care and preventing patient harm. Medication Adherence and Compliance Index (MACI): Launched in the summer of 2020, MACI is an electronic platform that aggregates data to aid in the prevention of theft of dangerous controlled substances.\n\nAnnually, in coordination with local law enforcement and the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) national drug take back day, HCA Healthcare hosts national “Crush the Crisis” opioid take back events. To raise awareness about the dangers of opioid misuse and proper disposal of medications, HCA Healthcare pharmacy professionals and other colleagues invite community members to safely and anonymously dispose of unused or expired medications. Last year, HCA Healthcare facilities collected 13,523 pounds of medication at the “Crush the Crisis” events – an estimated 9.3 million doses.\n\nLearn more about this year’s “Crush the Crisis” events on Oct. 23 at hcahealthcare.com/crushthecrisis.\n\nMicheal P. Weishampel, a pharmacy technician at TriStar Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, compounds an IV medication for a patient.\n\nWorking together during COVID-19 and beyond\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, HCA Healthcare pharmacy colleagues worked to overcome logistical obstacles and develop strategies to store, administer and provide monoclonal antibody treatments and vaccinations to patients, care teams and community members. Sharing stories of success across HCA Healthcare facilities and divisions helped pharmacy teams expedite best practices for patients.\n\nWhile the roles of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians continues to evolve, HCA Healthcare remains committed to providing pharmacists with the tools and resources they need to deliver quality care and keep patients safe. Pharmacy residency programs at HCA Healthcare provide teaching and learning opportunities so pharmacists can maximize care delivery. These one- to two-year post-graduate education programs allow pharmacists to expand clinical knowledge, collaborate with healthcare teams and conduct research.\n\nMeet our pharmacy colleagues\n\nHCA Healthcare pharmacists are involved in nearly all aspects of patient care. In addition to medication therapy, pharmacists play a pivotal role in policy compliance, medication diversion, informatics and medication safety. Below, three HCA Healthcare pharmacy leaders share their career paths, day-to-day duties and how they’re working to raise the bar for healthcare everywhere.\n\nDr. Ayoub Chybli, director of pharmacy, The Medical Center of Aurora (Aurora, Colorado)\n\nDr. Ayoub Chybli, director of pharmacy at The Medical Center of Aurora, reviews COVID-19 vaccines before delivery.\n\nDr. Ayoub Chybli manages complex multi-campus clinical operations with current oversight over acute care, behavioral health, rehabilitation and outpatient pharmacies. His interest in healthcare began during his undergraduate years when he realized pharmacy offered him an opportunity to combine his passion for serving the community and helping people get well. This led him to his current position at The Medical Center of Aurora, where he continues to incorporate those ideologies and collaborate across disciplines to build effective safety processes and ensure patients have high-quality outcomes.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, Dr. Chybli took on the historic and massive task of standing up vaccine clinics for colleagues and community members. With thoughtful and effective resourcing, staffing and teamwork, Dr. Chybli brought newfound hope to many through the vaccine clinics.\n\nFor his work in vaccine distribution, Dr. Chybli earned The Medical Center of Aurora’s ‘2020 Leader of the Year Award.’ The award honors those who demonstrate extraordinary leadership, devotion, expertise and support to those around them. For Dr. Chybli, the award “means that I am surrounded by amazing leaders and colleagues that work tirelessly at the system, division and facility level. There are countless leaders that are more deserving of this award – I am happy to serve and honored to be recognized.”\n\nDr. Luu Thuy, computer order entry pharmacist, Gulf Coast Division (Houston and South Texas)\n\nDr. Luu Thuy, computer order entry pharmacist, HCA Healthcare’s Gulf Coast Division\n\nDr. Luu Thuy, PharmD, is a remote computer order entry (COE) pharmacist for HCA Healthcare’s Gulf Coast Division in Texas. In her current role, Dr. Thuy works through a clinical surveillance platform to monitor, evaluate and make recommendations to assure the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals for patient care.\n\nDr. Thuy’s interest in pharmacy began during her time volunteering at a local Buddhist temple, where she met an abbot who happened to be a retired pharmacist. She admired his compassion toward others and respected his use of pharmaceutical knowledge to help relieve physical pain and illnesses for those who did not have access to healthcare. She went on to pursue a career in pharmacy and was among the first clinical pharmacists hired to pioneer a decentralized clinical pharmacy model at the University of Arizona Medical Center.\n\nAfter accumulating clinical experience in Arizona for 13 years, Dr. Thuy relocated to Houston and joined HCA Healthcare’s Gulf Coast Division COE pharmacy department. “My role allows me to expand my clinical experience while catching and correcting medication errors before reaching our patients, and tailoring drug therapy to meet individual patients’ needs,” Dr. Thuy said. “Medication interventions require me to regularly communicate and collaborate with providers, onsite pharmacists, nurses and patients. I enjoy being part of the interdisciplinary medical team that strives to carry out HCA Healthcare’s mission.”\n\nJamie Birth, medication reconciliation technician, North Florida Regional Medical Center (Gainesville, Florida)\n\nJamie Birth, a pharmacy technician at North Florida Regional Medical Center, conducts a medication reconciliation with a patient.\n\nJamie Birth works with a team of technicians to complete medication reconciliation for all patients admitted to her hospital, ensuring care team members have an accurate understanding of their patients’ medications.\n\nIn August 2021, the North Florida Regional Medical Center team recorded more than 1,700 medication reconciliations, of which 342 Jamie completed herself.

Claudia’s son, Camillo, had suffered an accident while at daycare.\n\nHe was seated on a toy stool. Suddenly, mysteriously, he collapsed. Claudia was at work when she got the call. She dropped everything and drove to the daycare. As soon as she saw her son, she knew something was wrong. They rushed him to the Emergency Room at Texas Children’s Hospital.\n\n“It was terrifying,” Claudia remembers. “Camillo was just a baby. At the ER, he fell asleep. When he woke up, his face was drooping, and his right side seemed to be paralyzed. They decided to do an MRI.”\n\nDoctors broke the news that Camillo had suffered a stroke.\n\n“They took him directly to the Intensive Care Unit,” said Claudia. “He had bleeding in his brain, and they had to keep him in the ICU for ten days or so. Those were the worst ten days of my life.”\n\nClaudia is an International Business Development Specialist at Texas Children’s Hospital, and she knew her son was in good hands. “I felt grateful to be part of the team at Texas Children’s. I have been working here for 27 years. As a mother, it was very comforting to know that Camillo was being seen by our doctors, by Texas Children’s doctors, who are the very best doctors in the nation.”\n\nAlthough Texas Children’s saved Camillo’s life, the stroke caused damage to his developing brain.\n\nEventually, Camillo was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.\n\nWhat is cerebral palsy?\n\nCerebral palsy is a broad term for a group of conditions that affect muscle tone, movement and posture. Typically, cerebral palsy is caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain — most often before birth. Cerebral palsy has a wide range of clinical severity with some children having only mild coordination, strength or tone difficulties while others have significant deficits and limitations.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of cerebral palsy?\n\nSymptoms of cerebral palsy vary greatly from person to person and can include:\n\nPoor coordination\n\nUnsteady gait\n\nTremors\n\nStiff or weak muscles\n\nExaggerated reflexes\n\nInvoluntary motions\n\nAbnormal movements of the hands, feet, arms, or legs\n\nIntellectual disability\n\nSeizures\n\nProblems with vision, hearing or speech\n\nChanges in the spine\n\nJoint problems\n\nWhile there's no cure, treatments can help improve motor skills and communication abilities. There are several types of cerebral palsy, including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic and mixed.\n\nThe three main types are:\n\nSpastic : muscle tightness and spasms\n\n: muscle tightness and spasms Dyskinetic : issues with muscle control\n\n: issues with muscle control Mixed: features of both the spastic and dyskinetic types\n\nPlaying sports with cerebral palsy\n\nImage\n\nFourteen-year-old boy improves athletic abilities at the Texas Children’s Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory and pursues dream of one day competing in the Paralympic Games.\n\nCamillo is now 14 years old. “Honestly, when I hear about what happened to me, I’m just grateful to be alive,” he said. “I’m happy that I can still walk and do some of the normal things that other people can do. And I’m so grateful for everything that Texas Children’s has done to help me.”\n\nThanks to his physicians, therapists, biomechanists and exercise physiologists at the Texas Children’s Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory, Camillo can do much more than walk.\n\nHe is a talented athlete who plays more than six sports competitively.\n\n“I play football, basketball, track and field, tennis, soccer and swimming,” said Camillo. “In football, I’m a kicker and defensive end. And I run the 100 and 200-meter races in track and field.”\n\nMotion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory\n\nThe Texas Children’s Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory, where Camillo is a patient, is a major part of the hospital’s nationally-ranked Orthopedics program and one of the only pediatric labs of its kind in the state. It is a hallmark feature of Texas Children’s Hospital The Woodlands, a 548,000-square-foot full-service pediatric hospital.\n\nLeveraging the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of physicians, therapists, biomechanists and exercise physiologists — along with state-of-the-art computer and sensor technology — the Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory studies, analyzes and helps improve how the human body moves. The laboratory is equipped with a 3D motion capture system, force platforms, a force plate instrumented treadmill, an electromyography system and a metabolic cart.\n\nOne lab. Two tracks.\n\nThe Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory serves two different patient groups with two different clinical focuses.\n\nPatients who have been referred for Clinical Gait Analysis typically have a movement disorder or underlying medical condition, like Camillo’s, affecting their ability to walk. Clinical gait analysis is used to inform decisions about surgical interventions and/or the need for braces/prosthetic devices to address these movement-related issues. Patients with a variety of neuromuscular or musculoskeletal conditions including cerebral palsy, spina bifida, brain or spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophies, hip and joint problems or balance disorders come for Clinical Gait Analysis.\n\nPatients who have been referred for Sports Performance are typically athletes with injuries or issues related to athletic performance or specific functions, such as running or throwing. Physical therapists and sports medicine physicians use a wide range of functional and diagnostic assessments to inform the athlete’s training and recovery regimens.\n\n“At the lab, Texas Children’s is helping to strengthen my right leg — we’re doing a lot of leg presses, squats and jumping,” said Camillo. “Because of my condition, my right side will never be as strong as my left side, but they are helping me compensate for my disability and do better at sports.”\n\nParalympic dreams\n\n“One of my main goals for the future is to get to the point where I can compete in the Paralympics,” said Camillo. “That’s the great thing about the lab at Texas Children’s — the doctors really care about me, and they want to make my life better and to help me pursue my dreams.”\n\nWhen asked what advice he would give to other patients who are facing similar challenges, Camillo says, “Never give up on what you want to do in life and keep working hard, because eventually it will pay off. I want to encourage people not to give up on their dreams. My dream is to compete in the Paralympics, partly because it could help me inspire other people with disabilities like mine. And thanks to my doctors at Texas Children’s Hospital, I can say that it’s possible.”\n\nLearn more about the nationally-ranked Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Program at Texas Children’s Hospital and the Motion Analysis and Human Performance Laboratory.\n\nTo schedule an appointment, call 832-822-2778.", "source_domain": "www.texaschildrens.org"}

Workforce development: Provide a roadmap for students to get stacking degrees (i.e., certification followed by associates and bachelors). This initiative will be through the CU Anschutz health science programs and community behavioral health programs. Every student in the Hummingbird Initiative will also have the opportunity to enroll in a certified nurse assistant (CNA), medical assistant (MA) or emergency medical technician (EMT) program, each of which is often required for entry level positions in behavioral health. Further, other trainings will be offered to students, such as Mental Health First Aid, Trauma-Informed Care, Substance Use Disorders and Opioid Addiction and Narcan Use.\n\n“By providing early exposure, mentorship programs, trainings and so much more for Colorado’s teens, we will increase the possibility of a more diverse workforce. Further, this will reduce the academic achievement gap in high school to propel students into pursuing careers in the behavioral health field,” said Katie Bakes, MD, an emergency physician at the Rocky Mountain Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who will also work on the initiative.\n\nWhat is behavioral health? The American Medical Association defines behavioral health generally as referring to “mental health and substance use disorders, life stressors and crises, and stress-related physical symptoms. Behavioral health care refers to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of those conditions.\"\n\nThe initiative was made possible by the BHA.\n\n“The BHA is committed to strengthening and diversifying the behavioral health workforce, and one of the best ways we can do that is by inviting our emerging workforce to step up and step in. We are thrilled to partner with CU Anschutz to expand opportunities for greater numbers of youth throughout the state and develop future providers,” said Wendy Simmerman, BHA’s Director of Workforce Development.\n\nThe BHA will provide $4.2 million from Fiscal Year 2023 through Fiscal Year 2025 in behavioral health career pipeline funding to the Hummingbird Initiative, which aims to strengthen Colorado’s behavioral health workforce, as directed by Senate Bill 22-181. This funding comes from Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds appropriated to the BHA from Senate Bill 22-181 and SAMHSA Supplemental Mental Health and Substance Use Block Grant funds.\n\nModeled after a successful program\n\nThe Hummingbird Initiative is modeled after a national coalition called FACES for the Future. CU Anschutz implemented this program, calling it Denver FACES, at Manual High School in fall of 2017. Since starting Denver FACES, all students participating in the program at Manual High School have graduated, compared to an overall school graduation rate of 69%. At the time of graduation, over 90% of participants intend to pursue a career in the health profession and continue directly into post-secondary pathways, including college, certification programs or employment.\n\nThis program also aligns with the successful longtime efforts of CU Anschutz, providing early exposure and pathway programming to diverse and BIPOC youth (Black Indigenous People of Color) led by Dominic Martinez, EdD, assistant vice chancellor for the Office of Education Initiatives and Career Pathways.\n\n“This initiative addresses socioeconomic challenges that have stalled progress in creating a more diverse behavioral health workforce. In Colorado and across the country, there’s a significant disparity and lack of representation in this field. We’re not only providing a better chance for a more diverse future but we’re also providing mental health services to a population less likely to have access,” said Regina Richards, PhD, MSW, vice chancellor at CU Anschutz’s Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Community Engagement.\n\nThe program will start in high schools beginning in the fall of 2023 and will include an application process for students and in-classroom teaching and trainings to set students up for success in future healthcare careers.\n\n“Growing up, I didn’t see healthcare providers that looked like me. This program is meaningful because I see a reflection of myself in the students,” said Chawtana Edwards, FACES for the Future Denver Program Manager.\n\nRachel Davis, MD, associate professor at the CU Department of Psychiatry, adds, “I’m very excited about this initiative because I grew up in rural Southeastern Colorado and my experience as a CNA and EMT in my town of 800 people introduced me to medicine and set me down the path of ultimately becoming a psychiatrist.\"\n\nAbout the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus\n\nThe University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus is a world-class medical destination at the forefront of transformative science, medicine, education and patient care.

These challenges unfortunately trickle down, creating cumbersome administrative burdens and patient care delays. Meanwhile, the lack of consistent BH data standards poses a major barrier to the exchange of information across stakeholders.\n\nThese issues are so universal, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have committed more than $20 million over the next three years toward addressing them. Through a series of SAMHSA grants focused on substance use treatment and mental health services, the initiative will identify a set of BH data interoperability standards (USCDI+), making it easier for providers to measure, evaluate and report on the care they provide.\n\nSponsored Post The Definitive Guide to Medical Billing Outsourcing: 5 Top Companies In today’s healthcare landscape, your choice of medical billing partner directly impacts your bottom line. What are the best medical billing outsourcing companies, and which one is right for you?\n\nThese standards will be critical to advancing BHIT interoperability. But while states and providers alike look forward to a more consistent approach to data collection and management, many are still unsure of how we’ll get there. Even with standardized criteria, providers and states all operate in a wide range of technological sophistication and capabilities. The tools they use likewise employ various processes, data and file types.\n\nVariation in capacity, resources and infrastructure will make these standards challenging to implement nationwide. While providers and administrators struggle to identify the best next step to meet new standardization rules, they need a strategy tailored to the intricacies of their program, based on their specific data workflows — which might look vastly different state to state.\n\nDesigning a tailored BHIT solution\n\nFor public health programs to succeed in interoperability, they must understand their specific pain points and capacity for change. For instance, in Colorado, the Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) identified a barrier in its mission to provide comprehensive, equitable and accessible behavioral health services to its citizens: medication-assisted treatment (MAT) admissions.\n\nAlthough Colorado had services readily available to help its population, the intake process was cumbersome. Administrators had to manually collect information and match behavioral health needs to resources, causing patients to sometimes wait for days to be enrolled in a life-saving treatment program. The existing process did not consider the various formats of data sources needed for this undertaking: PDFs, proprietary MAT registries, spreadsheets and more.\n\nWhile Colorado was using some technologies available to them, the tools were not cohesive, causing delays with the intake process for providers, patients and state administrators.\n\nOnce they identified this acute challenge, the BHA worked with their public health technology partner, to understand the state of current workflows and technological need . Thus, the state’s centralized registry was born.\n\nDesigned to streamline data collection and automate patient intake and program matching, the MAT registry enables decision support, automatically de-duplicates patient records and normalizes data from existing disparate sources to create a more impactful reporting and analytics process.\n\nConversely, organizations in Michigan are utilizing technology to increase access to behavioral health directly to patients. Family Health Care, a Federally Qualified Health Center, leveraged virtual health solutions in Mecosta, Missaukee, Newago, and Wexford counties to expand access to substance use disorder and opioid use disorder treatments. These counties are not only facing a provider shortage, but many patients reside in areas where lack of public transportation poses a significant barrier to access. By offering treatment via telehealth, transportation and geographic location were eliminated from the equation entirely, allowing more patients to receive the care they need.\n\nThe Upper Peninsula of Michigan faced its own set of challenges. Long travel distances, lack of health literacy and a substantial shortage of psychiatric care providers made access to behavioral health burdensome for patients. Great Lakes Recovery Center collaborated with a digital platform to connect Medicare, Medicaid and MI Health Plan members to their care teams. By leveraging the virtual health platform, patients can now set appointments, receive notifications and reminders, and flag their needs to providers. Similarly, providers were able expand their care and impact outside of their offices allowing them to follow up on appointments and send alerts and treatment information directly to patients.\n\nColorado and Michigan are prime examples of areas that took time to examine barriers and implement dedicated solutions to better serve patients and staff. But what works well in one state or county might not necessarily solve every BHIT need across the rest of the nation.\n\nAddressing the full BHIT spectrum\n\nWhile one state might have a lot to learn from its neighbors’ approach to BHIT, the administration that tries to copy directly from another state’s data playbook will likely wind up with an ill-fitted strategy that doesn’t suit their program long-term. One-size-fits-all solutions simply can’t address all the nuances across this wide range of technological capabilities and BH complexities.\n\nThat’s why, for this new SAMHSA/ONC initiative to work — and for BH data exchange to mature overall — new IT solutions must be tailored to fit the unique needs of each state health administration and its provider partners. Understanding and addressing the entire tech spectrum of these groups will ensure that new solutions alleviate, rather than exacerbate, the administrative and interoperability burdens they face.\n\nFor example, BH entities with limited technological capabilities need simple digital front-end solutions to replace cumbersome paper-based processes, with solutions like automated SAMHSA reporting. Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum, those with more sophisticated IT systems need a robust solution that connects the dots between existing digital tools to help manage integrations and streamline data exchange across platforms.\n\nWhile there’s no singular playbook to guide the path toward BHIT interoperability, state administrators and healthcare providers must be willing to collaborate with the experts to tailor their approach to data exchange. Ultimately, a standardized approach will eventually run into issues in a space as complex and nuanced as behavioral health itself. Although taking the time to design a customized solution might seem daunting, it’s the only path to sustained success for interoperability initiatives across our 50 united, but unique, states.\n\nDisclaimer: The author’s employer is a public health technology partner for the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration (BHA).\n\nPhoto: erhui1979, Getty Images\n\nCarter Powers Carter Powers is both Dimagi’s Managing Director of the United States Health Division as well as Dimagi’s Co-President as the chair of Dimagi’s Executive Committee.

The development will also include a chapel, medical clinic, cafe, mental health clinic and counseling areas. It will serve people in need of long-term services, including seniors and those with physical and cognitive disabilities.\n\nPriscilla Rice / KERA A one-bed, one-bath tiny home will be about 390 square feet. The neighborhood will have 500 units.\n\nA one-bath, one-bedroom, one-bathroom tiny home is approximately 390 square feet. Each unit will be fully furnished, and many of the homes will include ramps instead of stairs.\n\n“This project is going to serve really our most vulnerable homeless neighbors,” said Juliana Williams, chief advancement officer for OurCalling.\n\n“It's not a project for anyone who might need to transition off the streets,” she said. “It's going to be a community of support and care for neighbors that are elderly, that are disabled that may have cognitive challenges or need long term supported therapeutic care.”\n\nWilliams said the homes will be for people who need to live out the rest of their days in dignity.\n\nThe nonprofit will identify potential future residents through its outreach center in Dallas, where they serve about 300 to 500 people a day, according to Williams. Community partners in Ellis County, where the neighborhood will be located, will help them identify people who would benefit from this model.\n\nWayne Walker, the CEO and pastor for the organization , said they researched more than 60 tiny home communities around the country to put the best pieces together and learn the best practices from them. Similar developments are in the works in Denton and Fort Worth, and a tiny home community in Austin serving formerly unhoused individuals is looking to expand from 370 residents to 500.\n\n“The level of support services we're going to be providing here on site does seem to be pretty unique,” Walker said. “All those services are onsite so that people won't have to leave to take care of themselves. It's a place where they're able to live for the rest of their lives.”\n\nThe $15 million raised for Phase I will cover the land purchase, land improvements and master plans. The funding came from private donors. The first 25 homes should be complete by this spring.\n\nPriscilla Rice is KERA’s communities reporter. Got a tip?

(AP File Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nAURORA | Someone near you starts to show signs of an opioid overdose. Then they stop breathing. That person has six minutes before their brain cells start to die.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nSix minutes is barely enough time to call 911 and for the emergency responders to arrive in time.\n\nSay you are in a busy place. That gives you six minutes to find someone who can help. Now, consider that person is not just a stranger, but a loved one—a cousin, a sibling, a parent or even your child.\n\n“I can’t, I can’t put words to what it has felt like to lose a son to something that he experimented with,” Anthony Alvarado said about his son, who died from fentanyl poisoning after he experimented with Percocet that he didn’t know was laced with fentanyl.\n\nSomeone administering naloxone to his son could have saved his life.\n\nAurora is considering installing one or more naloxone vending machines, paid for by outside funding for opioid overdose prevention, but some city lawmakers fear it could promote drug use.\n\n“I just want to make sure we’re not promoting any sort of, you know, safe injection sites, and for me, that kind of teeters on that,” Councilmember Danielle Jurinsky said during a May city council meeting about a plan to procure the vending machines.

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)\n\nThe city is on track to receive more than $3.4 million over the next 17 years as part of Colorado’s share of national opioid settlement funds to help combat the opioid crisis, and naloxone — also known as the brand name Narcan — vending machines were one prevention proposal.\n\nLocal, regional and national public health officials say naloxone has become an important tool in pushing back rising numbers of opioid overdose. Denver has installed the vending machines in hospitals and, most recently, police stations.\n\nAs stronger forms of opioids continue to flood the black market and can now be found in a variety of other drugs such as marijuana, Percocet, cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine, opioid overdoses have greatly spiked in the last five years, and only began reducing after Colorado took strong preventive measures, according to state health officials.\n\n“During the global pandemic, my son found himself in isolation and disconnection, and even knowing all of the education and support in those moments of struggle, in those moments of not being willing to ask for help, in those moments of unknowing,” Alvarado said.\n\nHe said the fentanyl-laced Percocet took his son’s life at 17.\n\n“That completely turned our life upside down,” he said.\n\nAlvarado is the founder of Rise Together, a youth empowerment program founded to break the stigma and silence around mental health and addiction. He was previously an addict who became an advocate for addiction recovery before his son died, and he said he actively modeled education for his son, never imagining it would happen to his own family.\n\n“I was joining stages with mothers who have lost children,” he said. “I could have never imagined that I was going to be sitting in the same group that they are, and I’m now a grieving parent who has lost a child. Young people deserve access to this education, and young people are not the only ones dying.”\n\nHe said that the nation’s elderly are also dying at much higher rates from unintentional fentanyl overdoses. Several university and government research sources say that overdoses among Americans over 65 have quadrupled over the past decade.\n\nOverdoses in all age groups spiked during the pandemic and only recently started to decrease again, after mass education, reduced stigma and naloxone availability became more common practice.\n\nThe age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths nationwide increased from 8.9 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2003 to 32.6 in 2022, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate decreased to 31.3 in 2023. Those rates decreased between 2022 and 2023 for people ages 15–54, but increased for adults aged 55 and older.\n\nColorado had similar numbers, showing a minor increase in overdose deaths from 1,799 in 2022 to 1,865 in 2023, according to the Colorado Center for Health and Environmental Data. There was a more significant increase in opioid-related deaths from 1,160 in 2022 to 1,292 in 2023. All of the younger age groups decreased from 2022 to 2023, but all age groups older than 35 years increased in overdose deaths during that time.\n\nOf the opioid related deaths in 2023, 311 occurred in Adams and Arapahoe Counties, and an additional 39 in Douglas County, totaling 350 lives in all three counties, an increase of 30 deaths from 2022.\n\nThere were 442 non-fatal opioid overdose-related emergency department visits in Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas Counties in 2023, Calli Tucker, Aurora’s Crisis Intervention Program administrator, said during a study session in April.\n\nIt means those three counties had more people who were saved from overdoses than people who died.\n\nA report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a 13.9% decrease in fatal overdoses in Colorado from October 2023 to October 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nThe deaths caused by synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, dropped 28.5%, from 1,192 to 852, according to the article. Colorado Consortium for Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention, which is part of CU Anschutz’s Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said that one reason the fatal overdose rate has declined is that naloxone is readily available for anyone to have.\n\n“Research showed that 73.3% of drug overdose deaths in Colorado in 2023 had at least one potential opportunity for intervention, most often by a bystander,” Tucker said during the meeting. “Which speaks to why the focus on opioid abatement fund strategies is so crucial.” FILE – The overdose-reversal drug Narcan is displayed during training for employees of the Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC), Dec. 4, 2018, in Philadelphia. Drug overdose deaths in Kentucky fell nearly 10% in 2023, marking a second straight decline in the fight against an addiction epidemic that’s far from over, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nProven Solutions\n\nWhether the person has an addiction, is using drugs recreationally or is experimenting for the first time, the first and most important step is keeping people alive to recover and move on, addiction experts say.\n\n“We can only help a person to lead a productive life if they are alive,” said Dr. Aleksandra Zgierska, professor of family and addiction medicine at Pennsylvania State University. “Only then, they can enter treatment, only then, they can learn from their mistakes, however we approach it, but it’s only under those circumstances. So keeping people alive is our primary goal.”\n\nNaloxone is an opioid overdose antidote that works by essentially bumping the opioid off key receptors in the brain, a mechanism that helps reverse overdose symptoms like slow breathing, Dr. Brandon Marshall, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University, said.\n\n“Naloxone, as a substance, is used to reverse overdose, not to prevent overdose,” Zgierska said. “People are dead unless naloxone is administered by bystanders, which means that everybody should have naloxone to help those who overdose.”\n\nNarcan is the popular brand name for naloxone. All forms of naloxone are considered safe, and naloxone can now be obtained without a prescription in every state, as mandated by law. Naloxone, as a nasal spray, can be easily administered to someone who is experiencing an overdose.\n\nBystanders who administer naloxone are advised by professionals to call 911 and, ideally, perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the person regains consciousness. If the person does not respond after three minutes, professionals recommend administering additional doses of naloxone. The need for added doses has become more common with “super fentanyl” like nitazenes, which are another form of synthetic opioids that can sometimes be more potent than fentanyl.\n\nDr. Eric Hill, the medical director for Aurora Fire and Rescue, said that there is still oxygen in the blood that can somewhat prolong the time of brain cell death. He said that administering mouth-to-mouth breathing to the person can help keep oxygen flowing to the brain. He said naloxone and mouth-to-mouth can both greatly aid emergency responders as a life-saving measure while they are en route.\n\n“In terms of Aurora Fire’s travel times, 90% of AFR’s departmentwide travel time for first-arriving apparatus for fires and medical emergencies in 2024 were within 6 minutes, 42 seconds or less,” City of Aurora spokesperson Jennifer Soules said in an email.\n\nJust because the person is conscious doesn’t mean they don’t need to see a doctor immediately. Naloxone is used to revive and stabilize the person before they are taken to the hospital or to see a doctor.\n\nThat doctor visit also provides professionals with an opportunity to discuss addiction treatment options with the patient, if it’s warranted.\n\n“Addiction is a chronic disease and requires treatment by healthcare professionals,” Zgierska said.\n\nZgierska said that an overdose gives medical professionals a better ability to speak with people face-to-face and refer them to possible treatment opportunities. Stigmatization can make it more challenging for individuals to seek help.\n\n“If we further stigmatize drug use and addiction, it’ll be harder and harder to bring people to treatment or even disclose that they have a problem,” Zgierska said.\n\nA “non-judgmental tone” is a significant factor in one of their opioid prevention campaigns, dubbed “Keep The Party Safe.”\n\nKeep The Party Safe, which is led locally by the consortium with CU Anschutz, is aimed at occasional and recreational drug users between the ages of 18 and 45 who are unaware that fentanyl can be found in drugs including cocaine, MDMA, meth and heroin. Counterfeit versions of prescription drugs, including Xanax and OxyContin, are also a danger, according to a research article from CU Anschutz.\n\n“Research shows that when naloxone is made more widely available, overdose deaths decrease,” Marshall said. “One potential barrier I want to highlight is cost. Some pharmacies may charge upwards of $50 for just one naloxone kit, which could be unaffordable to many people who might benefit from having naloxone and administering it in the case of an overdose.”\n\nZgierska and Dr. Alice Zhang, assistant professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Pennsylvania State University, is the lead author of the review on the effectiveness of naloxone vending machines with Dr. Zgierska.\n\n“One aspect of the vending machine that is not available through traditional means is that it’s available 24/7,” Zhang said. “It’s available after hours when businesses are closed. We’re seeing data from our vending machines that they’re being used from like 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., so that’s when most people aren’t typically awake.”\n\nZhang said they also found from a survey given through the smart vending machines that 38% of the people said they were getting naloxone to be prepared if they encounter an accidental overdose.\n\n“Some of the survey data that we have showed that over half of the respondents thought that the vending machine was able to help reduce stigma around addiction and naloxone,” Zhang said.\n\nTypical over-the-counter pricing for Narcan is $50 for a two-pack of nasal spray. In 2019, the state of Colorado created the Opiate Antagonist Bulk Purchase Fund, which provides free naloxone to qualifying entities. The problem is that KFF Health News reported last year that the fund is quickly depleting.\n\nOther funds are coming from legal settlements after the opioid crisis, but those funds are also limited and reserved for all opioid prevention and abatement measures.\n\nAurora is on track to receive more than $3.4 million over the next 17 years as part of Colorado’s share of national opioid settlement funds to help combat the opioid crisis.\n\nThe grant funds come from legal settlements with pharmaceutical companies, distributors and retailers found to be responsible for fueling the opioid epidemic, Tucker said during the study session.\n\nAs of 2024, $1,737,942 in opioid settlement funds have been made available to the city, with only $245,540 approved so far for vans and buses to transport people to and from the Aurora Navigation Campus. The center is Aurora’s work-first, one-stop shop facility for handling homelessness in Aurora. It’s expected to open later this year.\n\nAn agreement with the state allows expenditures to fall within specific areas, including treatment, prevention, services for children, support for first responders, community leadership, staffing and training, research and related administrative costs.\n\nAccording to Tucker, city staff proposed four initial funding projects based on the city’s history and available evidence:\n\nConsulting services to access Medicaid billing, estimated at $125,000.\n\nImplement naloxone vending/resource distribution sites, estimated at about $10,000 for each site, possibly two or more sites.\n\nExpanded emergency medical services for opioid overdoses, estimated at $112,000\n\nExpanded intervention services in response to opioid overdoses, estimated at $55,000-$87,000 per site, with possibly two sites.\n\nAlthough there has been recent national news about Medicaid funding cuts, the opioid settlement money appears to still be secure, according to city officials.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nAddiction has little to do with resolution\n\n“It does not matter what you look like, or where you’re from,” Alvarado said. “Addiction does not discriminate, and we are tired of hearing that it’s just the addict’s problem. We are people. We are humans, and we deserve respect and support, period.\n\nOne in five teens has already tried prescription drugs illegally, according to the Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse. The majority, 76% of these teenagers, buy these prescription pills illegally, according to the 17th Judicial District Fentanyl Fact Sheet.\n\n“Addiction is part of the inability to process pain,” Alverez said. “So you can address that deeper core issue, that’s where you start to see that form of recovery. But it takes a community.”\n\nThe pipeline from experimenting to misuse and addiction is not far. Repeated studies have found that in many cases, addiction behaviors can serve as coping mechanisms for physical and psychological pain, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nThrough Rise Together, Alvarado has taught more than 300,000 students about substance use and mental health. The crisis impacts people across all demographics – from high school cheerleaders to students from various socioeconomic backgrounds, according to Alvarado.\n\nAddiction is usually about underlying systemic issues like poverty, disconnection and unprocessed pain, Alvarado said. The settlement grant money the city is receiving for opioid prevention and treatment is from pharmaceutical companies taking advantage of those issues, prioritizing profits over people, and creating easily accessible addictive medications.\n\n“Don’t ever be that person who says it will never happen to you because until it impacts you personally, whether it’s a loved one, a family member, a child, a cousin, brother, uncle, sister, you name it,” Alvarado said. “The stories, while they might be different, nobody went into it thinking, oh, man, I’m going to be an addict and I’m going to die from this substance.”\n\nIf anything, being saved from an overdose can create a “cascading” effect where people who live through an overdose are more likely to become advocates who want to save other people’s lives, Zgierska said.\n\nSimilarly, having access to naloxone does not enable people to indulge in their addictions.\n\n“Research dispels concerns raised by some people in the past that naloxone’s availability may increase someone’s likelihood to take more drugs,” Zgierska said. “In fact, research confirms the opposite – lack of naloxone’s availability increases the likelihood of death.”\n\nAccording to Alvarado, communities must approach addiction with compassion, education and support. By reducing stigma and increasing access to resources such as Narcan, lives can be saved.\n\n“It’s not a matter of mental weakness,” he said. “It’s more of a matter of maybe mental fitness to be part of that conversation. It goes back to more access to education and more support for people who are struggling in the process, and that they’re experiencing life in a healthy way.”", "source_domain": "sentinelcolorado.com"}

Although the vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) are significant, it is difficult to determine the number of people impacted due to the frequent occurrence of VCID with other etiologies and comorbidities.\n\nAdvances in neuroimaging have identified a high prevalence of brain white matter damage in persons with VCID, leading to consensus that slow progressive changes in the brain related to cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) are a major mechanism involved in VCID.\n\nAdditionally, as life expectancy increases worldwide, the global burden of age-related cognitive impairment, including presumed vascular etiology, will rise. Therefore, the study authors believe that any intervention that alleviates the burden of VCID should be investigated.\n\n“Despite the pressing need to develop VCID biomarkers, only a few can reliably detect and track SVD changes leading to VCID, and these have yet to be approved by regulatory agencies to be used in clinical trials,” said Alison Luckey, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow with the Biggs Institute and first author of the study.\n\nCurrently, the most used neuroimaging marker of SVD is white matter hyperintensities (WMH). However, the etiology of WMH remains undetermined and is further suggested to not only represent vascular lesions but also neurodegeneration.\n\nEnter, PSMD\n\nThe new study notes that PSMD had shown excellent instrumental properties as a marker, meaning it showed reliability across users, sites and time points. So, the scientists set out to extend their work to perform a biological validation, defined as the association with clinically meaningful aspects of VCID, such as cognitive performance.\n\nThe UT Health San Antonio-led team studied a group of 396 participants from the MarkVCID consortium (https://markvcid.partners.org), founded from an initiative of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to identify, develop and validate fluid- and imaging-based biomarkers for the SVDs associated with VCID.\n\nFor their study, the scientists derived PSMD from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using an automated algorithm, and related it to a composite measure of general cognitive function using linear regression models adjusting for confounders.\n\n\n\nFrom that, they observed that higher PSMD was associated with lower general cognition in MarkVCID, independent of age, sex, education and intracranial volume. The findings were replicated in three independent samples. Further, PSMD explained cognitive status above and beyond WMH, the more common cerebrovascular marker.\n\n\n\nThe researchers concluded that PSMD has ideal biomarker qualities for the clinical trial pipeline across the most common form of dementias, as it is non-invasive, fully automated, fast and has excellent reliability, repeatability and reproducibility.\n\nAdditional longitudinal validation studies assessing the use of PSMD as a surrogate of cerebral small vessel diseases are underway.\n\nOther authors of the study are with the Boston Chobanian & Avidisian University School of Medicine; Boston University School of Public Health; National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health; Harvard Medical School; University of New Mexico School of Medicine; University of New Mexico; University of Kentucky; University of California at San Francisco; and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nAlso, the University of Mississippi Medical Center; Icelandic Heart Association; University of Iceland School of Health Sciences; University of California at Davis; Massachusetts General Hospital; University of Southern California; The Mind Research Network; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston; Illinois Institute of Technology; and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nUT Health San Antonio is a world-class research university, ranking at the top 5% among institutions globally for clinical medicine according to U.S. News & World Report. It is No. 12 in the world among universities for the impact of its discoveries – in normalized citation impact, which compares the number of citations its research receives per paper to the average for similar published work, a recognized core measure of research impact.\n\n\n\nBiological validation of peak-width of skeletonized mean diffusivity as a VCID biomarker: The MarkVCID Consortium\n\nAlison M.

Film producer Karin Gornick was inspired to dive into the nation’s growing rate of school-aged children being diagnosed with anxiety after trying to find help for her son.\n\nGornick’s pursuit along with Scilla Andreen, Matt Skerritt and Stephanie Riggs resulted in Angst, a documentary that follows the story of several young people sharing their journeys with anxiety.\n\n“I’m a filmmaker, but more importantly, a parent,” Gornick told about 175 people during a May 30, 2019 screening at The Health Museum presented in coordination with The Hackett Center for Mental Health and Okay to Say. May is observed as Mental Health Awareness Month.\n\n“My son was struggling with severe anxiety and it wasn’t until I started opening up to some friends that I was led to help” she said. “When we found out how treatable anxiety was, I thought, ‘Wow. We can really capture this so other parents don’t feel like they are alone and know to reach out.'”\n\nTurnout for the screening required an overflow room nearby. Gornick said the documentary is only being screened in community settings and is not available for streaming online due to potential triggers the film may cause.\n\nThe 56-minute film explores what living with anxiety is like for young people across the county. From achieving high test scores to getting into the right college or even walking into a full classroom a few minutes late, many of the children described their anxiety as debilitating.\n\nHeralded swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, has shared his struggles with mental health. He made a special visit to a young man suffering from anxiety at the end of the documentary.\n\nA panel discussion followed the screening. Marcy Melvin, professional counselor and director of program implementation for child and family policy of the Texas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute and Anna Lee Carothers, a recent University of Texas graduate and former UT chapter president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) joined Gornik to share their expertise about anxiety.\n\n“Most of you in this room and in our overflow room were probably able to see yourself or a loved one in one of the individuals talking,” Melvin said. “I love how they explained the science behind what happens with anxiety; sometimes feelings can sound like an abstract thing, but anxiety really lies in the brain.”\n\nFortunately, as the film and local experts explained, anxiety is highly treatable. Gornick and Melvin suggested reaching out to local organizations to learn more about treatment options.\n\n“Once you know you have an anxiety disorder, it’s not like living with an anxiety disorder for the rest of your life,” Gornick said. “Now that you know, it, you can name it and tame it.”\n\nVisit angstmovie.com to learn more about the film or for information about how to host a screening.", "source_domain": "www.tmc.edu"}
{"url": "https://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=62195", "title": "Welcome MAT: Physicians Debunk Skepticism of Medication-Assisted Treatment", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Austin addiction specialist Ann Marie Case, MD, frequently fields questions from other physicians about medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the combined use of medicines and counseling to treat people with substance use disorder.\n\nMany of those questions are tinged with skepticism. One of the biggest concerns fellow physicians have is that MAT just switches one addiction for another – such as using buprenorphine to treat addiction to another opioid.\n\n“That’s a huge component of the stigma that I see among my colleagues when I get phone calls or get asked to consult,” Dr. Case said.\n\nWhile the belief is unfounded, it’s understandable that physicians still think that way, says Michael Sprintz, DO, a Houston-area specialist in addiction medicine and pain medicine. Except for physicians who recently graduated from medical school, most had little or no training in those four years about how to handle a patient with a substance use disorder.\n\n“As physicians, whenever we dive into a new area we haven’t been trained in, it brings a level of anxiety because our biggest concern is keeping our patient safe,” he said.\n\nThe widespread stigma against MAT also is based on a misunderstanding about the goal of treatment for substance use disorder, Dr. Sprintz says.\n\n“The goal is not just chemical abstinence,” he said. “The primary goal is helping people develop self-awareness, skills, and tools to handle life on life’s terms – what I call ‘emotional sobriety.’… The value of medication-assisted treatment is that it helps people stick around in treatment, so they can learn all the other things that they need to learn about living a life without needing drugs or alcohol. MAT enables people to focus on something other than getting out of withdrawal or feeding an overwhelming craving that drives people to leave treatment early.”\n\nBut the stigma against medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder in particular means 86.6% of people who need this treatment are not getting it, according to a study published in the December 2022 International Journal of Drug Policy .\n\n“Most of my patients know there’s a treatment from what they’ve heard on the street from other people, not from a health care professional,” Dr. Case said.\n\nA better understanding of MAT – combined with recent changes in federal law about prescribing these medications and required physician education on the subject – will allow a much broader group of doctors not involved in addiction medicine not only to help tackle the opioid crisis but also to make sick people well again, Dr. Sprintz says.\n\n“You’ll start to see what you couldn’t see before,” he said.\n\nHow MAT works\n\nThe medications for MAT are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and extremely safe and effective, Dr. Case says. In fact, MAT is the best way to treat opioid use disorder and is now commonly referred to as MOUD, or medication for opioid use disorders.\n\n“We know [MOUD] is the standard of care for opioid use disorder,” she said. “We’ve known that since the 1970s, and we’ve known that it works.”\n\nMAT also can help patients combat the powerful addictions to alcohol and tobacco, says Austin addiction psychiatrist Carlos Tirado, MD, a member of TMA’s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health.\n\n“[The medications] reduce heavy drinking and the medical problems associated with excessive alcohol use,” he said. “And it can help people reduce and quit smoking.”\n\nThe combination of medication and counseling used in MAT is not much different from treatments for other chronic diseases, Dr. Tirado says. For instance, treating diabetes requires medication as well as counseling for weight loss and physical activity while addressing emotional and socioeconomic concerns that affect the disease.\n\n“In that way, [treating] substance use disorder is no different,” he said. “Psychosocial interventions, addressing comorbidities – be they physical or psychiatric – those are all part of what we call a plan of sustained recovery. It does require a comprehensive approach.”\n\nThe medications used in MAT normalize brain chemistry, relieve physiological cravings, and normalize body functions without the negative and euphoric effects of the substance used, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe medications fall into three broad categories, Dr. Tirado explains. Some, like buprenorphine, essentially replace a more harmful, highly addictive opioid, like heroin, with one that is longer acting and prevents physical withdrawal and craving but is much safer. Others, like naltrexone, are opioid antagonists that block the effect of the opioid or reduce the rewarding effect of alcohol. Still others create an adverse reaction to the addictive drug, the way disulfiram makes people sick after drinking alcohol, for instance.\n\nAs with many medicines, those used for MAT can be abused, Dr. Tirado says. But in the overwhelming number of cases, they’re not, and they have a great track record.\n\nSeveral studies show that compared with no treatment or treatments not involving medications, MOUD decreases overdose risk with opioids by more than 50%. The three medications used for MOUD – methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone – are consistently associated with improved health outcomes, including reduced opioid use, transmission of HIV and hepatitis C, and overdose risk, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\n“They’re either more or as effective as other treatments applied to other chronic conditions,” Dr. Tirado said.\n\n\n\nA role for all physicians\n\nCongress’ recent passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 made two important changes in the way physicians handle substance use disorder that affect MAT, and those changes may open the door for physicians not involved in addiction medicine to play a bigger role.\n\nFirst, lawmakers did away with the X waiver for prescribing buprenorphine, which required eight hours of training as well as rigid documentation for prescriptions and the potential for inspection by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents. That is already making physicians more comfortable with the idea of prescribing buprenorphine for MAT, Dr. Tirado says.\n\n“With the elimination of the X waiver for buprenorphine to prescribe, I think we’re still going to have a need for addiction specialists,” he said. “But we’ll have a lot more capacity [among other physicians] to initiate care.”\n\nSecond, the law requires a new one-time, eight-hour training on how to treat patients with opioid or other substance use disorders for all physicians registering or renewing their registration for a DEA license, starting June 27.\n\nMany physicians see the new requirement as an unnecessary burden, and the American Medical Association tried to block it. The American Society for Addiction Medicine endorsed it.\n\nDr. Sprintz argues the new rule can help nearly all physicians.\n\nVirtually all medical practices have at least some patients with undiagnosed substance use disorders, he says. Learning the basics of addiction can save physicians time and money because they’ll be able to recognize those patients and get them treated with MAT or refer them to appropriate care.\n\n“A patient with an untreated substance use disorder is a real challenge to a practice,” Dr. Sprintz said. “Being able to identify a patient with a [substance use disorder] and helping to get appropriate treatment helps the patient, the practice, and the health care system overall.”\n\nAddiction medicine specialists cannot treat all the Texas patients who need their help, especially those in rural areas with limited medical services, Dr. Tirado says. Other physicians now have a better chance to help patients with uncomplicated cases who typically have no other medical options.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org"}

Since August she's been training in family medicine at Salud Family Health Center in Fort Morgan.\n\n\"I really like the continuity of family medicine,\" Hungenburg said. \"We call it 'womb to tomb.' I like that wide age range because I like pediatrics, but I also like geriatrics. I kind of get a little bit of everything.\"\n\nIn Morgan County and the 15 other counties that make up Colorado's Eastern Plains, caregivers like Hungenburg face a difficult problem: Opioid overdose deaths are becoming more common. From 2014 to 2016 these counties had an opioid overdose death rate of 20.6 per 100,000 residents, higher than the state rate of 15.8.\n\nOne way to combat the growing crisis is through medication-assisted treatment, or MAT.\n\n\"I think it's definitely needed, especially in rural areas,\" said Hungenburg. \"If, as primary care physicians, we can provide that, we should be doing that.\"\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Sandi Garcia and Morgan Hungenburg work at Salud Family Health Center in Fort Morgan, which completed the IT MATTTRs Primary Care Practice Team Training.\n\nYoung, bright-eyed and energetic, Hungenburg has taken the required course for her waiver that allows her to prescribe MAT like buprenorphine, but there's an issue: She's the only provider where she works with it.\n\n\"Because I'm a resident, it means I'm still in training, so I have several supervising physicians,\" she said. \"I'm waiting for one of them to be able to prescribe it with me before I can start.\"\n\nFor now, that means there's no one at this Fort Morgan facility who can write the prescription, despite having a provider who meets the requirements.\n\nAn issue of people power\n\nThe lack of medical providers who can prescribe MAT is a problem not only in eastern Colorado but throughout the state - and the country. There is a nationwide push to get more medical providers waivered to write buprenorphine prescriptions, and a new study is taking the training a step further.\n\nThe three-year study is called Implementing Technology and Medication Assisted Treatment Team Training in Rural Colorado, or IT MATTTRs, and it is designed to address the needs of residents in eastern Colorado and the San Luis Valley.\n\n\"We recognize there are many different ways to approach the problem of opioid use disorder, this focuses on treatment and how to increase the capacity in rural practices and communities to be able to provide treatment because it's like a barren, barren, landscape right now,\" said Linda Zittleman, co-director of the High Plains Research Network.\n\nHPRN, based at the University of Colorado Department of Family Medicine, created the study. It is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nBefore the study began, HPRN identified only two providers with the required DEA waiver in the two regions. Their first goal is to help providers get trained and get the waiver to increase that number to 10.\n\nIT MATTTRs started in October 2016. Since then, 30 providers - at least 22 of them in eastern Colorado - have completed the prescribing waiver training. Another 17 have requested their waiver from the DEA.\n\nBut Zittleman found that getting providers trained is not enough.\n\n\"A provider goes through training, (goes) back to the practice and the rest of the team may not know how to support that,\" she said. \"They don't know the other components of medication-assisted treatment.\"\n\nEnter the second part of the IT MATTTRs program: a curriculum to teach medical practices about opioids, addiction and MAT.\n\nThe Primary Care Practice Team Training aims to better equip practices with the information and resources needed to better serve patients with opioid use disorder. The training is for the whole staff, from the front desk and medical assistants to doctors.\n\n\"One of the main things we learned is that you have no idea what an opioid-dependent or opioid-addicted person looks like.\"\n\n\"It's vital to train the entire practice team,\" said Lori Jarrell, practice facilitator and trainer with the High Plains Research Network. \"This is an issue that's complex and we all have personal and professional bias, thoughts, ideas, experiences with that.\"\n\nThe study wanted to recruit 40 health care practices to take the team training. Thus far, 42 have been recruited and 40 have completed the training. Thirty of these practices are in eastern Colorado, including Salud Family Health Center in Fort Morgan. All 50 staff members participated in the four, hour-long, sessions.\n\n\"It takes the stigma away,\" said Sandi Garcia, center director of Salud in Fort Morgan. \"One of the main things we learned is that you have no idea what an opioid-dependent or opioid-addicted person looks like.\"\n\nGetting the community involved\n\nThe High Plains Research Network was established 20 years ago and covers the 16 counties in eastern Colorado. The group works with primary care practices, hospitals, public health agencies and communities in rural eastern Colorado on a variety of research studies and programs that are relevant to and contribute to the health of people living there.\n\nAbout 15 years ago they formed a community advisory council to help guide its work. The council has worked on a variety of health issues like asthma, colon cancer, high blood pressure - and now opioid addiction and treatment.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Maret Felzien, fourth-generation rancher in Sterling, Colorado has been on the High Plains Research Network's community advisory council for 15 years.\n\nCouncil members live in the various Eastern Plains counties and are farmers, ranchers, teachers, large and small business managers, students and retirees.\n\n\"Folks who are not medically trained, they're not public health professionals but they live in eastern Colorado,\" Zittleman said. \"So they know what it's like to live there, they know how people communicate, they know what's going on in the community.\"\n\nThat community understanding is essential to the third part of IT MATTTRs, where the council developed a community-based component. They created the awareness campaign \"Have You Met MAT?\" aimed at changing the conversation around opioid addiction.\n\n\"Our work follows a pretty specific process,\" said Maret Felzien, a fourth-generation rancher and director of academic support services at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling.\n\nShe and husband, Ned Norman are members of the community advisory council.\n\n\"The first process is really beginning to understand what is the situation and what do we need to know about this health issue?\" she said.\n\nAt first the council met quarterly to get an in-depth education about opioids, addiction and treatment. Then they translated the medical information and jargon around opioid use disorder and MAT into concepts, messages and materials that are meaningful and actionable to community members.\n\n\"While there's this curriculum going on in the clinics and this education process in the clinics,\" Felzien said, \"our desire was to start to get people to see and think and hear about (medication)-assisted treatment and to talk about opioid use and abuse.\"\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC The High Plains Research Network's community advisory council created an awareness campaign aimed at changing the conversation around opioid addiction in eastern Colorado. Materials include coasters, posters and inserts for use in churches, bars, health care offices and libraries.\n\nThe \"Have You Met MAT?\" campaign launched last spring. It includes movie theater ads, newspaper articles and informational letters sent to law enforcement workers.\n\nThere are also handouts like coasters, inserts, posters and placemats. The materials are printed with images representative of the Eastern Plains - such as barns and the Pawnee Buttes.\n\n\"It's really important to our community that when we put out publications into our community that it reflects our personalities,\" Felzien said.\n\nOne of the posters features a black and white photo of a player in uniform holding a football in front of his face. In bold green and white letters it reads, \"Deaths from opioid drug overdose increase 300 percent in eastern Colorado over the past decade.\"\n\n\"I've had a lot of patients really in the last few months saying they want to get off opioids.\"\n\n\"Sports are really important to us,\" Felzien said. \"We're small towns, we're small communities, we revolve around our schools and our school's athletics. And so this is the image that looks like us. It could be one of our kids, likely is.\"\n\nMembers of the community advisory council have distributed tens of thousands of the handouts to many local establishments including churches, restaurants, bars, banks, libraries and liquor stores.\n\nBen Brunner has a poster and some inserts on display at his pharmacy in the town of Brush in Morgan County.\n\n\"I've had a lot of patients really in the last few months saying they want to get off opioids,\" he said. \"I think it's helping. It's kind of drawing attention, saying, you know, there's a problem out there and a lot of people probably shouldn't be taking these on a daily basis.\"\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Ben Brunner displays a poster from the \"Have You Met MAT?\" campaign at his pharmacy in Brush, Colorado.\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of the IT MATTTRs program, researchers will conduct pre- and post-surveys with community members, patients and primary care practice teams.\n\nBut the study has already made an impact. The Colorado Office of Behavioral Health has included the prescribing waiver training and Primary Care Practice Team Training in the state targeted response to the opioid crisis grant program.\n\nThrough the IT MATTTRs statewide dissemination efforts over 115 primary and behavioral health care practices have or will receive the team training. Also 480 providers have completed the training and about 375 have requested their waiver from the DEA.\n\n\"So what we want to do with the IT MATTTRs program,\" Jarrell said, \"(is) for people to find options and treatment available within their local communities to get whatever is that they need for care to be able to be successful in their life.\"", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org"}

While HCA Healthcare is helping combat the opioid epidemic as a whole, we are also committed to creating healthier tomorrows for our tiniest patients impacted by opioids, infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Read on to find out how the NICU Rockers program plays an important role in the non-pharmacologic management of NAS.\n\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome (also called NAS) is a group of conditions caused when a baby withdraws from certain drugs he’s exposed to in the womb before birth. Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) care for babies with NAS, who need additional support in their first days, weeks or months of life.\n\nEvery fifteen minutes, a baby is born in the United States suffering from opioid withdrawal, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nOur colleagues, communities and volunteers are bringing hope and resilience to the opioid epidemic by breaking down the stigma around substance use disorders for mothers and their unborn babies. With initiatives in surgical, emergency and other care settings, we are ensuring that our patients have access to safer, more effective pain treatment, raising awareness about the dangers of opioid addiction and providing proper disposal of these medications.\n\nNow, another spot in our commitment to curbing the tide of the opioid crisis: HCA Healthcare volunteers are providing warmth, safety and security to babies exposed to opioids in utero through the NICU Rockers program at affiliate TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nWhat is neonatal abstinence syndrome?\n\nDr. Ashraf Hamdan, neonatologist\n\n“Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) or neonatal withdrawal syndrome is a group of problems that occur in a newborn who was exposed to addictive illegal or prescription drugs while in the mother’s womb,” says Dr. Ashraf Hamdan, a neonatologist at TriStar Centennial Medical Center.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, symptoms of NAS most often appear in infants within the first three days after birth. While symptoms may appear and vary by infant, Dr. Hamdan outlines a few common signs and symptoms of NAS, including high-pitched cries, restlessness (with sleep duration less than 1-3 hours after feeding), hyperactive reflexes, jitteriness, tremors, myoclonic jerks (involuntary muscle jerk) and convulsions.\n\nThe solution to managing and treating NAS is not always medication. Physical touch can help aid in managing the infant’s withdrawal symptoms. “The first line of treatments is to try to calm them and sooth them rather than jumping on medications,” Dr. Hamdan told Nashville’s NewsChannel5.\n\nNICU Rockers: healing through physical touch\n\nAmber Price, chief operating officer at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospital at TriStar Centennial\n\nAs a result, HCA Healthcare’s TriStar Centennial Medical Center developed NICU Rockers, a volunteer program focused on soothing and comforting infants experiencing NAS by holding and rocking them.\n\n“Our NICU wants to make sure that every baby has a loving pair of arms available around the clock, even when parents can’t physically be present,” says Amber Price, chief operating officer at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospital at TriStar Centennial. “All of our NICU Rockers are specifically trained to soothe these babies, and are available for other babies who need holding for any reason.”\n\nRocking infants with NAS helps to maintain a consistent environment for the infant throughout the withdrawal process.\n\n“Swaddling, pacifiers, low lighting, oscillating cribs and avoidance of abrupt changes in the infant’s environment can be helpful. NICU Rockers play an important role in the non-pharmacologic management of NAS,” says Dr. Hamdan. “Recent studies suggest that the Eat/Sleep/Console (ESC) approach has decreased exposure to pharmacologic agents and decrease length of stay for babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome.”\n\nNICU rocker volunteers also find the program rewarding.\n\n“Comforting a baby in withdrawal of opioids is at times a challenge, however, it is such a blessing and a rewarding experience,” said NICU Rocker volunteer, Carol Bingham. “I’m proud to provide singing, soothing, rocking and touch to a baby in need.”\n\nInterested in volunteering as a NICU Rocker?

Every baby deserves a healthy family to go home to, and by supporting our mothers we are helping them come home to a safe and supportive environment,” says Price. “The families go home with a virtual toolbox of things they can pull out in challenging situations. If a baby is crying inconsolably, we want to be sure that they have at least three tools at their disposal that will help them soothe their baby.”\n\n“If a baby has a medical condition that requires home care, it is important that caregivers have all the tools and knowledge at their disposal to feel comfortable and competent to address immediate concerns. Filling their toolbox with individualized tools ensures that they have our voices and learning immediately available any time they need to draw on resources,” Price adds.\n\nHCA Healthcare’s commitment to “Crush the Crisis”\n\nAlong with the NICU Rockers program, HCA Healthcare is helping to mitigate the opioid epidemic through our organization’s first national “Crush the Crisis” opioid take back campaign. In September 2019, dozens of HCA Healthcare facilities partnered with local and state law enforcement in 15 states to host medication take back days, collected thousands of pounds of unused and unwanted medication.\n\nA number of HCA Healthcare facilities will continue the “Crush the Crisis” campaign through the end of October, 2019.

The inquiry highlights concerns that these AI systems, which lack medical credentials, are misleading users—particularly children—into believing they offer legitimate therapeutic support. Paxton emphasized that such interactions could expose vulnerable individuals to generic, algorithmically generated responses masquerading as professional care [1].\n\nThe probe follows reports of inappropriate AI interactions, including instances where Meta’s chatbots engaged in flirting with minors. While Meta asserts that its AI chatbots are not intended for children and includes disclaimers clarifying their non-human nature, critics argue these safeguards are insufficient. Young users, lacking the critical thinking skills to interpret disclaimers, may be especially vulnerable to mistaking AI interactions for genuine emotional support [2].\n\nCharacter.AI faces similar scrutiny for hosting user-created AI personas that mimic professional therapeutic roles, including a popular \"Psychologist\" bot. The platform’s age policy explicitly excludes users under 13, yet its CEO has acknowledged that minors, including his own daughter, use the service. This contradiction raises questions about the effectiveness of age verification measures and the extent to which companies enforce their own policies [3].\n\nBoth investigations underscore broader challenges in regulating AI chatbots. As these systems become more integrated into daily life, the lack of oversight in areas like mental health care and data privacy remains a pressing issue. The Texas AG’s action aligns with a growing push for legislation such as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which seeks to impose a \"duty of care\" on online platforms to protect minors from harmful content and exploitative practices [4].\n\nThe legal probe also touches on data privacy concerns, with both Meta and Character.AI collecting extensive user data—including interactions, demographics, and browsing behavior—for AI training and targeted advertising. This practice raises ethical questions, particularly when it involves the sensitive information of young users who may not fully understand the implications of their online activity [5].\n\nThe outcome of the Texas AG’s investigation could set important precedents for how AI is regulated and developed. It may compel tech companies to adopt more transparent data practices, enhance content moderation, and implement stronger age verification systems. As AI continues to evolve, the balance between innovation and ethical responsibility becomes ever more critical. The case also highlights the urgent need for comprehensive legal frameworks that reflect the realities of AI’s expanding role in sensitive domains [6].\n\nSource: [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n[1] Title: AI Chatbot Regulation: Texas AG Launches Alarming Probe into Meta, Character.AI (https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/68a36d99bdc32e67c8ca9175/)", "source_domain": "www.ainvest.com"}

Among other things, the waiver required physicians to take an eight-hour training program before being able to prescribe buprenorphine. Other health care professionals had to take 24 hours of training.\n\n“On top of that, it gave the DEA authority to visit physician practices unannounced to specifically audit buprenorphine prescribing,” said Carlos Tirado, MD, an Austin addiction psychiatrist and member of TMA’s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health. “It created an adversarial environment in which physicians experiencing these DEA on-site practice audits often felt that they were being treated like criminals for treating a chronic medical condition.”\n\nA 2021 rule change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services allowed physicians to opt out of the eight-hour training – though they still had to obtain the waiver and face audits. Also, those who opted out could treat only 30 patients with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act eliminates X waivers entirely, including special audits or restrictions on the number of patients, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\n“All practitioners who have a current DEA registration that includes Schedule III authority, may now prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder in their practice if permitted by applicable state law and SAMHSA encourages them to do so,” the agency said.\n\nComplex cases of opioid addiction – like those with underlying problems with mental health or infectious disease – will still require input from addiction specialists, Dr. Tirado says. But eliminating the X waiver will make it easier for primary care physicians to initiate care or maintain care for patients who are stable on the medication.\n\nBuprenorphine is a partial opioid receptor agonist that partly activates opioid receptors in the brain (compared with full agonists like methadone and heroin, which activate receptors completely). The medication is designed to stop cravings for opioids.\n\nBuprenorphine also is frequently used in anesthesia and to treat pain, and its qualities as a pain treatment have often been overlooked, says Houston pain specialist Larry Driver, MD.\n\n“Hopefully now, people will recognize that it can be used effectively in treating pain,” he said. “But the other thing is, it’s not uncommon that we have a chronic pain patient who has the chronic disease of addiction. So, something like buprenorphine is a medication that can address two issues with one drug.”\n\nBuprenorphine was singled out among opioids for the X waiver because of political and law enforcement concerns over providing access to opioid replacement therapy to patients with opioid addiction, Dr. Tirado says.\n\n“There were unfounded beliefs that providing more access to buprenorphine would lead to pill mills or other forms of inappropriate prescribing,” he said.\n\nIn fact, buprenorphine is a powerful tool for physicians to combat opioid use disorder.\n\n“Restricting buprenorphine during the worst opioid crisis of our lifetimes probably contributed to making the opioid epidemic worse,” he said.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org"}

Joaquin Castro said in statements Friday that Rosa Maria Hernandez was allowed to return to her family.\n\nRosa Maria was brought to the U.S. by her parents when she was a toddler in 2007. The ACLU sued the government on Rosa Maria’s behalf on Oct. 31, days after she and an adult cousin were followed by Border Patrol to a children’s hospital. She was taken from the hospital after surgery to a San Antonio facility, where she was in the custody of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTo get to the hospital, the cousin took her through the Texas border city of Laredo to Corpus Christi, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) away, because the cousin is an American citizen and could accompany her through an interior checkpoint in South Texas without being detained.\n\nBorder Patrol agents said they had no choice but to detain Rosa Maria, arguing that she was considered an unaccompanied minor under federal law, the same as a child who crosses into the United States alone without legal permission.\n\nThe ACLU argued that the U.S. government violated federal law on unaccompanied minors and were endangering Rosa Maria’s health by not sending her home.\n\nLeticia Gonzalez, an attorney for Rosa Maria’s family, said the 10-year-old had the mental capacity of a child closer to 4 or 5 years old due to her cerebral palsy. Priscila Martinez, an activist at the Workers Defense Action Fund, said the child was showing signs of socially withdrawing while in detention and refusing to eat her favorite kind of bread.\n\nFederal immigration authorities have faced strong criticism from advocates and some Texas Democratic congressmen over their handling of the case. But U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement after she was detained that “there is no discretion with regard to the law whether or not the agents should enforce the law.”\n\nGabriel Acosta, assistant chief patrol agent for the Border Patrol’s Laredo sector, said that his agents had “acted professionally and compassionately to get this child the medical attention she needed.”", "source_domain": "www.houstonpublicmedia.org"}

From hurricanes to global pandemics to mass casualty events, we help our colleagues obtain the resources they need to provide patient-centered care in the midst of any emergency. With an estimated 24.9 million human trafficking victims worldwide, human trafficking is an emergency that we have a duty to respond to with a more personalized approach to caring for our communities.” Mike Wargo, HCA Healthcare’s vice president of enterprise emergency operations\n\n“At the local level, we collaborate with law enforcement and community-based providers to identify, interact and intervene in situations where human trafficking is suspected,” Wargo adds. “By focusing on awareness and intervention, our colleagues can help human trafficking victims transition into a pathway of survivorship.”\n\nHCA Healthcare’s Enterprise Emergency Operations Center (EEOC) is made up of nearly 200 leaders who work with experts across the country to plan and execute crisis responses.\n\nHCA Healthcare has teamed up with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) to provide online and in-person trainings to HCA Healthcare colleagues to inform and enhance the public health response to human trafficking. OTIP provides human trafficking training to professionals in healthcare, behavioral health, public health and social services settings through SOAR Online, which is administered by the National Human Trafficking Training and Technical Assistance Center (NHTTAC). The SOAR program teaches professionals how to:\n\nS TOP: describe the types of trafficking and common risk factors\n\nTOP: describe the types of trafficking and common risk factors O BSERVE: identify individual and indicators of human trafficking\n\nBSERVE: identify individual and indicators of human trafficking A SK: screen and identify individuals who may have experienced trafficking using a trauma-informed and person-centered approach\n\nSK: screen and identify individuals who may have experienced trafficking using a trauma-informed and person-centered approach RESPOND: address individual needs by coordinating across multidisciplinary stakeholders to deliver appropriate services\n\nWhat is human trafficking?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Office on Trafficking in Persons describes human trafficking as “a crime and public health concern that affects individuals, families, and communities across generations.” Also referred to as “modern slavery”, cases of human trafficking have been reported in all 50 states and individuals can be targeted for trafficking across any class, religious, cultural or ethnic group.\n\nThere are two types of trafficking in persons:\n\nLabor trafficking : individuals are compelled to work or provide services through the use of force, fraud or coercion.\n\n: individuals are compelled to work or provide services through the use of force, fraud or coercion. Sex trafficking: individuals are compelled to engage in commercial sex through the use of force, fraud or coercion. When a person under 18 years old is induced to perform a commercial sex act, it is a crime regardless of whether there is any force, fraud or coercion.\n\nWhat are the signs that someone may be experiencing trafficking?\n\nTrafficking can happen anywhere, from illicit markets to legal industries like agriculture, hospitality, construction or domestic services. While not all victims will show physical signs, the Office On Trafficking in Persons shares potential indicators:\n\nPhysical Health\n\nFrequent treatment for sexually transmitted infections\n\nHigh number of sexual partners\n\nMultiple pregnancies/abortions\n\nExposure to toxic chemicals\n\nDental issues\n\nBruising and burns\n\nSigns of self-harm\n\nWeight loss or malnourishment\n\nRespiratory issues\n\nSuicide attempts\n\nPhysical and sexual abuse\n\nBehavioral Health\n\nConfusing/contradicting stories\n\nInability to focus or concentrate\n\nUnaware of current date, location, or time\n\nProtects person who hurt them\n\nMinimizes abuse\n\nGuilt and shame about experiences\n\nSuicidal ideations\n\nExtreme timidity\n\nAggressive, antagonistic, or defensive\n\nHeightened stress response\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\n\nWithdrawn\n\nDepressed\n\nSocial/Environmental\n\nAbsent from school\n\nFailing grades\n\nSudden increase in substance use\n\nChange in dress\n\nAge-inappropriate romantic partner\n\nChange in friends\n\nRepeat runaway\n\nNot able to speak for oneself or share information\n\nEvidence of being controlled\n\nWears inappropriate clothing for the weather\n\nLives at worksite\n\nMultiple people in cramped living space\n\nHow can healthcare professionals step up in the fight against human trafficking?\n\nIt is estimated that 67.6% of individuals who have experienced trafficking encountered a healthcare professional during their trafficking experience.\n\nHealthcare providers play an important role in identifying and treating victims of trafficking. Often, victims of human trafficking suffer injuries or illnesses requiring visits with a clinician. These health issues include sexually transmitted diseases, physical injuries, burns, anxiety, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, depression, sexual violence, malnutrition, skin conditions and dental injuries. Survivors of human trafficking frequently require trauma-related mental health services.\n\nNHTTAC’s SOAR framework is a trauma-informed, culturally and linguistically appropriate response to human trafficking. It provides a quick mental reference for our healthcare professionals to keep in mind the best way to help individuals who are at risk, currently experiencing or have experienced trafficking.\n\n“By equipping our caregivers and hospitals with accessible NHTTAC tools and training, we are providing a potential lifeline to human trafficking victims and survivors that access HCA Healthcare’s facilities,” said Wargo.\n\nAll courses in the SOAR Online curriculum are available to HCA Healthcare’s more than 283,000 colleagues in HealthStream.\n\nWorking with community partners to fight human trafficking\n\nNo organization or sector can effectively fight human trafficking alone. It requires a community response. HCA Healthcare, the HCA Healthcare Foundation, and our colleagues are proud to partner with law enforcement, government, healthcare, business and community organizations to help ensure that every human has a chance to live free.\n\nA few examples of how HCA Healthcare affiliate hospitals are nurturing meaningful relationships with local community partners include:\n\nForensic nurse examiners at affiliate Mission Health in North Carolina are specially trained to provide comprehensive care for victims of human trafficking, sexual assault and abuse, domestic violence/intimate partner violence and physical assault. The nurse examiners lead a co-located clinic at the Buncombe County Family Justice Center. Mission Health sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) lead Jackie Maillet was recognized by the American Red Cross with a 2022 Western North Carolina Heroes Award for her role at the clinic and for bringing trauma-informed approaches to the emergency department.\n\nMission Health also partners with Our VOICE, a non-profit crisis intervention and prevention agency that serves as Buncombe County’s anti-sexual violence and anti-human trafficking agency.\n\nFrom HCA Healthcare’s headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, the HCA Healthcare Foundation supports the fight against human trafficking through grantmaking, sponsorships and volunteering. We have an active relationship with Thistle Farms, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing healing and hope to women survivors of trafficking, prostitution, and addiction. Another community organization that we partner with is End Slavery Tennessee, who advocates for human trafficking victims, educates communities across the state and the region, and informs legislators about the critical need to enact tougher laws so that traffickers are duly prosecuted.\n\nIn Wichita, Kansas affiliate Wesley Healthcare is working with Hope Ranch for Women, a nonprofit organization offering faith-based equine-assisted learning, mentoring and a residential home to empower and heal women who have been exploited and abused. A Wesley Healthcare nurse colleague has stepped up in the fight and regularly volunteers her time with the organization.\n\nIn Florida, HCA Florida Aventura Hospital has developed a local human trafficking program and HCA Florida JFK Hospital has helped to identify trafficking victims within an addiction stabilization unit.\n\nHelp and resources\n\nThe National Human Trafficking Hotline is a 24/7, confidential, multilingual hotline for victims, survivors and individuals with human trafficking concerns.\n\nCall: 1-888-373-7888\n\nText: “BeFree” (233733)\n\nLive chat: humantraffickinghotline.org", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

Video game addiction, or “gaming,” has been added to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) list of mental health conditions. The disorder was added last week to WHO’s disease classification manual, which identifies health trends.\n\nAudrey Nottke, director of nursing over behavioral health services at The Medical Center of Aurora, told the local Fox affiliate in Denver that she believes this is a step in the right direction.\n\n“Right now we are seeing people spend up to 16 hours a day just playing on these video games, so this allows them to reach out for help,” Nottke said.\n\nSome experts believe labeling “gaming” as a diagnosis is a bit premature.\n\n“The behavioral health community is governed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5),” Nottke explained. “Currently, the DSM refers to internet gaming disorder as a ‘condition for further study’. However, I can safely say that behavioral health experts recognize all addictions and are supportive of any individual who reaches out to get help for a gaming disorder.”\n\nIf parents are struggling to control the amount of time their child spends in front of a screen, here’s what they should know about the newest mental health condition.\n\nWhat is gaming disorder?\n\nGaming Disorder involves playing digital or video games to an excessive extent. According to WHO, there are three characteristics that define this disorder, including,\n\nimpaired control over gaming,\n\nincreasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that the gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and\n\ncontinuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences\n\nWhat criteria does one have to meet to be considered as having the disorder?\n\nContext is important when considering the criteria. However, if someone can answer yes to five of the following items within one year that might indicate an addiction:\n\nPreoccupation or obsession with Internet games.\n\nFeeling restless when not playing Internet games.\n\nCraving more time playing the games.\n\nThe person has tried to stop or curb playing Internet games, but has failed to do so.\n\nThe person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies.\n\nA person has had continued overuse of Internet games even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person’s life.\n\nThe person lied to others about his or her Internet game usage.\n\nThe person uses Internet games to relieve anxiety or guilt–it’s a way to escape.\n\nThe person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of Internet games.\n\nGaming has started to interfere with job/school performance.\n\nFeeling guilty or depressed about gaming.\n\nWhy do people choose gaming?\n\nIt offers:\n\na temporary escape,\n\nconstant measurable growth,\n\nimmediate feedback,\n\na challenge, and\n\nsocial status, which is dependent on how well the individual plays the game. One’s status can improve quickly in gaming, which may not be the case outside of the game.\n\nHow to recognize gaming condition?\n\nIf a loved one starts:\n\nlosing interest in being socially active outside of the internet game,\n\nno longer attends to various responsibilities (i.e. school, work, relationships), or\n\nthe person lies to others about his or her Internet game usage.\n\nWhat can individuals do to replace gaming?\n\nMy recommendation is to encourage that person to learn a different hobby that involves other individuals. Activities like board games, sports or playing in a band are ideal. Also, there are a ton of great suggestions on the Game Quitters website here.\n\nWhat are some resources people can go to for help?\n\nAnyone who might need assistance for a gaming addiction can contact their local healthcare provider for evaluation and treatment. Individuals can also contact the substance abuse and mental health services administration’s national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Help is also available at treatment centers that specialize in video game addictions, such as Cottonwood Tucson or reSTART.\n\nAudrey Nottke serves as the director of nursing over behavioral health services at HealthONE’s The Medical Center of Aurora, an affiliate of HCA Healthcare.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

One in particular is Cal tight end transfer, Jack Endries. The Texas coach called him “cerebral and a team-first player”.\n\n\n\nOne of the newest players in the burnt orange, Endries is fresh off a fantastic 2024 campaign where he caught 56 passes for 623 yards and two touchdowns.

He hauled in 60 receptions for 786 yards and seven touchdowns. Helm set school single-season records last year for receptions (60) and yards (786) by a Texas tight end.\n\n\n\nWell, now he’s gone and Sarkisian wet out west to California to find Arch Manning a safety blanket. The Longhorns head coach also noted he wants Endries “to do things the right way, especially when the offense is new to him”.\n\n\n\nEndries is a fantastic blend of a pass-catching tight end who can extend drives. He can also stick his nose in there and block for you on running and passing downs. The latter being crucial as Texas breaks in four new starters on the offensive line and a new quarterback under center.\n\nI expect for Manning and Endries to continue to build chemistry as we count down to the season opener at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio August 30.\n\n\n\n", "source_domain": "atozsports.com"}

Among the first of the county’s expenditures is a $2 million expansion of Parkland Health’s program to connect people coming out of jail with medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for their addiction.\n\nParkland would use about $1.5 million for personnel staff and another half million for program costs, according to a briefing on the MAT program .\n\nThe goal is to screen an additional 200 people released from the Dallas County Jail for medication assisted treatment. Fifty people will get connected to “internal resources or community partners.”\n\nAssistant County Administrator Charles Reed told commissioners the program came out of a previous desire from elected officials to expand medication-assisted treatment for people leaving jail.\n\n“This program specifically was for the inmates in our jail that are experiencing opioid use disorder and making sure that when they get out, they have the proper warm handoff into the Parkland MAT services in the community — that are already there,” Reed said.\n\nCommissioners authorized the agreement at a meeting on Tuesday, although one, John Wiley Price, wanted to know if community partners had the bandwidth to handle a ramped-up jail release program.\n\n“You’re talking about $1.5 million for staff [to help] 200 people. What do you hand them off to?” Price asked county staff. “What is the bandwidth in the community? Where is it now?”\n\n“We’ll figure out what their capacity is,” said County Administrator Darryl Martin.\n\nTexas is estimated to receive about $1.6 billion in opioid settlement money . A portion of that is being distributed among counties.\n\nReed said cities and behavioral health providers are planning to apply for additional state money specifically to increase beds for addiction treatment.\n\n“One of the primary limitations we have right is the availability of residential beds for opioid use disorder treatment,” Reed said.\n\nReed said an opioid task force composed of county staff is drafting a plan for using the county’s opioid settlement money. They hope to finish by October 1.\n\nAmong the task force’s ideas are training detention service officers to recognize the symptoms of opioid use disorder at jail intake. Another is to expand drug courts to specifically address opioid addiction. County staff are also drafting a grant program for community groups.\n\nDo you have a tip?

Blau, Ph.D., will be its new Executive Director. For the past 15 years, Dr. Blau has served as Chief of the Child, Adolescent and Family Branch for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in Maryland. He will assume his new role in Houston beginning Sept. 13.\n\n\n\n“After 25 years in government on the federal and state level, it’s been a dream for me to be able to take on a role such as this with a focus on putting policy into practice,” Dr. Blau said. “I’m thrilled with this opportunity to take my knowledge and skills and apply them to efforts in Houston, the greater Gulf Coast, and across Texas.”\n\n\n\nAt SAMHSA, Dr. Blau provided national leadership for children’s mental health, helping create systems of care across the country – including many projects in Texas – and launching an array of high-impact policy and practice transformation efforts that have changed the landscape of mental health for children. Prior to his work on the national level, Dr. Blau served as Connecticut’s Director of Mental Health and as Bureau Chief for Quality Management at the state’s Department of Children and Families (DCF). In addition, as Director of Clinical Services at the Child and Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut, Dr. Blau supervised outpatient, home-based, and school-based services.\n\n\n\nDr. Blau has extensive experience in public policy, developing evidence-based community programs, implementing health care reform initiatives, and focusing on critical issues such as trauma, school-based mental health, prevention and early intervention, health disparities, and poverty. He is perhaps best known for his leadership in expanding awareness and support for the values and principles reflected in the “system of care” framework; namely, that services and supports should be organized into a coordinated network, that meaningful partnerships should be built with service users, and that services and systems should be evidence-based and culturally and linguistically competent. He has a wide range of experiences from direct clinical work, to supervising state-operated inpatient and residential facilities for children, to creating the “National Building Bridges Initiative (BBI),” which is focused on improving outcomes for youth who receive residential interventions.\n\n\n\nDr. Blau’s reputation as a collaborator who is skilled at bringing together service providers, researchers, and policy and decision-makers, as well as family members, youth, and community partners, connects directly with The Hackett Center for Mental Health’s mission.\n\n\n\n“The Hackett Center is proud to have someone of Dr. Blau’s exceptional talent, experience, and reputation as our Executive Director,” said THC Founder Maureen Hackett. “His nationally-recognized leadership and expertise will help advance our mission to change mental health care and put policy into practice in Houston, along the Texas Gulf Coast, and beyond.”\n\n\n\n“Dr. Blau is an extraordinary, accomplished thought leader within the national mental health community, and has a wealth of experience that will prove invaluable as The Hackett Center continues its important work of helping improve mental health care along the Gulf Coast, particularly among children,” said MMHPI President and CEO Andy Keller, Ph.D. “We are grateful to have someone of his caliber and reputation taking the reins at THC.”\n\n\n\nDr. Blau succeeds Susan Fordice, who served as Executive Director through THC’s first year of operation. Fordice now serves as a Senior Fellow for the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.\n\n\n\nA champion of youth and families, Dr. Blau helped craft the concept of “family-driven care,” ensuring families have a role in their treatment and in the improvement of services and systems. He is acknowledged as the “father” of Youth MOVE (Youth Motivating Others through Voices of Experience), a national, youth-led mental health organization that now has more than 65 chapters across the United States. Youth MOVE has named one of its annual awards the “Dr. Gary Blau Award,” which is given yearly to a mental health professional who has distinguished themself as a voice for youth.\n\n\n\nDr. Blau received his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at Auburn University and continues to write and publish nationally in the area of children’s mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Hackett Center for Mental Health\n\nThrough the generosity of the Maureen and Jim Hackett Family, The Hackett Center for Mental Health was established in January 2018 as the inaugural regional center of the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. Leveraging the participation of exceptionally skilled researchers, community leaders, and health care providers, The Hackett Center’s purpose is to transform systems and influence policy through unprecedented collaboration.\n\nAbout MMHPI\n\nSince its public launch in 2014, MMHPI has helped Texas legislators, government officials, members of the judiciary, and local leaders identify systemic mental health needs and solutions, quickly becoming Texas’s most trusted source for data-driven mental health policy. MMHPI is helping Texas leaders address the mental health crisis in our jails and emergency rooms, improve access to care for veterans and their families, shift the focus of new investments toward early intervention, and expand the mental health workforce.\n\nAttachments", "source_domain": "www.globenewswire.com"}

Now it's all clean. Florence says she stopped using heroin five months ago; she stopped using methamphetamine not long after that.\n\n\"Shooting it, smoking it, snorting it,\" Florence says. \"It's horrible, just made me feel like crap, you know. But I'd still did it. Just makes no sense, you know. It's just really addicting.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Daley/Colorado Public Radio John Daley/Colorado Public Radio\n\nMeth is particularly insidious, she says, because it's cheap, readily available and \"very common. Everybody does it.\"\n\nHer assessment is in line with drug-overdose numbers from Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment, which show meth's enduring presence in the state. The drug was found in the systems of 280 Coloradans who died of overdoses in 2017 — up sharply from the year before. That number was more than five times that recorded in 2012.\n\nDenver Recovery Group's executive director, Denise Vincioni, says her organization still sees \"rampant use of methamphetamine.\" It's very difficult to treat on an outpatient basis, she says.\n\nAdmissions for the use of methamphetamine to what was once the state's largest drug treatment facility — the now-closed Arapahoe House — almost doubled from 2013 to 2017. Statewide figures for meth-related treatment admissions have also risen steadily over the last five years. And there's a new twist, Vincioni says: In the past, users mainly seemed to stick to one drug — opioid pills or heroin or cocaine. Now, they're using those along with meth.\n\n\"They're almost going hand in hand,\" says Vincioni.\n\nMcConnell says once people come in for treatment, \"They start to get off the opiates, but their meth use increases.\"\n\nLoading Graphic...\n\nContrary to the portrayal of meth production in popular TV dramas, the meth in Colorado these days is rarely cooked up in neighborhood basements from local drugstore ingredients. Instead, it's mostly imported, often along the same routes as heroin.\n\n\"I would say almost 100 percent of our meth comes from Mexico,\" says Tom Gorman, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. Much of it is mass produced there, he says, in \"superlabs.\"\n\nThe drug's continued impact shows up in police statistics. Denver arrests for possession of meth nearly tripled in 2017 compared to 2013. The amount of methamphetamine seized by HIDTA-funded drug task forces across Colorado, as well as by Colorado state patrol officers, went up sharply from 2016 to 2017.\n\nMeth has been overshadowed by opioids and marijuana in news headlines in Colorado recently, Gorman says, but \"we've had a meth problem in this area for a long time.\"\n\nAre more people using the drug now?\n\n\"Maybe,\" he says. \"But it's always been our number one problem.\"\n\nSara Florence at the Denver Recovery Group is a 36-year-old mother of three. Her reliance on drugs started early, she says — at age 15, when her parents gave her pain pills for a toothache. Just like that, she was hooked.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I grew up around it, you know,\" Florence says. \"It was around me, my environment. Both my parents were addicts, and so, you know, it was kind of rough not to be one.\"\n\nThose troubles eventually led to heroin and an eight year struggle with meth. The day she got arrested for stealing a Subaru was when she hit bottom, Florence says.\n\n\"I was homeless and had nowhere to live, and driving the stolen vehicle and sleeping in it.\" The ultimate charge, Florence says, was \"aggravated motor vehicle theft.\"\n\nThen it was off to drug court and eventually to the Denver Recovery Group. After seeing her drug test come back clean, counselor McConnell gave Florence a big hug.\n\n\"It's just so much better quality life now that I'm not doing anything,\" Florence says. \"This is the cleanest I've been since I was 15 years old.\"\n\nStill, Vincioni worries about the impact of this latest meth surge — how it could affect her clients. People with a dependency on more than one drug are that much harder to treat, and that limits their chances of \"continued sustained recovery,\" she says.\n\nHer facility treats clients on an outpatient basis, but Vincioni knows that many would need more intensive inpatient services to deal with a meth addiction.\n\n\"It's very difficult to stabilize patients who continue to use meth,\" Vincioni says.\n\nIf a client drops out of the treatment and counseling program at Denver Recovery Group, the staff often doesn't know what happens to them. The worry is they might not survive.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with Colorado Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.", "source_domain": "www.npr.org"}

A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOfficials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.\n\nMuch of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.\n\nThat includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.\n\nFederal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.\n\nThe workforce at SAMHSA dropped to a low of 376 employees in 2020, according to records tallied by the Partnership for Public Service, down from a high of 553 in 2014.\n\nOver the same time, survey scores of employee satisfaction at SAMHSA dropped to a record low of 27 out of 100, far below the average for federal agencies.\n\nEmployee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.\n\nMost federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.\n\nAgencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.\n\nSome agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.\n\nIt is not clear how many total workers were ultimately cut from HHS.\n\nAt SAMHSA, officials remaining at the agency said the firings were frustrating, undoing hard-won hires in some cases for needed positions.\n\nOne health official warned of a repeat from the \"doom loop\" that plagued the agency during the first Trump administration, where most of the highest performing workers fled SAMHSA for jobs in the private sector, feeding a drop in morale.\n\nSome staff remained because they were committed to public service, the official said. But many others remained because they were stuck in their jobs at SAMHSA, either because of personal circumstances or because they were unable to get hired elsewhere.\n\n\"Last time it took them two or three years to induce the doom loop.

Link to Full Meeting\n\nPlus: Ask questions about this article.\n\nIn a recent McKinney ISD school board meeting, discussions centered around the implementation of a new law regulating cell phone use in schools, reflecting a growing concern for student mental health and classroom focus. The board acknowledged the challenges posed by technology in educational settings, particularly the distractions caused by cell phones.\n\n\n\nSuperintendent Dr. Winters reported a mixed response from the community regarding the new regulations, noting that initial feedback was roughly split between support and concern. However, he mentioned that since the law's implementation, there has been little ongoing feedback from parents, suggesting a possible acceptance of the changes.\n\n\n\nThe board members discussed the potential benefits of limiting cell phone access during school hours, citing research that indicates reduced screen time can positively impact students' emotional and psychological well-being. They highlighted that many educators have observed improved focus in classrooms since the policy took effect, with teachers reporting a noticeable shift in student engagement.\n\n\n\nWhile some board members expressed concerns about the balance between parental rights and school regulations, they ultimately agreed on the necessity of the law for enhancing student safety and concentration. The decision to keep cell phones out of sight but accessible in emergencies was seen as a compromise to address safety concerns while minimizing distractions.\n\n\n\nThe board unanimously approved the motion to adhere to the new law, marking a significant step in McKinney ISD's efforts to foster a more conducive learning environment. As the school year progresses, the district will continue to monitor the impact of these regulations on student behavior and academic performance, aiming to support both educational goals and student well-being.\n\n\n\nConverted from McKinney ISD, TX - School Board Meeting meeting on August 18, 2025\n\nLink to Full Meeting", "source_domain": "citizenportal.ai"}

Acosta\n\nUTEP Communications\n\nA road trip through West Texas' border counties last summer exposed Thenral Mangadu, M.D., Ph.D., to the challenges that rural communities face to combat opioid use disorder (OUD).\n\nRCORP consortium members include, from left, Thenral Mangadu, UTEP MARC director; Isaac Duran, CASFV battering intervention and prevention program; Rosa Escalante, Aliviane and MARC program coordinator; Ivonne Tapia, Aliviane CEO; Nate Robinson, UTEP MARC deputy director; Guillermo Valenzuela, Aliviane COO; and Adriana Corona Luevanos, OBPH program manager. Photo: Ivan Pierre Aguirre/UTEP Communications\n\nAs opioid-related deaths rise across the United States, rural areas have been hit especially hard. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas surpassed the rate in urban areas in 2015. Drug overdose deaths also increased 325 percent in rural counties between 1999 and 2015.\n\n“I went to these communities because I needed to see what is going on,” Mangadu, associate professor of public health sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso, said about her two-day fact-finding trip to Hudspeth, Culberson, Presidio, Brewster and Jeff Davis counties with a collaborator from the Texas Department of State Health Services’ Office of Border Public Health (OBPH).\n\nIn Presidio, Mangadu also met with local stakeholders from the border town of Ojinaga, Chihuahua, Mexico, and learned about the health professional shortages and health disparities in the border rural counties.\n\n“The consensus in these areas is that we need more treatment and prevention services, a bigger health care workforce, more research and more coordinated care,” she said.\n\nMangadu’s fact-finding mission was the basis for a new project funded by a $200,000 grant awarded to Aliviane Inc. from the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Rural Communities Opioid Response Program (RCORP). UTEP’s new Minority AIDS Research Center (MARC) is one of the grant’s subrecipients.\n\nThe RCORP is a multi-year opioid-focused initiative supported by HRSA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, aimed at reducing the morbidity and mortality of substance use disorder, including opioid use disorder, in high-risk rural communities.\n\nIn May 2019, HRSA awarded $24 million in RCORP grants to rural organizations across 40 states to combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.\n\nThe Aliviane grant established a multi-sector consortium focused on developing strategies for preventing and treating substance use and opioid use disorder in high-risk rural communities along the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nThe consortium, which involves Aliviane, MARC, OBPH and the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence (CASFV), will develop a plan for opioid use disorder response in Hudspeth, Culberson, Presidio, Brewster and Jeff Davis counties.\n\n“The proximity of these counties to the Mexico border is a high risk for opioid use,” said Guillermo Valenzuela, Aliviane’s chief corporate officer. “Mexico remains the primary source of heroin available in the United States, according to all available sources of intelligence, including law enforcement investigations and scientific data.”\n\nThe consortium is one of six projects underway by UTEP’s MARC. Founded in 2019 by Mangadu and Nate Robinson, UTEP assistant vice president for facility security in the Office of Research and Sponsored Projects, the center aims to advance research and treatment for minority populations relative to HIV/AIDS, with complementary work in substance abuse.\n\nProjects address AIDS-related health disparities such as substance abuse, mental health, and exposure to violence in vulnerable populations locally and worldwide.\n\nIn addition to working with community partners such as Aliviane, a nonprofit drug treatment center in El Paso, MARC also has established international partnerships in Eastern and Southern Africa through its Global Alliance for Healthier Populations (GAHP).\n\n“The consortium is among UTEP’s many efforts toward improving our border community and the levels of community engagement,” said Robinson, MARC’s deputy director. “The goal for MARC is to support our partners, like Aliviane, the grant’s lead recipient, in building greater capacity and reach and its formal bringing together of a public private partnership to address disparities.”\n\nOver the course of one year, the consortium will lead the efforts to conduct a regional needs assessment and workforce development plan in Texas Health Service Region 10, which includes the five West Texas rural counties.\n\nAccording to Aliviane, these counties are vulnerable to substance use and opioid use disorder because of low socioeconomic status, lack of access to care, transportation barriers, immigration policy-related barriers, proximity to violence, access to drugs, health professional shortages, and low health literacy.\n\n“These counties have more availability to high-purity, low-cost heroin, and Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, which are now the most lethal category of opioids used in the U.S.,” Valenzuela said. “Synthetic opioids are primarily sourced from China and Mexico.”\n\nThe consortium’s researchers will conduct a SWOT analysis – strength, weakness, opportunity, threat – to identify opportunities and gaps in OUD prevention, treatment, and/or recovery services within the five counties. Data will be used to develop workforce, service delivery, and sustainability plans that focus on prevention, treatment and recovery.\n\n“We’re going to be looking at many things like social determinants of health, the gaps in treatment services, health professional preparation and workforce development,” Mangadu said. “Each of the community partners in this consortium has a vested interest because this is what we’ve been doing for many years – substance use disorder and HIV-related action research. This HRSA grant is an opportunity for us to come together to make an impact in opioid use disorder in Texas’ rural areas.”", "source_domain": "www.utep.edu"}

It happened on Sunday in Colorado Springs.\n\nDEA\n\n\"There was drug trafficking. There was guns. There was prostitution. There was crimes of violence,\" explained Jonathan Pullen, special agent in charge for the DEA Rocky Mountain Division.\n\nAccording to Pullen, the illegal drugs at the party were supplied by the Sinaloa cartel, and the DEA is putting their foot on the gas when it comes to getting drugs off the streets, especially when it comes to fentanyl.\n\n\"In fact, we've seized enormous amounts of fentanyl this year,\" Pullen said. \"I actually thought we would seize less. I thought with the border being tighter, we'd see smaller seizures. I was wrong. We have seized so much fentanyl this year.\"\n\nAlthough deaths related to the drug have dropped significantly in the state and across the country, the presence of fentanyl has increased.\n\n\"We think there may be some stockpiling happening on the U.S. side from the Mexican cartels, and that's why we're seeing such large amounts right now,\" Pullen said.\n\nThis particular bust also included the arrest of more than 100 people thought to be in the country illegally, but Pullen says that wasn't the intent of the operation.\n\n\"Quite frankly, we were there for the drug investigation,\" Pullen said. \"We didn't ask the illegal immigrants to come.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has given the DEA Title 8 authority, which mandates it involves Immigration and Customs Enforcement when encountering individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. It's something the previous administration didn't do but Pullen said has significantly helped.\n\nNow, suspected unauthorized individuals from nine different countries, including El Salvador, Venezuela, Honduras and Mexico will potentially face removal from the country.\n\n\"Our choices previously were to wait 'till the investigation runs its course before we arrest everybody, so we don't tip the whole network off,\" Pull said. \"In the meantime, that person's still selling fentanyl, and it's likely going to kill somebody. Now, we have the option to turn that person over to ICE if they're here illegally, and they can go back to their home country, and they're not selling fentanyl that's going to kill people in Denver anymore.\"\n\nA Fort Carson Army staff sergeant was also arrested on drug charges as part of the bust.

So why don't you brush your teeth,\" McAuliffe suggests.\n\n\"Okay,\" replies Aiden.\n\n\"Thanks,\" she says.\n\nGrowing up in Steamboat Springs, McAuliffe started ski racing when she was a kid. This eventually led to freestyle snowboarding, competing in the halfpipe and multiple injuries.\n\n\"Broken ankles, broken wrist, broken ribs, dislocations,\" she said. \"So, I was put on prescription painkillers pretty much at age 16 to 18.\"\n\nWhen McAuliffe could no longer get Percocet, OxyContin or Hydrocodone from doctors, she started using heroin. Throughout her drug use, McAuliffe had several stints in rehab, but couldn't stay sober. After her second overdose, she decided to try medication-assisted treatment (MAT). MAT combines medications and behavioral therapy to treat substance use disorders.\n\nBut two years ago, McAuliffe would not have been able to get MAT in Steamboat Springs.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Nancy Best, executive director of Road to Recovery, meets with patient Jonathan Perez. “I feel like I got my life,” says Perez about the medication-assisted treatment services he receives at the facility.\n\nA block off Lincoln Ave, Steamboat's main street, is a Victorian house built in 1912. The bright yellow building with purple trim is home to Mountain Medical Road to Recovery. It's the first integrated addiction medication and behavioral health clinic providing MAT services in Routt County. Before it opened in 2018, people struggling with opioid use disorder had to travel to Grand Junction or Denver for treatment.\n\n\"We came here to try to stop people from dying from overuse of prescribed opiates or from heroin,\" said Nancy Best, executive director of Road to Recovery.\n\nIn 2016, 19 people died of opioid overdoses in Routt County. That's why it and Pueblo County, which also had a high overdose rate, were selected for a new pilot program approved by the state legislature in 2017.\n\nThe Medication-assisted Treatment Pilot Program expanded access to MAT to opioid-dependent patients in Routt and Pueblo counties. Over the course of two years, the program provided $500,000 in grants for to community and office-based practices, behavioral health organizations and substance abuse treatment organizations. Three facilities were selected for the grant, including Road to Recovery.\n\nThe pilot program, administered by the College of Nursing at the University of Colorado Anschutz, had two goals. The first was to increase access to MAT services and medications which include methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone.\n\n\"Those are either medications that help you to not go into withdrawal and help to rebalance the chemical imbalance in your brain that may happen when you have an opioid use disorder,\" said Tanya Sorrell, an associate professor at the College of Nursing, who helped oversee the grants.\n\nThe second goal was to increase the number of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who tend to practice in rural areas, according to Sorrell.\n\nThe two-year pilot program has been a success. Between the two counties, over 700 people have been treated and 10 additional nurse practitioners and physician assistants received their waivers from the Drug Enforcement Agency to prescribe MAT.\n\nIn May, Gov. Polis signed a bill extending the pilot program for two more years. It was expanded to include the San Luis Valley and two other counties that demonstrate a need for MAT services. The funding was increased to $2.5 million.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Tanya Sorrell is an assistant professor at the College of Nursing at the University of Colorado Anschutz. The college administered the Medication-assisted Treatment Pilot Program created by the state legislature in 2017. This May, Gov. Polis signed a bill expanding the program and extending it for another two years.\n\nIn April 2018, Best prescribed McAuliffe Suboxone. Suboxone, which is a brand name for buprenorphine/naloxone, is known as a partial opioid agonist. It's a partial opioid and the effect is weaker than full agonists like heroin and methadone. But after using Suboxone for awhile, McAuliffe no longer wanted to take an opioid-based medication.\n\nShe decided to switch to Vivitrol, a long-acting injectable form of naltrexone, another MAT medication. Unlike Suboxone, Vivitrol is an antagonist and blocks the opioid receptors in the brain and the euphoric effects of drugs like heroin.\n\n\"With Vivitrol, you can't abuse it and it's not an opiate,\" said McAuliffe. \"I just wanted to be 100% clean from all drugs.\"\n\nBut changing medications wasn't easy. Since Vivitrol blocks opioids, a patient needs to be sober for eight days before taking it. The problem: McAuliffe was on Suboxone, a partial opioid. Best did not want her to abruptly stop using that medication, then wait more than a week to get on Vivitrol, and McAuliffe couldn't quickly switch from drug to the other.\n\n\"Suboxone is a partial opioid agonist, meaning it's sitting on that receptor,\" Best said. \"If I give her naltrexone or a Vivitrol shot, it's going to kick that off the receptor and she's going to be sicker than she ever has been.\"\n\nSo Best, who is a physician assistant and certified addiction counselor, got creative. She cross tapered two medications over eight days, decreasing the Suboxone while increasing the oral Naltrexone dosage. Then McAuliffe was able to get a Vivitrol shot.\n\n\"I was honest. I just told Ashley (McAuliffe) you're going to be the first one.\"\n\nBest's experiment worked and McAuliffe received her first Vivitrol shot in December 2018. Since then, she gets the injection every 28 days.\n\nVivitrol and Naltrexone are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat opioid use disorders and alcohol use disorders. But over a year ago, Best started using the medication to treat another type of drug addiction: methamphetamine.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Melinda McDowell was the first patient at Road to Recovery in Steamboat Springs to be prescribed Naltrexone and Vivitrol for methamphetamine addiction.\n\nDuring the spring of 2018, Melinda McDowell spent her days on her bathroom floor, smoking crystal meth.\n\n\"I was tweaking pretty hard. I was hallucinating so bad,\" she said.\n\nHer husband was away in Japan and her two youngest kids had been taken into foster care due to her heavy drug use, which had spanned more than two decades. One day, McDowell looked in a mirror and decided to quit.\n\n\"I knew I looked like crap and I knew that I had to stop, otherwise I was going to die,\" she said.\n\nA friend, who McDowell met in a recovery program, had given her the number for Road to Recovery. McDowell said she called Best, begging for help.\n\nBest had never prescribed a MAT medication for methamphetamine addiction before but knew research on the effects of naltrexone and Vivitrol existed. The first drug had shown more positive results than the second.\n\nSo Best initially prescribed naltrexone. She said McDowell called within an hour of taking the medication and was ecstatic.\n\n\"Sure enough it just, my body started relaxing,\" McDowell said, \"I started feeling relief and the withdrawal and the cravings were going away.\"\n\nBut naltrexone is a daily pill and Best wasn't sure if McDowell could maintain the strict schedule. So, she put McDowell on Vivitrol too. She's been taking both medications for over a year.\n\n\"It's a miracle. It's a miracle. Um, I should not be sitting here today. I should be dead, but Nancy literally saved my life,\" McDowell said.\n\nMcDowell, 45, is getting her life back together. She's filed an appeal to regain custody of her kids and is studying to become a certified addiction counselor. McDowell goes to regular group meetings and counseling sessions at Road to Recovery. She has developed a sober support network.\n\n\"We've got our awesome community of people that we're just so tight and close,\" McDowell said. \"I've referred people who've referred people, who've referred people.\"\n\nBut despite the success of Road to Recovery and the MAT program, McDowell said some people in the recovery community believe in abstinence only. Using medication, she said, comes with a stigma.\n\n\"A lot of the people at the NA (Narcotics Anonymous) groups, they looked down upon us because they say, 'Oh, well you're still taking legal drugs,'\" said McDowell. \"But this is non-addictive. It can't get you high. The only thing it does is give you, it's like a crutch. It helps you stay sober. I mean I don't understand why people just don't get it.\"\n\nMcDowell has struggled with addiction for over 30 years. She said, if necessary, she'll take naltrexone and Vivitrol for the rest of her life.\n\nSince treating McDowelll, Best has prescribed the medications to treat other patients dealing with methamphetamine and alcohol addictions.\n\nCredit Stephanie Daniel / KUNC / KUNC Ashley McAuliffe is a manager at an upscale grocery store in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. She receives a Vivitrol injection once a month to treat her opioid use disorder.\n\nAbout three miles from Road to Recovery, McAuliffe cuts a large submarine sandwich into smaller pieces to be individually wrapped and sold. She's a manager at an upscale grocery store at the base of the ski mountain.\n\n\"I feel great overall. Just working hard, exercising hard, you know,\" McAuliffe said. \"More available for my kiddo.\"\n\nLike McDowell, she's also finishing up a program to become a certified addiction counselor. McAuliffe wants to help others who struggle with substance use disorders. But she remains focused on her own sobriety.\n\n\"I always have that fear of relapse,\" McAuliffe said. \"I think I'm going to stay on Vivitrol for a year to two years and that's a good safety net for me.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct which two medications Nancy Best cross tapered Ashley McAuliffe between.", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org"}

He and his friends had been ready to get lunch when they first heard gunshots outside. They had not recognized the sound and thought the bangs were construction noises. Then a teacher ran into the library and screamed at them to hide.\n\nWhen the shooting stopped, Eubanks ran through the smoke out of the library, and out of the school. He was 17, with gunshot wounds in his hand and knee, and he had just witnessed his best friend killed in front of him.\n\nHours after the latest school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Eubanks, now 36, spoke about the vivid parallels between Wednesday’s school shooting and the Columbine shooting on 20 April 1999.\n\n“The similarity here, just in the images coming out in the media, with Columbine, is pretty surreal: the students rushing out with their hands above their heads and the armored vehicles and the police cars and the ambulances on the grass,” Eubanks said. “This one is really close to home.”\n\n“The primary emotion for me these days is anger,” he said. “That’s because I see the aftermath of what happens.”\n\nEubanks, who works at a long-term residential treatment center in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, now speaks publicly on the links between mass shootings and other violence and America’s growing opioid crisis.\n\n“We’re dealing with a problem of massive proportions with the rise in mass violence, and I think there’s a direct correlation with the rise in addiction,” he said.\n\nWhen he was 17, injured and grieving the death of his friend, Eubanks did not know how to process the trauma he experienced. Instead, he tried to hide from the pain.\n\nWithin months of Columbine, Eubanks, who was prescribed opiate medication for his shooting injuries, was addicted to painkillers, and used medication to avoid dealing with his grief. It took him more than 12 years of damaged relationships, and multiple arrests for fights, theft and impulsive behavior, to get sober.\n\nHis advice for the survivors of Wednesday’s school shooting is to lean in to the pain and grief that they are feeling, and not try to escape it.\n\n“You can heal physical pain while you’re medicating it. You cannot heal emotional pain while you are medicating it,” he said. Survivors look for something in their lives that allows them to detach from the pain – substance abuse, negative relationships, technology – but that’s the wrong choice, Eubanks said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Austin Eubanks with his girlfriend during a community wide memorial service in Littleton, Colorado, on 25 April 1999, for the victims of the shooting rampage at Columbine High School. Photograph: Laura Rauch/AP\n\n“In order to heal emotional pain, you have to feel it,” he said. “You want to feel better immediately, [but] you have to have the courage to sit in and feel it, and if you can do that long enough, you will come out on the other side.”\n\nAlong with post-traumatic stress, Eubanks said, there is also the potential for post-traumatic growth. “That doesn’t imply you will ever be the same person again. After a trauma, you will be changed forever.”\n\nAt Columbine, 12 students and one teacher were murdered, and two dozen injured, before the two perpetrators killed themselves. In Parkland, after two decades of Congressional refusal to pass stricter gun laws, the death toll is even higher, with at least 17 people dead, including a football coach. The Parkland shooting is the deadliest high school shooting in contemporary American history, according to statistics compiled by Mother Jones, which has tracked incidents going back to 1982.\n\n\n\nBut the effect of a shooting like Columbine or Parkland cannot be measured only in the number of those injured or killed, Eubanks said. The students who witnessed the shooting, the ones who lost friends, the first responders, the family members – all of these people are affected, and the impact of the trauma and grief can be passed along to their partners and their children, particularly when survivors turn to substance abuse to cope.\n\n“The trauma, it ripples through society,” he said. “What would initially start as a few hundred directly affected will become thousands, and, in 10 years, tens of thousands just from this one shooting.\n\n“These are massive, massive traumas, and it’s like an earthquake, it ripples. That’s what I want people to see.”\n\n“My fear is that we’re going to be in the same place that we are every time: that everyone is going to fracture in their opinion and nothing is going to change. If we have a government that is not even willing to fund a study into why this is occurring – there’s no better definition of putting your head int the sand than that.”\n\nEubanks said he would like to see the government invest in research to understand and address violence, rather than bowing to political pressure to cut off funding for public health research on guns at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as the US did in 1996.\n\n“There’s a common thread through all of this and nobody’s talking about it. The common thread is isolation, loneliness and adverse childhood experiences.”\n\n“Why is it always men? It’s not testosterone that’s doing this,” he said. “There’s something wrong in our society and we have to figure out what it is.”", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com"}

Information displayed for each location includes the type of site — such as community health clinics, recovery support services or vending machines — and their hours, phone numbers and websites.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, when Naloxone is administered, it attaches to opioid receptors in the brain and blocks the effects of opioids, allowing users’ breathing to be restored.\n\nJordan Baker, a TODA program manager, worked with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and an initiative led by the University of Texas Health San Antonio called Naloxone Texas to create the map. He said an analysis revealed access to Naloxone was a primary issue across the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We did interviews with local harm-reduction organizations and prevention agencies, a lot of universities and really just subject matter experts and community members and those lived experiences to identify regional challenges,” Baker said. “But across the board, we heard that access and awareness of where the Naloxone was a big issue.”\n\nIn September 2023, TODA received $3.9 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides grant funding to 90 health departments across the country to reduce drug overdoses and the impact of related harms, using data surveillance on drug poisonings. The grant program runs through 2028, with required reapplication each year for continued funding.\n\nTODA recently submitted its application for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, a DSHS spokesperson told StateScoop.\n\nBaker said the tool also highlights resource deserts — areas where residents have limited access to essential resources such as food, health care, green spaces or other necessities, often due to factors like historical disinvestment or systemic inequalities — in West Texas, where there are few Naloxone distribution sites.\n\n“It’s definitely something that, as a result of the map, has been brought to TODA’s attention, and we’re working with Naloxone Texas to try to get some more resources in that area,” Baker said. “We’re also working with some of the community paramedicine teams about how we can bring stronger prevention support to the more rural and large land masses.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2024 report from Texas DSHS showed a nearly 20% decrease in fentanyl-related poisoning deaths, with at least 430 fewer Texans dying from fentanyl-related poisoning compared with the previous year. The decrease comes after five straight years of increases, which saw fentanyl-related poisoning deaths in Texas rise by more than 600% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nBaker said TODA collects data on fatal and non-fatal drug poisonings from hospitals, emergency medical services, toxicology reports and death investigation reports, to better understand drug poisonings.\n\nShe said the program plans to create a non-fatal drug poisoning data dashboard in the next few months that will display overdose trends by drug type, age group and other demographic information.\n\n“All of our partners want data,” Baker said. “Our purpose is to utilize that data to inform their local prevention strategies, and then kind of roll all that up to our overall state strategy of supporting the reduction of drug poisonings.”", "source_domain": "statescoop.com"}

Practice size (number of providers) was associated with differences in conditions that provided sufficient aspects for MAT provision. Small (1–2 medical providers), non-private practices benefited from the presence of behavioral health and a clinician with MAT experience. Medium sized practices (3–5 providers) whether private or not benefited from behavioral health, often in combination with a clinician with MAT experience. In large practices (6 or more providers), behavioral health was not a factor while having a clinician with MAT experience mattered half of the time.\n\nMethods: Mixed methods study using qualitative and quantitative data collected from interviews, observations, surveys, and practice-reported data. Participants were staff members from 35 rural primary care practices in Colorado, United States. We qualitatively analyzed the data, then transformed the data, then analyzed it using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA).\n\nPurpose: Opioid dependence and use disorders (OUDs) are serious public health crises resulting in a rising number of opioid-related deaths. Medication assisted treatment (MAT), in this case treatment with buprenorphine, is an evidence-based solution to combatting OUD; however, MAT has been largely unavailable in rural areas. This study investigated what it took to increase MAT in rural Colorado primary care practices.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe opioid epidemic is a major public health problem in the United States (1, 2). Treatment for OUD with buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist at the mu-opiate receptor), naltrexone (an opioid antagonist), or methadone (a synthetic opioid that acts as a full agonist), frequently referred to as medication assisted treatment (MAT), is an effective, evidence-based approach (3, 4). However, only 25% of U.S. adults with OUD receive MAT (5).\n\nEfforts to close this treatment gap, save lives, and improve the quality of life for individuals and communities include engaging primary care, where Americans receive about half of all their health care (6, 7). Primary care practice has been considered a potential mitigator of OUD with their ability to screen, diagnose, and treat patients by a single clinical team (8). MAT can occur in outpatient settings (9) and can leverage existing chronic disease management models embraced by primary care. Prior to 2023, a primary care clinician was required to obtain a DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder. Obtaining the waiver required 8 h of approved training. Once trained, the DEA offered an “X” waiver that allowed the primary care clinician to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. More recently, to increase access to buprenorphine, this waiver has been eliminated so that all clinicians with a DEA license can prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Unfortunately, the implementation of MAT in primary care has been slow, with barriers including misconceptions about the patients needing treatment, stigma, and lack of trained staff (10–13). While the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 eliminated the federal requirement for clinicians to have a special waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD (14), this waiver requirement previously acted as another barrier to MAT implementation (11, 15, 16). Following the trend in other states, only 54% of clinicians in Colorado who had a DEA waiver wrote a buprenorphine prescription that was filled in 2016 and 2017. Further, only 8% of waivered clinicians were located in rural Colorado counties, although rural counties experience the highest rates of drug overdose deaths (6, 17). The literature is silent on why exactly this is the case but this may be potentially due to the overall shortage of medical and behavioral health clinicians in rural areas.\n\nImplementing Technology and Medication Assisted Treatment Team Training in Rural Colorado (IT MATTTRs) is a partnership of researchers, community members, and MAT experts convened to address the OUD crisis in rural Colorado. In Colorado 12 counties have overdose death rates of more than 20 per 100,000 and are among the highest in the nation; seven of these counties are located in the region where IT MATTTRs was implemented (18). IT MATTTRs is a practice and community intervention to improve knowledge and awareness of OUD and increase access to buprenorphine treatment for OUD in rural Colorado primary care practices. Started in 2016 when waivers were still required for OUD treatment with buprenorphine, IT MATTTRs included an evidence-based practice team training on OUD treatment with buprenorphine tailored to rural primary care practices (19–23). Although naltrexone and methadone are also evidence-based MAT, this project focused on buprenorphine because it can be prescribed in primary care. Administering methadone must be done at a Certified Opioid Treatment Program, which are not accessible in our rural study region, and the long withdrawal period of naltrexone was not appealing to clinicians participating in the IT MATTTRs study. For these reasons, this study supported the use of treatment with buprenorphine.\n\nRecognizing the challenges and complexity of organizational change in primary care practices (24), we used Qualitative Comparison Analysis (QCA), a novel analytic method, to conduct a rigorous exploration of the key factors needed to increase the provision of MAT to patients in practices receiving the IT MATTTRs Team Training. This paper describes the results of QCA based on our qualitative and other data collected. Our results build on reports of barriers and contribute to detailed understanding of successful implementation of MAT in rural primary care practices.\n\nMethods\n\nWe obtained approval from the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board to conduct this work. This project was supported by grant number R18HS025065 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).\n\nIT MATTTRs interventions\n\nThe IT MATTTRs study included community-focused interventions (22) and opportunities for clinicians (physicians and advance practice providers) to complete training and obtain the previously-required DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD. The program also provided training to practice teams in rural Colorado to enhance understanding of OUD and OUD treatment and facilitate the implementation of MAT. The training covered the epidemiology of OUD, pharmacology of buprenorphine, neurobiology of addiction, and detailed MAT steps. Forty-two practices were randomly assigned to receive training via the in-person Shared Onsite kNowledge Dissemination (SOuND) Team Training™ model (n = 24) or an Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) tele-health model (n = 18). Described in detail elsewhere (20), the training was offered to all staff and clinicians at participating practices.\n\nSetting and participants\n\nForty-two out of approximately 80 total primary care practices from two regions of Colorado, the eastern plains area (served by the High Plains Research Network, or HPRN) and the San Luis Valley (served by the Colorado Research Network, or CaReNet), participated in the IT MATTTRs study and received the IT MATTTRs Practice Team Training. All practices were in a 24-county region located entirely in rural areas, and 13 of the counties have frontier designation (fewer than 6 people per square mile); combined, this study region geographically covers 37% of the state of Colorado. All counties are designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (25). See Table 1 for a list of available primary and behavioral health resources in study region.\n\nTable 1\n\nTable 1. Primary and behavioral health resources in study region.\n\nParticipants in this evaluation included a variety of practice member roles including at least one medical provider (physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant), one clinical staff member (usually a medical assistant or clinical supervisor) and, if possible, other roles such as behavioral health provider, practice manager, or health educator/care coordinator. Baseline interviews were conducted in 42 practices and follow-up interviews were completed in 35. Two to five individuals were interviewed per practice, depending on the practice size. The IT MATTTRs Practice Team Training reached 441 team members across all practices and roles (out of an eligible 676 individuals) and a total of 108 interviews were completed across all practices. While all members of the participating practice teams were encouraged to attend the team training, some individuals missed the training due to scheduling obligations or staff turnover; however, all interviewees were familiar with the IT MATTTRs study and their practice’s involvement in it.\n\nData collection and instruments\n\nThe data for this evaluation was collected from a variety of IT MATTTRs data sources including baseline observations, MAT Implementation Checklist at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-intervention, and interviews at baseline and 6 months post-intervention. We conducted observations at each practice at baseline (pre-intervention), which captured information such as the physical layout and space, medical record procedure, work teams, and practice atmosphere. The MAT Implementation Checklist was completed by either a clinician or practice manager and measured the level of MAT implementation using a 26-item checklist, at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after the practice team training. Demographic data were collected from individual practice team members who participated in the qualitative interviews using a short survey (age, gender, race/ethnicity and length of time in the profession and at the practice).\n\nWe developed a semi-structured interview guide to determine practice member perceptions and current practices regarding opioid use, OUD, and OUD treatment. The baseline interview guide covered the practice member role, current practices and protocols in managing patients with both regular opioid use and OUD, and goals, concerns and intentions regarding providing MAT to patients in their practice. Follow-up interviews (held after intervention completion) included the same topics as well as practices’ experiences with the intervention and their current procedures and future plans regarding MAT. Interviews lasted 30–60 min each and were conducted by a study team member either in person or by telephone. All interviews were conducted either by a doctorally-trained qualitative researcher or other study team members trained and supervised by that qualitative researcher. Study team members practiced with interviews until they demonstrated competency. Participants were compensated with a gift card. A memo form was completed immediately after each interview to capture key summary points and reflections. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and loaded into ATLAS.ti version 8 (ATLAS.ti GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Baseline interviews and observations were conducted between July, 2017, and September, 2018, and results are reported elsewhere (21). Follow-up interviews were conducted between November, 2018, and January, 2020.\n\nAnalysis\n\nApproach\n\nFor analyzing the baseline data, we used a grounded hermeneutic editing approach (26). This approach is similar to a grounded theory approach but includes editing as an “organizing style of analysis that helps bring forth greater understanding of or meaning from text or data” (26). For the qualitative analysis considering both the baseline and follow-up interview data and other sources of data, we used a variation of a rapid qualitative analysis approach (27–29).\n\nData sources and practice template creation\n\nIn this process, we created a summary template for each practice (see Supplementary material S1). The template covered: practice information, OUD and MAT experience, resources including behavioral health, opioid prescribing procedures, and evidence of diversion (i.e., if interview participants described examples of diversion, or sharing medications with others not prescribed), or inherited prescribing (i.e., assuming opioid prescriptions for inherited patients) as captured in the interviews. An qualitative core team member completed the template after reviewing all the data sources for each practice. The data sources included all the baseline and follow-up interview transcripts, the observation field notes, the fidelity checklist (for MAT provision or referral system), and surveys (for practice demographics).\n\nNext, another core team member checked over the completed template using the same data sources. Any discrepancies were discussed and rectified, which sometimes required revisiting the data and considering new categories on the template for summarization. After a summary template was completed for each practice, overall summaries across practices were considered.\n\nSummary template creation\n\nThen the team discussed the convergence of these summaries noting areas of overlaps and divergence. The team considered the meaning and relevance of results emerging from the data. These data were presented to the larger research team for discussion and feedback, then refined and finalized for consistency and implementation considerations. These efforts allowed the core team to revisit the data, confirm, modify, or refute initial impressions, and identify additional areas for further analysis. Throughout the entire analysis process, the lead qualitative analyst kept a summary document as an audit trail to record the discussion elements and decisions made. The completed summary templates provided the essential information for further analysis.\n\nExplanatory condition identification\n\nNext the analysis team reviewed all the data sources and identified the factors most likely to be related to the presence of the outcome of interest, providing MAT. Potential explanatory conditions were identified based on clinical expertise, literature review, and feedback from the larger IT MATTTRs team. Once the potential explanatory conditions were identified, the analysis team organized the data into an Excel matrix, with the rows of the matrix enumerating the practices and the columns enumerating the explanatory conditions Supplementary material S1. The explanatory conditions included those emergent from the qualitative analysis (such as leadership buy-in), important practice descriptive health system information (such as practice size), and other factors (such as having a behavioral health provider). The qualitative team then reviewed the matrix in multiple passes to highlight and group categories consisting of similar dimensions; these were then reviewed and approved by the larger study team. Corroborating/legitimating occurred through review of existing literature and seeking out of associated experiences to confirm or refute insights from the analysis. After initial analysis identified data to support one theme or interpretation, particular effort was devoted to finding negative or disconfirming evidence, essentially examining the data and looking for alternative explanations or findings.\n\nQualitative comparative analysis\n\nGiven the nature of the data appearing to potentially be configurational, the research team decided to use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) (30–32), an analytical method used to study complex causality and the effects of context. QCA is uniquely useful in determining what combination of factors may contribute to a particular outcome. It may be used to analyze a mix of quantitatively-and qualitatively-derived data and, in contrast to traditional statistical analysis, is not dependent upon random or representative sampling. Based on Boolean algebra, which deals with logical operations (33), QCA is not constrained by degrees-of-freedom restrictions in the way that conventional statistics are and may therefore be applied to samples of arbitrary size (32, 34). To complete the QCA, we used the protocol outlined by Rihoux and Ragin (30). We first reviewed the emergent themes identified in the analysis above, arriving on an initial set of likely explanatory variables (“conditions” in the terminology of QCA). We then rescaled (“calibrated”) these conditions onto a 0.0 to 1.0 scale for each practice. Table 2 presents the conditions and the guide the team used in coding them. The outcome condition was having a formal MAT system, defined as a system for identification of patients suffering OUD along with referral or treatment, behavioral health support/referral, peer support or referral, and follow-up plans. The scores represent the degree to which the practice exhibits the specified condition. The members of the analysis team then independently scored each practice using the coding guide, before coming together to compare and resolve any discrepancies. The final scoring involved going back to the transcripts, recalibrating if necessary, and determining each practice’s final scores. This process was repeated for the outcome of providing MAT. The analyses were conducted using Kirq, a publicly available software package for QCA developed by co-author CR.\n\nTable 2\n\nTable 2. Outcome and explanatory conditions.\n\nThe QCA revealed that a number of conditions hypothesized to increase the provision of MAT were not causally explanatory. Such conditions were both contextual (e.g., is the practice part of a health system network; is the practice designated as a federally qualified health center) and proximate (e.g., does the practice serve a large number of patients with OUD; is MAT already provided in the community). Table 2 lists the conditions that were included in the final analysis; Supplementary Table 1 lists those conditions that were examined but found to be causally unimportant. One condition found to be of particular importance was practice size; the QCA revealed different causal “recipes,” or critical combinations of factors, for providing MAT depending upon whether the practice was small (1–2 medical providers), medium (3–5 medical providers), or large (6+ medical providers). The decision was therefore made to split the data set into three and conduct separate QCAs for the different practice sizes.\n\nAs described by Ragin (32, 34), QCA seeks to identify necessary and sufficient conditions that are related to the presence of an outcome. A unique benefit of QCA is that it is sensitive to issues of causal complexity (that multiple conditions may operate in tandem) and equifinality (that there may be multiple pathways or “recipes” to realizing an outcome). A necessary condition is a condition (or combination of conditions) that must be present for the outcome to occur; its absence prevents the outcome from occurring. A sufficient condition is a condition (or combination of conditions) that, when present, ensures that the outcome will occur. Necessity and sufficiency can be imperfect: it is perfectly appropriate to identify a particular combination of conditions as “almost always” necessary or sufficient.\n\nThe degree to which a given condition or combination of conditions is necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome is measured by two goodness-of-fit metrics: consistency and coverage. Ranging between 0.0 and 1.0, consistency measures the strength of the necessary or sufficient condition. Established standards for QCA use thresholds of > = 0.9 to establish necessity and > =0.8 to establish sufficiency. Coverage also ranges between 0.0 and 1.0 and measures empirical prominence; recipes with higher coverage scores explain a greater fraction of the outcome than recipes with lower coverage scores. A low coverage score may or may not indicate that the necessary or sufficient condition is trivial. There are not standard coverage scores for establishing necessity or sufficiency: a condition that explains only a small fraction of cases may still be substantively important.\n\nTo conduct a sufficiency analysis using QCA, the raw data matrix is first reformulated as a “truth table.” Presented in Table 3, a truth table lists every possible combination of conditions, the number of practices belonging to each truth table row, and the associated consistency score, which expresses the degree to which the cases associated with a particular truth table row exhibit the outcome. Those rows lacking cases (referred to as “remainders”) are omitted to save space.\n\nTable 3\n\nTable 3. Truth tables describing large-, medium-, and small-sized practices providing MAT, sorted by consistency (consistency threshold: 0.80; proportion threshold: 1.0; frequency threshold: 1) remainders are excluded.\n\nAfter constructing the truth tables, software is used to perform a minimization process that identifies and eliminates logically-irrelevant conditions and mathematically reduces the truth table to a set of Boolean expressions.\n\nResults\n\nSome practices were unable to complete follow-up interviews due to practices closing, “shared” clinical staff across multiple participating practice sites, and a small number of practices that chose not to participate in follow-up interviews. We did not include data from practices that did not participate in follow-up interviews, which resulted in 35 practices out of 42 total with complete information. Descriptive information about the participating practices and practice members are shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4\n\nTable 4. IT MATTTRs practice interview participant descriptions.\n\nNecessity results\n\nThe necessity analysis revealed two conditions common to all practices that were providing MAT within 6 months of the conclusion of the study (Table 5). All such practices had a MAT prescriber on staff and MAT system in place, and both conditions exhibited perfect consistency with a consistency score of 1.0. The latter condition is, by definition, trivially necessary for delivering MAT, which is reflected in the relatively low coverage score of 0.39. The relatively higher coverage score of 0.53 for the former condition indicates that while all practices prescribing MAT also have an MAT prescriber on staff, there are also many practices with an MAT prescriber on staff that are not providing MAT.\n\nTable 5\n\nTable 5. Necessary conditions for providing MAT (consistency threshold: 1.0).\n\nSufficiency results\n\nThe sufficiency analysis revealed that practice size was a crucial explanatory condition, with seven different recipes associated with three different practice sizes—two recipes describing small practices, three describing medium practices and two describing large practices. These results are reported in Figure 1 (35), which presents a Fiss configuration chart of seven recipes. In a Fiss chart, the recipes are read vertically, with circles indicating sufficient conditions and diamonds indicating necessary conditions. A filled glyph indicates the presence of a condition and a crossed glyph, its absence. When no glyph is printed, it indicates that the QCA minimization process has identified that condition as irrelevant within the context of the recipe: some practices exhibited the condition while others did not, yet all exhibited the outcome. Overall solution consistency is 0.94, indicating that a practice described by one (or more) of these recipes almost always was providing MAT at 6 months. Overall solution coverage is 0.86, indicating that most (but not all) practices that were providing MAT at 6 months are described by one or more of these recipes.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. Fiss chart describing characteristics of (S)mall, (M)edium, and (L)arge practices providing MAT.\n\nAcross the three practice sizes, all seven recipes share four conditions, indicating that these conditions that their relevance is independent of practice size. In addition to the two necessary conditions identified by the necessity analysis, each recipe also includes the presence of leadership buy-in and a key person driving the MAT program. Note that the fact that these two conditions are common to all seven recipes does not imply that they are necessary for providing MAT. Recall that solution coverage is less than 1.0, which indicates that there are practices providing MAT that are not explained by these recipes; that is, while these two conditions are certainly important to understanding the provision of MAT, the results of the QCA indicate that other pathways to providing MAT are also possible that lack one or both of these conditions.\n\nAmong small practices, an important condition was whether the practice was or was not private. Small private practices providing MAT lacked both a behavioral health practitioner as well as a clinician with previous experience providing MAT. In contrast, small non-private practices had staff members fulfilling both roles. Whether the practices were private or not does not appear to be particularly crucial for medium sized practices; some were and some were not. However, all the recipes describing medium-sized practices included the presence of a behavioral health provider; two also included a clinician with previous MAT experience. Two recipes describe large practices, none of which were private. One recipe describes practices that lacked a behavioral health practitioner and may or may not have a clinician with previous MAT experience. The other recipe describes practices that possess a clinician with previous MAT experience and may or may not have a behavioral health practitioner.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis analysis identified practice characteristics that are present in study practices that participated in a team-based training and were providing MAT. While there were numerous contemporary statewide initiatives to increase OUD treatment with buprenorphine, the communities participating in IT MATTTRs had a significantly greater increase in treatment than the rest of the state, as we previously reported (23). The results of the present study help inform practice-focused strategies to engage primary care in treating OUD with buprenorphine.\n\nSurprisingly, having a MAT prescriber in place was not present across all configurations, and not all practices with a waivered prescriber were engaged in the delivery of MAT. The results of this evaluation indicate that having a waivered buprenorphine prescriber is necessary but not sufficient to provide MAT in primary care practices. Having a key person or champion as well as leadership buy-in surfaced as important elements to MAT provision.\n\nDifferences in configurations tended to split out based on practice size, which may represent a proxy for resources. Interestingly, among small, private practices, neither behavioral health nor a clinician with prior MAT experience were relevant. This may reflect the flexibility of small private practices with clinicians who seek innovations and resources that keep their practice up-to-date and do not need to seek administrative approval to implement innovations. For medium and larger sized practices, the differences in configurations are less striking, with only one of the five configurations demonstrating no behavioral health presence.\n\nThe QCA identified many conditions as irrelevant that were initially expected to matter. Contextual factors like strong perceived community need and lack of a local MAT provider did not appear to be important factors in explaining MAT provision. Nor were health system or hospital affiliation. Similarly, practice change capacity and receiving either the SOuND or ECHO-delivered team training were also not conditions that entered into any configuration. The IT MATTTRs Team Training aims to engage full practice teams, strengthen leadership understanding of the importance and feasibility of MAT in primary care, and identify and activate practice champions, based on findings from numerous studies examining primary care practice improvement. One possibility is that Team Training serves to support these conditions versus standing as its own condition. Further, the comprehensive training may have made other conditions less relevant or necessary for increasing MAT by providing substantial background on the need for MAT in primary care as well as the support required to implement, when the key necessary and sufficient conditions were present.\n\nWhile recent trends in prescribing behavior indicate increasing prescriptions written by primary care clinicians compared to prescribers in other specialties (36–38), continued efforts to provide MAT in primary care are crucial to expanding access to treatment for OUD. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 expanded prescribing authority by eliminating the federal requirements of a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine (14), discipline restrictions, and patient limits. Additional types of professionals such as different levels of substance abuse counselors or psychologists may enhance service provision, however, hiring such professionals in rural areas can be challenging. Additional opportunities for increasing MAT implementation efforts may come from understanding the characteristics of current buprenorphine prescribers. The original Agency for Healthcare and Quality grantees reported several facilitators and barriers to MAT implementation in primary care (19). They report that practice culture related to opioid use stigma and community knowledge of treatment options are important factors in uptake of MAT in primary care. Secular changes in opioid use and abuse culture, with decreased opioid prescribing and increased availability of fentanyl analogs has impacted the opportunity to identify potential patients in primary care practices (39–41).\n\nLimitations\n\nQualitative work inherently is not meant to be inferential; it is intended to provide insight into what the selected group of participants might be experiencing or perceiving. Thus, this population of practices from selected rural Colorado may not be applicable to other rural populations. Even though we had high participation, it is possible that some selection bias may have occurred such that the sample was predisposed toward implementation of MAT. Multiple methods were used to validate the results including triangulation across researchers and multiple analysis methods; however, the results may have bias or misinterpretation of the stories shared in the interviews or through other methods. This study occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, and COVID has had a substantial impact on OUD, overdose deaths, and how OUD treatment is provided. This study does not address that concern.\n\nConclusion\n\nIT MATTTRS was a multi-component intervention for rural Colorado that included practice team training, prescriber waiver training, and community education. Overall, IT MATTTRs resulted in an increase in the number of primary care practices providing MAT through buprenorphine. The QCA results found that, as expected, having a waivered prescriber was necessary prior to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that, while important, prior MAT experience and behavioral health support were not required elements in all cases. In our data, successful implementation of buprenorphine treatment for OUD also entailed the presence of a practice champion and support from practice leadership. However, the QCA did not identify these as necessary conditions, indicating that they may not in fact always be required. Future research should investigate whether buprenorphine treatment for OUD can be successful in their absence and, if so, under which contexts. The results further revealed important differences by practice size, which may help inform practice-focused strategies to engage primary care in treating OUD with buprenorphine.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThe studies involving humans were approved by Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board.

It’s really a day for his family, his friends, and the community.”\n\nThe event was organized by the Forever 41 Committee, including Dakota Dreyer, Devin Tessier, Ryan Thompson, and Arie’s family. Arie and Melissa's children played a central role in making the day possible, with overwhelming support from sponsors across the southeast.\n\nWalsh noted the strength of the turnout. “Right now, we have over 160 golfers and a packed house for supper with a silent auction as well. The support has been overwhelming, and we are truly grateful. Arie was actually one of our own team members, so this means a lot to us.”\n\nThe Forever 41 Foundation was created by Arie’s sons, Austin and Attison Schimmel, following his passing in January. In a statement, they shared their mission:\n\n“We know that nothing can bring back our Dad, but to honour him, we wanted to make it our mission to speak up for Men’s Mental Health and Suicide Awareness. We want to do the best we can to make sure no other family has to go through what we have gone through.”\n\nThe tournament featured strong sponsorship support, including multiple beer hole sponsors, a putting green sponsor, and dozens of donations toward the silent auction.

{"url": "https://news.cuanschutz.edu/emergency-medicine/overdose-dashboard-informs-patient-care", "title": "Opioid Overdose Dashboard Enhances Research and Clinical Practices", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Last week, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), in partnership with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), launched a first-of-its-kind national data dashboard of non-fatal opioid overdoses across the country.\n\nIdentifying populations at-risk for a fatal overdose who would benefit from treatment will help clinicians, providers, and first responders identify resources to improve care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 75% of the nearly 92,000 drug overdose deaths in 2020 involved an opioid. The new dashboard will also help providers and first responders serve populations that need help curbing the opioid crisis.\n\nTwo University of Colorado Department of Emergency Medicine faculty see an opportunity to use the data to focus on local patient impact and care through a research, clinical, and educational lens.\n\nData-informed research and practice\n\nThe dashboard uses data from the National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Information System (NEMSIS) maintained by NHTSA. The NEMSIS data includes electronic patient care records completed by nearly 95% of all EMS agencies nationwide. On average, the data submitted to the national NEMSIS database are 99% complete within two weeks.\n\n“Getting close to real-time data every two weeks is revolutionary for research at this scale,” says Jason Hoppe, DO, lead investigator for the Opioid Research Program and associate professor of emergency medicine at the CU School of Medicine.\n\nHoppe’s research looks to improve safety of prescription opioids, improve decision-making for prescribing opioids, and quantify long-term consequences of prescription opioids. It also looks to evaluate the impact of legislative changes and build a collaborative community to initiate treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) in emergency departments and community clinics.\n\nHoppe anticipates the dashboard will play an important role informing interventions to assist clinicians and providers in providing evidence-based treatment for patients following an overdose.\n\n“One main focus of our research is to track those patients, who have just experienced a life-altering event, after the overdose,” says Hoppe. “When the patient has overdosed, the first responder or clinician will often administer naloxone, a medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose, to give patients a second chance at life. As revolutionary as it is, naloxone is only a bandage on the problem at large. Getting patients into treatment is the long-term fix.”\n\nHowever, tracking those who refuse medical care or those left to make their own recovery plan has been a barrier. With the new dashboard, researchers can see the number of patients who overdosed and weren’t taken to a facility. Non-fatal overdoses are an important time to intervene because 7-18% of patients seen in an emergency room, for a non-fatal overdose, die the following year.\n\nIncarcerated individuals with OUD are also at significant risk upon release from the justice system. Hoppe’s Opioid Research Program has partnered with the Bureau of Justice Assistance and community partners to improve access to treatment that will contribute to these individuals’ success, and hopefully save lives.\n\nPrograms aim to maximize local impact\n\n“The federal strategy behind the dashboard shines a spotlight on the severity of the nationwide issue, but the dashboard itself is unique in that it allows us to identify our local communities at risk,” says Hoppe. “Getting specific data on our populations in the Denver Metro area allows us to have high-level discussions with other health care directors and providers on how to best serve our state.”\n\nHoppe’s research connects directly with first responders, including firefighters, police, and paramedics who serve patients at risk for a second, fatal overdose.\n\nAngela Wright, MD, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the CU School of Medicine and medical director for UCHealth Denver Metro EMS, sees a direct impact of the dashboard for the first responders she oversees.\n\n“This dashboard allows our first responders to sort by state or region and serve areas that may need more resources than others,” says Wright. “The types of resources we aim to provide to areas in need can come in the form of grants, protocol changes, new types of therapies, and safely-administered medications.”\n\nSimilar to Hoppe, Wright believes the dashboard’s tailored data will inform local, high-level change.\n\n“I meet frequently with a group of health care directors in the Denver Metro area to review protocols and develop plans based on our system and state needs. Even though we represent different health care systems, our collective goal is to provide the best possible patient care across Colorado. Having data on hand to make local decisions and discuss trends will be a new, positive asset.”\n\nEducation for first responders\n\nWith federal support to focus on preventing drug-related deaths, Wright sees training and education for first responders as the biggest area for growth in emergency medicine.\n\n“We aim to provide the best education and direction for our first responders, so that when they’re put in the position to serve a patient who’s overdosed, they can feel confident administering each step of care,” says Wright.\n\nWright plans to launch a pre-hospital education program focused on training paramedics in May 2023. The program is a collaboration with UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital and the CU Department of Emergency Medicine.\n\n“There’s a bigger need each year to train the first responder workforce, so partnering with campus resources seemed like the perfect opportunity to launch the program,” says Wright. “Campus-wide partnership is crucial in the success of this up-and-coming program.”\n\nThe connections between Wright’s training goals and Hoppe’s research will ultimately improve care in treating patients to who overdose.\n\n“The ongoing mission to treat opioid overdoses is a collaborative effort to find out the patients’ needs and to know about the available resources,” says Hoppe. “EMS happens to work adjacent to hospital systems, and the treatment can be tricky because the patient is not yet connected to a provider. It can put a lot of pressure on EMS clinicians. My goal is to help lessen that work through evidence-based practices and support the educational piece of training first responders. We want to improve how they’re able to administer care, especially to these high-risk populations.”", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu"}

The launch is in collaboration with The Jed Foundation (JED), a leading national nonprofit that protects emotional health and prevents suicide for teens and young adults, and The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, Texas’s most trusted source for data-driven mental health policy.\n\nHeadstream convened a diverse working group of 12 educational leaders whose collaboration resulted in a Roadmap with 10 key recommendations that can be put into action via the Navigator, a free, web-based resource for K-12 administrators and educators to inform and guide the process of choosing and using digital tools to support the mental health and well-being of students. The Navigator helps guide schools and districts serving adolescents from historically marginalized communities through the digital health product procurement journey with key features, including:\n\nIdentifying Core Challenges: Outlining evidence-based recommended practices for addressing common student mental health challenges.\n\nDiscovering School Success Stories: Understanding examples of successful implementations of digital well-being products in diverse school districts and learning from case studies.\n\nFunding Guidance: Exploring expert recommendations of processes for stakeholder engagement around assessing and selecting digital mental health products and strategies for resourcing initiatives.\n\nProduct Selection: Identifying key considerations to ensure the right product fit, including examples of 20 products that could be used to support youth mental health in schools.\n\nThese solutions come as nearly 70% of public schools have reported that the number of students seeking mental health services has increased since 2020.\n\n“In-person human care and interaction is critical to support student well-being,” said David Ball, Senior Director at Headstream. “However, the resources and capacity don’t currently exist to meet the needs schools face. Technology-based interventions can support counselors, teachers, and schools to address student mental health at scale. The Navigator will walk education decision-makers through product procurement strategies that solve pressing issues like counselor shortages, and early intervention.”\n\n“As a former district leader myself, I have seen the need for innovative and flexible solutions when dealing with the complexity of student mental health. With the Navigator, administrators and district leaders will have a resource to help them make informed decisions on integrating digital interventions into their existing supports and systems for protecting the emotional well-being and mental health of students and school communities nationwide,” said Tony Walker, PhD, Senior Vice President of Academic Programs at JED.\n\n“We all know that schools are searching for solutions to meet the growing mental health needs of students and staff in this country.

But this grant cycle expands the focus.\n\nFunding can now be allocated to address methamphetamine, cocaine and other stimulant use disorders which can’t be treated with medications like opioid addiction.\n\n“It's going to be more traditional, you know, psychosocial therapies,” said Marc Condojani, director of adult treatment and recovery. “Many of those people may need residential treatment, so we wanted to put more money into that.”\n\nIn 2019, 612 people died due to opioids, including prescription pills and heroin, while methamphetamines (and other psychostimulants with abuse potential) accounted for 347 deaths. From 2000 to 2019, Colorado has re-coded 14,512 drug overdose deaths, according to state data.\n\nThe state plans to use some of the funding to support residential treatment for more than 400 Coloradans struggling with stimulant or opioid use disorders.\n\n“Colorado is in an interesting position we have a serious opioid crisis going on. So, we certainly need and have been utilizing the funding they've been giving us,” Condojani said. “But we also have always had a stimulant issue and it has been growing in the last few years as it has nationally.”\n\nGrant monies will also increase the number of recovery residences in the state. Acknowledging the economic downtown cause by the coronavirus pandemic, Condojani said, financial assistance will also be available to residents.\n\n“We'll be able to pay for the first month rent for those people that might be struggling with employment but still need the support of a recovery setting to help them on the path of recovery,” he said.\n\nIn May 2018, the state launched Lift the Label, a state-run public awareness campaign that aims to remove the stigma and labels that prevent people with opioid addiction from accessing effective treatment. While it has been successful, OBH is currently working with a research firm to explore equity and diversity issues related to the campaign. The new funding will allow the department to implement the recommendations.\n\n“We know that our campaign messages are doing a better job reaching some Coloradans over others. So, we are really making it a focus over the next year to expand our messaging, expand change our tactics,” said Elizabeth Owens, director of policy and communications. “Whatever is needed to reach diverse Coloradans and all Coloradans who may need treatment for opioid use disorder.”\n\nOBH will receive $20.8 million per year beginning on Sept. 30, 2020. The grant will also be used for several other initiatives including increasing access to medication-assisted treatment, purchasing and distributing 24,000 kits of the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone, partnering with recovery community organizations and collaborating with the Colorado Hospital Association and CU Practice Innovation Center to help providers treat pain without the use of opioids.\n\n", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org"}

She was unable to open her hand enough for someone to hold it, and was afraid no one would want to try.\n\n“The words ‘graceful’ and ‘cerebral palsy’ are two words that are not typically used in the same sentence,” explained Sarah, an individual with spastic cerebral palsy.\n\nWatch Sarah dance today and you would describe her as graceful. Not only has Sarah become a competitive ballroom dancer, she is helping CU Anschutz researchers explore how cerebral palsy impacts health and mobility in adults.\n\nFollowing a dream\n\nSarah was first inspired to follow her dream after seeing a news report about a blind individual who was able to learn ballroom dancing. She knew the challenges were different from her own, but thought there might be a way for her to learn. She called the dance studio, Colorado Dancesport, and explained her situation. They told her to come in for a lesson—the lesson that she ultimately cancelled.\n\nThings were different six months later when she rescheduled for the eve of her 29th birthday. Despite still being nervous, she was resolved to pursue her dream.\n\n“I stood across from my instructor, held out my hand, and I said, ‘Hello my name is Sarah, I’m 29 years old, and I would like to learn how to waltz.’”\n\nEven though learning to dance proved more difficult than she first thought, Sarah eventually had the dance down. Five months later she and her instructor were performing a tango routine in front of a live audience. After that she entered her first ballroom dance competition.\n\n“I dance because I love it,” said Sarah. “I hope when I dance people see that.”\n\nPeople do see it. They see it when Sarah talks about dancing. They see it when she steps onto the dance floor. They see a lot that can be learned from Sarah’s determination, perseverance and courage.\n\nLearning from Sarah\n\nJim Carollo, director of the Center for Gait and Movement Analysis (CGMA) at Children’s Hospital Colorado, and associate professor in the Departments of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R), Orthopedics, and Bioengineering, also thinks much can be learned from Sarah’s active lifestyle. That is why he invited her to participate in the Cerebral Palsy Adult Transition (CPAT) study.\n\nThe CPAT study is designed to understand how the walking abilities of individuals with cerebral palsy change during the transition from childhood to adulthood. Carollo, along with coinvestigators Patricia Heyn, Amy Bodkin and faculty members from the PM&R Department, are analyzing 70 former CGMA patients to see how their gait and other variables compare to data collected when they were children.\n\n“Some people with cerebral palsy assume that they will have to stop walking at some point,” Carollo said. “They often think it is a natural consequence of the disorder. However there’s no evidence to suggest that. What is important, is to identify and remove biomechanical obstructions to independent ambulation, and thereby avoid falling into a sedentary lifestyle, because there is evidence that that can lead to secondary health conditions, especially in patients with a pediatric condition.”\n\nCarollo theorizes that maintaining an active lifestyle can help to maintain gait and walking ability—ultimately allowing individuals to stave off secondary conditions that accompany a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nThe hours Sarah spends practicing and performing her dance routines could also be helping her to maintain overall health. Sarah was eager to participate in the study since she knew there is little research on adults with cerebral palsy.\n\n“I was excited to learn they were doing research to help people over 18 with cerebral palsy,” Sarah said. “There aren’t a lot of resources for that, and the condition doesn’t go away just because you’ve turned 18.”\n\nThis is a significant problem, according to Bodkin, who noted that the CPAT study is hoping to begin bridging the gap between patients lost during the transition from pediatric care to adult care.\n\n“CP patients tend to get lost between 18-21 years old,” Bodkin said. “This happens to many adults with pediatric conditions. It is a combination of a lack of specialists and lack of insurance, as well as limited access to the healthcare system.”\n\nPassport to health\n\nSeeking to provide an additional resource for CPAT study participants, Carollo, Heyn and Bodkin have created an individualized “health passport” for every participant. The health passport incorporates data collected from the gait analysis as well as lipid and insulin panels, quality of life assessments and other tests to give guidance on how they can live a healthy lifestyle. The passport is presented at a conference with the participant and their family.\n\n“The health passport has been a strong motivator for patients to participate,” Carollo said. “The passport is valuable to them since it provides input on how they might maintain or improve movement going forward.”\n\nCarollo and the CPAT research team plan to conclude the data collection phase of the study by the end of summer 2016. They hope that once analyzed, the data will shed light on adults with cerebral palsy and offer new ideas on how to improve overall health and avoid secondary conditions often reported in this vulnerable population.\n\n“As a person who values measurement, I value being able to test previous patients not as an evaluation of the past, but as a roadmap for the future,” Carollo said.", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu"}

On Sept. 3, 2020, HCSET reached another milestone by launching a pharmacy that will serve its patients. The new pharmacy is operating under the same roof as the Cleveland clinic, located at 307 N William Barnett Ave.\n\nThe pharmacy offers patients who meet certain income requirements and qualify for assistance to receive their prescriptions at vastly-reduced prices.\n\n“Since the Health Center of Southeast Texas is a federally-qualified healthcare center, we are able to offer our patients these prices if they qualify and have given their financials to the clinic. The cost of the medicines is income-based,” said Pharmacy Director Andee Kesner. “The whole point is to have all of these services under one roof. Not every med is available through our 340 B pricing, but there are a lot of different categories of medications, and a lot of drug classes have multiple meds within those classes.”\n\nHealth Center of Southeast Texas Executive Director Steve Racciatto and Dr. Jasmine Sulaiman, HCSET medical director, (second from left) join the staff of the Cleveland clinic’s new pharmacy for an official grand opening ceremony on Sept. 15. Pictured with them are Senior Technician Yesli Salas, Staff Pharmacist Lori Harrison and Pharmacy Director Andee Kesner.\n\nBecause the pharmacy is part of the HCSET’s operation, the pharmacy has access to the patient’s records and works with doctors to come up with the best solution to address the patient’s medical needs.\n\n“We have the ability to go in the system and see what is the best option for the patient, and if we don’t have the medicine that is prescribed, we work with the physicians to see if one of the other meds in the classes will work,” Kesner said.\n\nThe pharmacy is “closed-door,” meaning that it only serves HCSET patients.\n\n“The purpose of a 340 B pharmacy is to break down the barriers to care. Having the pharmacy here, we are able to maintain the patients’ care better and that increases compliance with the patient. They are more likely to take their medications to maintain their health,” Kesner said.\n\nSince the pharmacy opened, staff members have already seen the life-changing impact it is making on patients.\n\n“We have seen patients already who are in shock at the prices for their prescriptions. It’s hard to explain to people why they can get them here so cheap. It’s because we are a federally-qualified healthcare center,” Kesner said. “We have patients paying $10 for a prescription that would have cost $400. We had a patient the other day who used to come in for blood work weekly so he could stay on a med that was cheap enough for him to afford. Now, we are able to offer him a different med that allows him to come in every three months. He also is not out the cost of the labs every week. That is something that would not have been available to him at another pharmacy.”\n\nThe turnaround time for most prescriptions is minutes. By the time patients make the short walk from the clinic to the pharmacy, pharmacy staff members are already working to fill the prescription.\n\nThe Greater Cleveland Chamber of Commerce was part of the grand opening celebration for the Health Center of Southeast Texas’s new pharmacy on Sept. 15. The clinic opened on Sept. 3.\n\n“The average wait time is 10 minutes,” said Kesner, adding that medicines that are not readily available are ordered for next-day service.\n\n“Right now we are finding ourselves ordering a lot of medications because we are still trying to figure out which ones we need to have on hand more often,” she said.\n\nThe pharmacy is unable to fill compound prescriptions at this time, but Kesner hopes to expand in that area as the pharmacy grows. She says patients’ reception of the pharmacy has been better than anticipated.\n\n“We expected it to be amazing but we didn’t know if people would buy in, but they are,” she said.\n\nCurrently, the pharmacy can only serve those without insurance who qualify for assistance through the clinic and self-pay patients, but Kesner says that within the next two months, most major insurance policies should be accepted.\n\nClinic hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on Wednesday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. It is closed on weekends.\n\nAccording to Kesner, HCSET is also looking at adding satellite pharmacies to offer prescriptions to patients at its clinics in Livingston, Liberty and Shepherd. In addition to Kesner, the Cleveland pharmacy is staffed by Yesli Salas, senior technician, and Lori Harrison, staff pharmacist. Bilingual assistance is available.\n\nFor more information on Health Center of Southeast Texas, go online to https://hcset.com/ or call 281-592-2224.", "source_domain": "bluebonnetnews.com"}
{"url": "https://filtermag.org/why-are-methadone-patients-still-being-punished-for-marijuana-use/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Marijuana, which is now legal for medical use in 33 states and counting, can help treat pain—something which opioids also treat. But people with opioid use disorders (OUDs), including those getting treatment with methadone or buprenorphine, may have a hard time getting the pain relief they need (and these days, even people without OUDs have a hard time getting pain relief).\n\nSo why do so many treatment programs—including opioid treatment programs (OTPs, also known as methadone clinics) and office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) providers—test for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis?\n\nContradictions in Colorado\n\nEven in Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize cannabis for recreational use, OTPs are required by state law to test for THC.\n\nTreatment providers there are frustrated by this. Tina Beckley, regional director in Colorado for Behavioral Health Group, said recently that ever since Colorado started requiring OTPs to test for THC in 2006, many patients have lost their take-home doses—often, understandably, having thought that their medical marijuana card would spare them this sanction. Some decided to leave treatment as a result. It was a recipe for chaos and increased risk.\n\nIn Colorado, take-homes for people who receive medical marijuana are limited to those with no history of illicit marijuana use, who had a medical condition that was identified as being treatable with marijuana, and whose primary care providers agreed to the use of medical marijuana.\n\nThese problems began when only medical marijuana was permitted. With the advent of recreational marijuana in 2012, life for OTP patients—and providers—got even more complicated.\n\nMethadone patients use nicotine and alcohol without sanctions, yet the same still doesn’t apply to state-legal marijuana. And this after many methadone patients, according to Beckley, moved to Colorado specifically for the marijuana.\n\nWhat Federal Rules Say—And Don’t\n\nHere’s the catch-22. If an OTP does test for THC, and the sample comes up positive, the OTP can’t necessarily just disregard it. Under some state and clinic rules, the OTP may take steps such as reducing the patient’s take-home doses.\n\nBut there’s no reason to do so, according to the federal guidelines.\n\nEven though THC testing is frequently applied in some states, this testing is never federally mandated except at admission.\n\nIf methadone doesn’t show up in the toxicology reports, there is reason for concern—the patient may be diverting take-homes and foregoing the benefits of methadone. If barbiturates or benzodiazepines show up, there is also reason for concern because of risks to the patient. (But taking barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or other opioids in addition to methadone might mean that the patient is not getting high enough dose of methadone; it does not mean that the patient should be punished.)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that cannabis combined with methadone is harmful. This is why, in the era of medical marijuana, there is little point in even testing for THC in OTPs, and in fact the federal government doesn’t recommend it after the patient’s first visit. Outmoded and outdated state regulations need to be fixed.\n\nEven though THC testing is frequently applied in some states, this testing is never federally mandated except at admission. Both the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Joint Commission, which together accredit and certify OTPs, say OTPs should only test patients for THC once—upon admission. A “Dear Colleague” letter from SAMHSA, which is equivalent to regulation, does not suggest that OTPs test for THC.\n\nBut there is pushback—don’t assume that the federal government supports cannabis for people with OUDs. The SAMHSA letter expresses plenty of concern about potential harms related to marijuana use. And while some states have decreed that cannabis can be used instead of opioid agonists to treat opioid use disorders, this has prompted SAMHSA head Elinore McCance-Katz, MD, PhD, as well as OTPs, to disagree.\n\nAccording to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, however, in states where medical cannabis is legal, the same approaches should apply as are used for other medications. Indeed, other medications may cause some problems for patients taking methadone which cannabis does not cause.\n\nA Psychiatrist Who Prescribes Buprenorphine and Cannabis\n\nLeaving the situation of OTPs and methadone for a moment, let’s consider buprenorphine. It’s not only OTPs, which mainly dispense methadone, that are interested in helping patients by allowing cannabis.\n\nFrederick E. Kahn, MD, a psychiatrist practicing with Forest Recovery in New Jersey, prescribes cannabis for pain in his buprenorphine patients (though patients can’t obtain a medical marijuana card from Forest; they need to have one already).\n\n“If the piece of the withdrawal you’re experiencing is anxiety, maybe [cannabis] can help you.”\n\n“One hundred percent of my patients became addicted to opioids because of having pain problems, mostly chronic,” he told Filter. Complaints included lower-back pain, lupus, neck injuries and autoimmune diseases, he said. In addition, he said some of his patients became addicted following acute pain—they were prescribed hundreds of pills of opioids after, for example, shoulder surgery.\n\nKahn said the cannabis doesn’t help opioid withdrawal specifically—there are other drugs for that—but it can treat anxiety in some patients. “If the piece of the withdrawal you’re experiencing is anxiety, maybe it can help you,” he said.\n\nWhen beginning treatment for opioid use disorder with buprenorphine, his patients have adequate doses within the first 24 hours to treat their withdrawal, he said. Under-medication—a dose that’s not high enough—is responsible for patients feeling withdrawal symptoms, and should not occur with good treatment. This is not always the case with OTPs, which are required by law to start methadone on low doses regardless of the dose the patient will end up on.\n\nKahn does test his patients, including for THC. But he doesn’t use the results punitively. (And he’s not an OTP, so doesn’t have those federal regulations to deal with.)\n\n“If someone is positive and we didn’t know about it, we talk about it with them, see what it’s doing or not doing for them,” said Kahn. “We work with them about it. Toxicology is not there to punish people. It’s there to help guide treatment.”\n\nHow does Kahn know that his patients are not, for example, using the cannabis addictively, but really need it for pain? “That comes from the doctor-patient relationship,” he said. “You can’t tell from the blood level.”\n\nBut you can discuss it. “Ask them how much they’re smoking. We can talk about changing from smoking to either vaping or making some kind of foodstuff because of [lung] problems with smoking anything,” he said. “You can talk about how many times they’re using it a day, how many puffs, how many grams.” The point is to make an active commitment to work together as doctor and patient, he said—and to bear in mind that most of these cannabis-using patients are on fewer opioids for pain.\n\nAt Forest, patients come in voluntarily. “Everybody’s in therapy, so we’re not just handing out buprenorphine—we’re following them closely,” he said.\n\nPeople who work in New Jersey’s cannabis dispensaries usually consult with the patients about strains and potency. But Kahn described this set-up as “the Wild West.” They’re not pharmacists or doctors, he said, “they just work there.”\n\n\n\nContrasting Approaches in New York and Massachusetts\n\nNew York State does not require its OTPs to test for THC. Allegra Schorr, president of the Coalition of Medication-Assisted Treatment Providers and Advocates, the state’s membership association of OTPs, told Filter that there is a very mixed message going out to OTPs about cannabis. Schorr, who is married to Kahn, also heads West Midtown Medical Group, a proprietary OTP based in New York City.\n\n“There’s enough evidence on chronic pain so that we should try this,” said Schorr of medical cannabis for OTP patients. “There are some conditions that we can easily find consensus on.”\n\nAnd she commended the state’s regulatory agency, the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS), for not taking a hardline approach. Many other states have much to learn from this.\n\nMassachusetts, by way of contrast, is another state that, like Colorado, requires THC testing in its OTPs.\n\n“Conquering an opioid addiction is no easy feat for someone chemically handcuffed to narcotic medicines,” said Benjamin Caplan, MD, founder of the CED Foundation and a physician who treats patients at the CED clinic. “In states with medicinal cannabis as an option, we see strong evidence of better results for recovery from opiates: fewer prescriptions, better pain management, less suffering, and better quality of life.”\n\nPeter Grinspoon, MD, has treated OUD patients with cannabis as well. He has a primary care practice affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital. “In the almost-universal anecdotal experience of the patients I’ve treated, cannabis is the most effective medication for withdrawal symptoms from opioid addiction,” he told Filter. “Certainly better than clonidine and lofexidine. This is true whether they are or aren’t in OTP programs.”\n\n“In my personal experience transitioning off of opiates,” he added, “I found cannabis to be profoundly helpful, particular in offsetting the physical symptoms of opiate withdrawal, as well as cravings and anxiety.”\n\nSeeing Cannabis Use for What It Is\n\nAmong many studies on this issue, there have been these findings showing the benefits or lack of harms of cannabis for OTP patients:\n\nCannabis use does not negatively influence opioid outcomes among patients receiving buprenorphine maintenance treatment, with no difference in productivity and quality of life between individuals maintained on buprenorphine with and without current cannabis use.\n\nFor people who use drugs and start opioid agonist treatment, daily cannabis use was associated with a 21 percent greater odds of treatment retention compared with less-than-daily cannabis use.\n\nCannabis use dropped significantly following methadone dose stabilization, and data suggested that objective ratings of withdrawal symptoms decrease in methadone patients using cannabis during this stabilization period\n\nIt’s not that most OTPs necessarily want their patients to take cannabis; many do not. But it should be up to the program’s discretion, they say, not mandated by state or federal governments in terms of testing and sanctions such as loss of take-homes.\n\nAnd emerging evidence that cannabis helps with opioid craving make it even more important to use judgment, and not hard-and-fast rules, about cannabis—especially during an opioid-involved overdose crisis.\n\nRetention in treatment is much more important than keeping people off of cannabis, which—unlike, say, illicit fentanyl—isn’t responsible for any deaths.\n\nPhoto: Sonya Yruel / Drug Policy Alliance", "source_domain": "filtermag.org"}

This means students will finish the training before graduation rather than after, making them eligible to provide medication-assisted treatment sooner.\n\n“Buprenorphine saves lives,” said project director D. Tyler Coyle, MD, an addiction expert and psychiatry instructor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “We want CU Anschutz graduates to prescribe buprenorphine products for opioid use disorder in a safe and effective way. Our team is excited to integrate the Interprofessional Clinical Opioid Use Disorder (ICLOUD) curriculum into the student learning experience.”\n\nBuprenorphine, in conjunction with behavioral therapy, is considered one of the best evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorder. And getting the required training earlier means more health care providers can treat patients who need help.\n\nThe Drug Abuse Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000) increased access to buprenorphine products for opioid use disorder. But before prescribing the drug, health care providers must first undergo at least 8 hours of training to qualify for a DATA waiver. Under the current system, that means getting certified after graduation – which can be time-consuming and difficult for new graduates.\n\n“This grant project comes along when the Child Health Associate / Physician Assistant (CHA/PA) program is already making efforts to transform and update our curriculum, and it fits nicely with many of the other interprofessional opportunities we provide our students,” said Amy Akerman, MPAS, PA-C, assistant professor, academic coordinator and global health track advisor at the CU School of Medicine.\n\nAkerman said the CHA/PA program is committed to treating opioid dependence head on.\n\n“We want to provide our students with the best education and opportunity for practicing skills necessary for treating patients with substance use disorders,” she said.\n\nScott Harpin, PhD, MPH, RN, said the kind of interprofessional education funded by the grant “is the epitome of where health care delivery is going in the future.”\n\n“It’s a natural extension of what we’ve been doing so well here at CU in terms of bringing students together early on in their education to improve systems of care as a model for the future of primary care and prevention,” said Harpin, an associate professor at the CU College of Nursing. “This will allow us to be more agile in responding to Colorado’s needs.”\n\nThe first students are expected to complete the training in fall of 2020.", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu"}

When the storm hit Asheville, North Carolina, it brought heavy rainfall, strong winds and widespread flooding that resulted in loss of life, significant damage and power outages. HCA Healthcare operates seven hospitals and has thousands of colleagues in western North Carolina, many of whom were affected by the storm and its aftermath.\n\nIn response, HCA Healthcare will contribute $250,000 to the United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County to help with immediate natural disaster response and long-term support for flood victims. It will also give $250,000 to the American Red Cross of North Carolina to help support its shelter locations. An additional $500,000 will be donated to other community partners that provide direct support for hurricane-related issues.\n\n“Caring for those in their time of need is our greatest calling at HCA Healthcare, and I am deeply moved by the resilience and compassion of our colleagues. It is our honor to support organizations like United Way and the American Red Cross to help our western North Carolina communities through Hurricane Helene and its aftermath.” Sam Hazen, chief executive officer, HCA Healthcare\n\nHCA Healthcare’s Nashville-based Enterprise Emergency Operations Center, a multi-disciplinary incident response team of nearly 200 leaders, is actively working to provide its western North Carolina hospitals with the resources they need to care for patients and support colleagues in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\nLeading up to the storm, HCA Healthcare activated its Nashville-based Enterprise Emergency Operations Center (EEOC), comprised of nearly 200 multi-disciplinary leaders, including risk management, clinical experts, supply chain, patient logistics, air and ground transport and community liaison representatives. The EEOC is working alongside hospital leadership to distribute key resources to care teams in the Southeastern U.S. before, during and after the catastrophic storm. HCA Healthcare colleagues from across the country, including more than 100 nurses, as well as physicians and HCA Healthcare’s incident support team, are continuing to arrive to provide support to local caregivers.\n\nHCA Healthcare is also a longstanding national partner of the American Red Cross, through its Annual Disaster Partner Giving Program (ADGP), which includes an annual contribution of $500,000, that helps the organization have the infrastructure, resources and technology in place to provide care and comfort to those in need. Over the last eight years, HCA Healthcare has provided nearly $8 million in financial support to the Red Cross for disaster relief efforts, including Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Hurricanes Florence and Michael in 2018, and the Texas winter storms and Kentucky tornadoes in 2021.

As our legislators consider options to reorganize the state’s health and human services agencies, the job will be incomplete unless they also address the critical workforce shortage for behavioral health professionals – a shortage that we at the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute consider a public health emergency.\n\nWe know the impact that mental health disorders have on the people and financial resources of our state. Our own surveys have found that 76 percent of Texans have a close friend or family member who has experienced a mental health need. Approximately 50 percent of all mental health disorders begin by age 14, affecting one-in-five Texas children in a given year and nearly half of Texans across their lifetime.\n\nA significant challenge in getting care to everyone who needs it is that the majority of Texas mental health providers are clustered in just five counties: Bexar, Dallas, Harris, Tarrant and Travis. Of Texas’ 254 counties, 207 are designated as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, and 241 counties have some level of shortage of behavioral health professionals. The most drastic shortages are in non-metropolitan areas, including East Texas, West Texas, the Panhandle, the Rio Grande Valley, and El Paso.\n\nThere are also wide gaps for different types of providers. Texas is the second most populous state with several of the fastest-growing communities in the nation. Yet the overall number of behavioral health professionals falls far short compared to national averages. Texas has 76 psychologists per 100,000 residents, compared to the national average of 129. Similarly, Texas has 253 licensed social workers per 100,000 residents, compared to a national average of 402. The shortages are similarly acute for psychologists, licensed professional counselors, and licensed marriage and family therapists. The shortages grow even more acute when it comes to specialists for children, older adults, minority communities, and people who do not speak English as their first language.\n\nTo improve the wellness of Texans, an adequate and comprehensive workforce of skilled behavioral health professionals is essential. A key strategy to help bridge the gaps in both geographic coverage and provider type will be to rethink education and training for physicians and other health care professionals, as well as incentivizing practitioners who are in scarce supply to relocate and practice in Texas. Texas ranks 31st in the nation for psychiatric residency slots on a per capital basis, and is one of eight states that does not offer reciprocity or endorsement of physicians’ licenses from other states.\n\nThere are several bills before the Texas legislature offering potential solutions. HB 2434 and SB 239 seek to provide assistance with student loan repayment for mental health professionals that commit to practice in underserved regions of Texas. SB18 expands graduate medical education capacity in Texas. HB 661 and SB 190 would authorize participation by Texas in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact for eligible physicians who voluntarily elect to participate.\n\nThe costs of mental health disorders on Texans and their families and for Texas taxpayers are too high to ignore. Building an integrated system of prevention and early intervention services will help reduce those costs; but it will take a robust and skilled workforce to accomplish. As people who call Texas home and pay its taxes, it is incumbent on all of us to care.", "source_domain": "www.tribtalk.org"}

As little as two milligrams — the equivalent of a few grains of salt — can be deadly.\n\nSorrells said the conviction reflects the mission of the Narcotics Prosecution Unit, which he established in 2023 to focus on fentanyl-related and other high-impact drug offenses.\n\nPrevious case led to 19-year sentence\n\nAlthough Lindsay is the first person in Tarrant County to stand trial under the new law, the first individual sentenced under it was Kaeden Farish, a 19-year-old from Azle. Farish pleaded guilty on Oct. 22, 2024, to murder after selling fentanyl-laced pills that caused the death of a 17-year-old. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison.\n\nFather continues to grieve son lost to fentanyl\n\nMeanwhile, Richard Harrison said he hopes the life sentence handed down to Jacob Lindsay sends a message to drug dealers and helps prevent other families from experiencing similar loss.\n\n\"I wake up in the morning, realize my son is dead, grieve, park the pain,\" Harrison said. \"I go to work, put on a fake smile, do what I have to do to make it through the day, then pick it up on the way home. And that's what life is like.\"\n\nDespite the conviction, Harrison said he recognizes the pain extends beyond his own family. After the trial, he visited Lindsay's mother.\n\n\"She blames herself, I'm sure,\" he said. \"Even though we got a life sentence and a murder conviction, I still lost my son. And there's no winners.\"", "source_domain": "www.cbsnews.com"}

Steve Yang, Carlos Robinson (also known as Big R), Chester Gray, Dayla White, Chelsea Hall-Chavira, Juan Mendoza and Louie Gonzales were also indicted.\n\nOf those, only Hyatt and Hall-Chavira were in custody Friday afternoon.\n\nIt’s unclear how the investigation started, but law enforcement relied on surveillance, including GPS on the suspect’s vehicles to intercept drugs though traffic stops. They also intercepted calls allegedly detailing drug transactions, according to the indictments.\n\nWhile the ring trafficked in a variety of drugs, the largest seizures were for fentanyl: Almost 30 pounds of fentanyl, and pills containing fentanyl, were recovered, according to the Colorado Attorney General’s office.\n\n“By holding these traffickers accountable and keeping these dangerous drugs out of our communities, we can save lives in Colorado,” said Attorney General Phil Weiser in a prepared statement.\n\nWeiser’s office said he could not comment beyond the press release, since it is an open case.\n\nThe first named defendant in the indictment, Joshua Hyatt, 37, has a lengthy Colorado arrest record starting back in 2006 when was 18. He has been in and out of prison on numerous charges for motor vehicle theft, menacing and burglary in southern Colorado. He was sentenced to 12 years for a felony robbery that occurred in 2013. In 2020, he was arrested in Pueblo for cocaine distribution and for felon in possession of a weapon charges. He was sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nThree months ago, on Oct. 19, Hyatt was arrested in Adams County — the federal Drug Enforcement Administration is listed as the agency on the case, according to court records. The DEA would not comment on the case, but the Colorado Attorney General’s press release says investigators seized a cache of drugs from a search of his vehicle in October: more than three pounds of fentanyl, more than four pounds of methamphetamine, 126 grams of cocaine, and 87 grams of heroin.\n\nThe indictments come as federal and local law enforcement appear to have stepped up work on large drug cases. According to the DEA, fentanyl pill seizures in Colorado topped 2.8 million in 2024, breaking the previous record of 2.6 million in 2023.\n\nThe DEA helped dismantle a fentanyl and methamphetamine drug trafficking ring in Northern Colorado last March, resulting in the seizure more than 19 pounds of fentanyl, or 85,000 dose units. And in November, the DEA teamed up with Colorado Springs Police and New Mexico authorities on a bust, resulting in the recovery of 670,000 pills.", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org"}

It wasn’t until she began receiving methadone — coupled with therapy, 12-step meetings and other help — that she was finally able to escape heroin for good in 2009.\n\n“I haven’t touched opioids since then,” she said.\n\nAtkins was fortunate. She had access to the evidence-based addiction treatment that research has shown is the best way to conquer the opioid epidemic roiling this country.\n\nIt’s treatment that most Americans addicted to opioids don’t receive, despite numerous studies showing medication-assisted treatment (MAT) helps people kick their illicit opioid habits and go back to living productive, law-abiding lives.\n\nBuprenorphine, commonly sold under the brand name Suboxone, is a synthetic opioid that reduces a patient’s craving for opioids like heroin, fentanyl or OxyContin without giving them a high.\n\nIt also keeps users out of the torturous hell of physical withdrawal, often the downfall of many addicts’ attempts to get clean and sober.\n\nBuprenorphine, approved for use in opioid addiction for two decades, has been shown to lower overdose deaths, reduce illicit drug use, slow the transmission of diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C, prevent relapse and help people stay in treatment.\n\nAfter years of opioid use, Lindsay Atkins was able to get sober with the help of medication-assisted treatment. Credit: Courtesy / Lindsay Atkins\n\nMethadone, which has been around even longer, is a long-acting opioid “agonist” that is used to control withdrawal safely. Another drug, naltrexone, blocks the high from opioids, helping deter future use.\n\nBut these life-saving and life-transforming medications are vastly underused in the United States, condemning untold numbers of people to lives of degradation and preventable deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of Americans continue to die of drug overdoses, which in 2022 once again topped 100,000 deaths, about 75% from opioids.\n\nI was drawn to this issue after reading a recent op-ed in the Washington Post by two physicians decrying the lack of access to buprenorphine and other forms of MAT. They wrote that these medicines are prescribed to fewer than 1 in 6 people who would benefit from them.\n\nThey placed a big part of the blame on the fact that most U.S. medical schools and residency programs don’t provide enough training to young physicians regarding the treatment of addiction, including opioid use disorder.\n\nOne reason: Addiction medicine, they wrote, has been long neglected because of stigma — drug addicts are considered a challenging patient population, known for lying and manipulation — as well as other issues.\n\nI reached out to two psychiatrists who direct the largest medication-assisted treatment program in Bexar County to see if this national-level critique applies to facts on the ground here.\n\n“It’s totally spot-on,” said Dr. Rene Olvera, chief medical officer with the Center for Health Care Services.\n\nThe center’s mostly state-funded ambulatory clinics (2023 budget: $5.3 million) provide buprenorphine and other MAT to some 600 patients at any one time, most of whom lack health insurance. This is just a fraction of the people who could benefit from the treatment, he said.\n\nDr. Rene Olvera is the chief medical officer for the Center for Health Care Services. Credit: Courtesy / Center for Health Care Services\n\n(There are also a number of for-profit MAT clinics and programs in San Antonio, which typically cater to those with insurance or cash to pay for their treatment.)\n\nOlvera said that when he started medical school in 1986, addiction treatment was a relatively new field. Over the last 30 years, it’s been highly regulated, with opioid addiction medications categorized as Schedule 2 drugs, which means doctors have had to mount prescribing hurdles and maintain prodigious record-keeping.\n\n“It was onerous and a lot of physicians didn’t want to bother with it,” he said.\n\nOlvera’s colleague Dr. Christopher Healey, who oversees the center’s MAT program, said doctors have had to apply for a special waiver to prescribe MAT and go through specialized training.\n\n“And because of the regulations, you could only treat a certain number of patients at any time, to guard against doctors overprescribing or creating ‘pill mills,’” he said.\n\nBoth physicians agreed with the op-ed that there hasn’t been adequate training in medical schools, but there are other roadblocks that keep people from accessing the medicine that could save them.\n\nNamely, the expense: Buprenorphine can cost as much as about $300 a month, placing it out of reach for those who lack insurance or work a low-wage job. Even patients who have insurance may find the treatment not covered.\n\n“For many patients in this population, that amount of money is a real challenge,” said Healey.\n\nThe stigma against treating addicts has lessened in recent years, said Olvera, as those in the medical community — and the public at large — have grown to see addiction as a chronic disease, not some moral failing or matter of personal “choice.”\n\nBut compounding the problem is a shortage of psychiatrists, in Texas and elsewhere, which means there are not enough providers to do the prescribing.\n\n“Some psychiatrists may feel they have enough to do dealing with patients who struggle with bipolar disorder, depression or other mental illnesses,” said Olvera. “They don’t want to do the special training to treat this population. They would rather just refer to someone else, although the reality is people without insurance are not going to be referred in the first place.”\n\nThings are slowly changing, the two physicians said.\n\nFor example, a one-year addiction training fellowship at UT Health San Antonio, which had lain fallow, is now drawing more applicants, said Healey, as doctors in training realize they’ll be able to get jobs in addiction treatment once they’re out of school.\n\n(It’s a sort of paradoxical silver lining to the opioid epidemic, he said: The tidal wave of people suffering and dying is drawing more healers to the field.)\n\nPsychiatrists have become more open to non-psychiatrists prescribing MAT, broadening the level of access to the medications, said Olvera. And doctors are coming to understand that substance use disorder and mental illness are intricately interwoven diseases, to be treated concurrently, not as a “chicken or egg” situation, he said.\n\nPerhaps most important, this year President Joe Biden signed into law legislation that, among other things, will make buprenorphine more readily available to those seeking treatment.\n\nNow, physicians no longer will be required to get the special waiver to prescribe Suboxone and will be able to offer it to patients like any other medication.\n\nAlso, Congress has required all doctors to receive eight hours of education on substance use disorders before prescribing controlled substances. (It’s still not enough training, said the op-ed authors.)\n\nProgress has happened locally, too, with programs like Be Well Texas through UT Health San Antonio, which started receiving funding in 2015.\n\nIn addition to conducting research in addiction treatment, providing training modules for physicians and distributing funding to community-based treatment organizations, the Be Well Texas Clinic offers comprehensive care, including MAT, to those seeking treatment, regardless of their ability to pay, via both in-person office visits and through virtual telehealth.\n\nIt’s about time that attitudes are changing.\n\nTreatment with buprenorphine and methadone has been found to cut opioid overdose deaths in half when compared to behavioral therapy alone. MAT for opioid use disorder, especially when paired with therapy and other support, is far and away more effective than traditional programs based on abstinence.\n\nDr. Christopher Healey oversees the Center for Health Care Service’s medication-assisted treatment program. Credit: Courtesy / Center for Health Care Services\n\nProviding recovering addicts with MAT on an outpatient basis is both more effective and cheaper than adding inpatient beds at rehabilitation centers, other research shows.\n\nStill, resistance to evidence-based MAT remains. Outdated beliefs that such treatment entails “just trading one addiction for another” persist in the wider culture.\n\nMany residential or outpatient drug treatment centers in Texas and elsewhere don’t offer it, despite its being available for decades. The folks who run many programs may view such medication as a “crutch,” despite studies that show MAT is more successful at keeping people in treatment than abstinence-based approaches.\n\nSome folks in 12-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous may look down their noses at recovered addicts who use these medicines, going so far as to say they’re not truly sober, because they’re not 100% abstinent. Some sober-living homes and work programs reportedly have rejected people on methadone or other MAT, saying they aren’t “recovered.”\n\nThese mindsets are absurd, bordering on the criminal.\n\nThanks to stubborn stigmas, one study showed it’s far easier to get access to the drugs that started the U.S. opioid epidemic than it is to get help.\n\nNo, MAT isn’t a complete magic pill. Some people relapse on it. It’s not enough by itself: Recovering addicts on MAT need therapy, fellowship and other support to combat the isolation and disconnection that is so much a part of addiction.\n\nAnd, yes, some patients may be on MAT for the rest of their lives. But isn’t that better than dying in an alley, with a needle stuck in your arm?\n\nLast month, Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law measures to combat the fentanyl crisis, including increased penalties for producing and selling it, greater access to the anti-overdose medication Narcan and new programs to increase awareness about the drug’s dangers.\n\nThat’s all well and good, but until we can increase access to the medications that stop people from using illicit opioids in the first place, residents of this state will continue to die.\n\nAtkins, today a human resources manager in San Antonio and single mother to her 15-year-old son, no longer takes methadone. She stays sober by immersing herself in her recovery community. But without MAT, her story could have ended far differently.\n\n“I’m pretty sure I would have kept doing heroin,” she said. “I probably wouldn’t be alive today.”", "source_domain": "sanantonioreport.org"}

It also helps explain associations, such as why diabetes and obesity are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nRichard Johnson, MD\n\n\"In essence, we propose that Alzheimer's disease is a modern disease driven by changes in dietary lifestyle in which fructose can disrupt cerebral metabolism and neuronal function,\" said author Richard Johnson, MD, professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nJohnson outlines data that showcase the overactivation of cerebral fructose metabolism that can drive Alzheimer's disease. The source of fructose is largely from endogenous production in the brain. Thus, the reduction in mitochondrial energy production is hampered by neuronal glycolysis that is inadequate, resulting in progressive loss of cerebral energy levels required for neurons to remain functional and viable.\n\nResearchers hope study can help spur novel treatments\n\n\"By outlining consistent evidence, we're hoping to inspire researchers to continue exploring the relationship between fructose in the brain and Alzheimer's disease. New treatments aimed at inhibiting intracerebral fructose metabolism could provide a novel way to prevent and treat this disease,\" Johnson adds.\n\nIn one of the scenarios outlined by Johnson and his collaborators, glucose hypometabolism increased oxidative stress, and a progressive loss of mitochondria occured, leading eventually to neuronal dysfunction and death. In this scenario, the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are part of the inflammatory response and participate in injury, but are not the central factors driving the disease.\n\nJohnson mentions that theoretically, inhibiting enzymes in the brain that are involved in fructose production or metabolism might provide novel ways to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu"}

And, CareNow, HCA Healthcare’s national chain of urgent care centers, are available to provide our brand of exceptional care in convenient, easy-to-access locations across the nation.\n\nTim Miller, president of HCA Healthcare’s Urgent Care Services, tells us more about the biggest misconception – and the benefits – of urgent care centers and what he learned from one of his greatest inspirations and mentor – the founder of CareNow.\n\nName: Tim Miller\n\nJob Title: President of HCA Healthcare’s Urgent Care Services\n\nHometown: Lewisville, Texas\n\nYears at HCA Healthcare: 2.5\n\nLife before HCA Healthcare: I started my career in urgent care over two decades ago around the time CareNow was founded in 1993. I served in various roles over the years but most recently as president and CEO.\n\nHow would you describe your role: I serve our patients, our physicians, employees and market leaders and together accomplish our mission to deliver quality, convenient, patient centered urgent care that supports HCA Healthcare’s mission to care for an improve human life.\n\nWhen did you get interested in healthcare? I grew up as a missionary kid on an island in the South West Pacific (Papua New Guinea). My mom was a nurse and I had the privilege of often helping her take care of patients who were very sick. The nearest doctor was 500 miles away and she often had to get on the radio and ask for direction on the care of a very sick adult or child with malaria, dysentery or traumatic injury. My first love of healthcare came from her as she dedicated her life to help these people.\n\nThree words to describe urgent care centers: Convenience, Quality and Care\n\nWhat services are offered across HCA Healthcare’s urgent care centers? General illness diagnosis and treatment, quick flu tests, EKGs, x-rays, minor emergencies, scrapes/lacerations, sprains/strains, contusions, eye injuries, burns, sports physicals.\n\nWhat’s the difference between urgent care and ER? Urgent care is great for non-life-threatening problems, such as minor injuries, common illness, rashes, sore throats or sprains and strains. Emergency rooms are for any life-threatening or disabling conditions, sudden or unexplained loss of consciousness, major injuries, chest pain, shortness of breath, high fever with stiff neck, mental confusion or difficulty breathing. Urgent care centers are typically staffed with family doctors and advanced practice providers (APPs) (i.e. nurse practicioners, physician assistants) while ERs are staffed with ER doctors, APPs and specialists.\n\nBiggest misconception about urgent care centers: I think that there is still a misconception as to quality of care. I still cringe when I hear people refer to urgent care centers as “doc in the box”. While this could be true in some urgent care centers, I believe that CareNow, HCA Healthcare’s urgent care centers, offer the highest quality urgent care available in the country. The first element of quality is our doctors, which is why we have a physician-driven model. We also believe that accreditation is fundamental to quality.\n\nWhat do you like best about your line of work? I love urgent care because it allows us to take care of patients during their time of need. I remember when the swine flu hit in September 2009 all of the doctors’ offices in the area were completely booked and patients were in a panic thinking they had contracted a life threatening disease. We saw patients in most of our clinics that year until 1:00 a.m. in the morning. It was a crazy time, but so many patients thanked us for being there for them when they could not have otherwise been seen outside of long waits in the ER. The physicians and staff hold all of the credit as they work tirelessly in their care of the patients.\n\nWhat’s the most important thing you’ve learned over the course of your career? To work hard, be accountable, conscientious and humble.\n\nWho is your biggest inspiration and why? The founder of CareNow David Walter was a great mentor for most of my career. He taught me the importance of humility, the pursuit of excellence and generosity. I remember a couple times over the years we outgrew our existing office space. Every time we moved he gave me the larger office, nicer desk/furniture and chose the small office or in one case, when we were out of space, the storage closet for his office. We had a prayer room that we would meet every Tuesday and pray for the needs of the company. If someone was hurting or had a death in the family he was the first to be at the bedside. The other great inspiration to me was my father. He gave his life to help the poor and suffering. He taught me kindness, gentleness and to serve others.\n\nWhat’s your go-to app on your phone? CareNow’s mobile operating system app that allows me to see the wait times in all of our clinics across the country.\n\nBest way to decompress: Spend time with my wife. I am fortunate that my wife plans great trips for us and we love to travel and experience new places.\n\nWhat’s the best part of your job? The people I work with and the patients we serve. I love coming to work every day and seeing the smiles and hearing the encouraging words.\n\nWhat’s an item on your bucket list? Visiting New Zealand.\n\nWhat advice would you give your younger self? Slow down a little and enjoy life. Invest more time in family and friends. Learn to say “no” more. Work harder.\n\nWhen you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? Many kids growing up in the U.S. want to be police officers or firefighters. For me, the heroes were the pilots who flew in some of the most dangerous conditions on the planet, where people live isolated from the rest of the world, cut off from the most basic necessities. They would deliver medicine and doctors, disaster relief, education, food supplies. I remember holding my breath and watching pilots navigate a box canyon and land in a clearing on the side of a mountain.\n\nWhat’s the future of urgent care centers at HCA Healthcare? We know that across all of the communities we serve, our patients want convenience and to experience healthcare, in non-emergent settings, in ways similar to how they access other services. To meet that need, we will continue to acquire and build new urgent care centers across the nation to provide our patients with a full panel of care options.\n\nVisit here for more information on CareNow® Urgent Care, a division of HCA Healthcare.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

Rudolph\n\nSupporting positive mental health in early childhood is critical to mental and physical health outcomes later in life. One of the best ways to prevent the long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is by fostering responsive relationships between caregivers and children. Since early childhood mental health is inextricably linked to caregiver mental health, caregiver mental illness is considered an ACE.\n\nWhile stress and traumatic events in early childhood are associated with negative mental health status in adulthood, children whose mothers report positive mental health are less likely to develop mental health and behavioral disorders later in life, highlighting the importance of interventions and support for positive caregiver mental health. It’s estimated that approximately 44% of adult depressive disorders could be prevented with the elimination of ACEs.\n\nState, territorial, and freely associated state health organizations have an important role in safeguarding positive mental health in young children and their caregivers. Support for programs and policies that encourage positive mental health in early childhood and provides support for parents and caregivers to have the best chance to improve mental health across the life course. Caregiver and family interventions are critical components of effective mental health therapies for young children.\n\nNational Efforts to Improve Early Childhood Mental Health Outcomes\n\nRecent research and headlines about the early childhood mental crisis have spurned national, state, and local action. The federal government issued a recent letter to states, tribes, and jurisdictions outlining a national plan to align state-level coordination across federal funding streams to advance and expand mental health services for children. The letter describes opportunities for states to address the rise in diagnoses of mental illness in children from 3-17 years old, including leveraging the HRSA Title V Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, and the Administration for Children and Families’ Title IV-E Prevention Program. It also suggests states coordinate and fully utilize mental and behavioral health services and programs covered by Medicaid.\n\nSAMHSA’s Infant Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) grant program also supports mental health in early childhood. IECMH designs programs that serve children at risk of developing or those showing early signs of having a diagnosis of mental illness to improve mental health outcomes for children from birth through age 12. Strengthening caregiver mental health is an important goal of the IECMCH through multigenerational therapy and other services that aim to strengthen caregiving relationships. From 2019 – 2021 alone, over 9,000 young children and caregivers received evidence-based mental health and related services through IECMH. For more information, health agencies can connect with the national center that provides technical assistance to increase mental health consultations throughout the country.\n\nState Examples\n\nIn 2019, in New York state, several state agencies collaborated to create new behavioral health services available for any child aged 0-21 eligible for Medicaid and meeting medical necessity guidelines. These Children and Family Treatment and Support Services were designed to deliver services in the community where it works best for families and children. This approach helps overcome barriers such as access to transportation and childcare for other children. Authorized under Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment benefit, these services include family and youth peer support, therapy, rehabilitation, and crisis intervention.\n\nTennessee’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services manages the new Behavioral Health Safety Net for Children, which provides mental health services to children aged 3-17 who are uninsured or underinsured for behavioral health conditions. As of 2021, services available include but are not limited to assessment and evaluation for a behavioral health concern, individual and family therapeutic intervention, care management, peer support services, transportation, and psychiatric medication management. Administered through community mental health agencies, participants have access to an outreach coordinator and referrals to other behavioral health payor sources.\n\nIn July 2022, Colorado established the Department of Early Childhood to unite Colorado’s early childhood systems and support the health and well-being of all of Colorado’s children, their families, and early childhood professionals. The department supports social-emotional development and mental health through early childhood mental health consultants for providers, parents, and caregivers. The Colorado Early Childhood Mental Health Specialists program focuses on early identification and treatment to help early care providers create environments that support mental health and well-being among children and families. The department also houses the Colorado Early Childhood Mental Health Support Line for parents and caregivers searching for information related to early childhood mental health. It offers videos, print materials, and additional resources to raise awareness and support families’ learning and understanding of mental health.\n\nRecommendations for State and Territorial Health Agencies\n\nRecognizing that rates of early childhood mental health disorders have increased in recent years, assess the status of statewide early childhood mental health. Consider looking for county and township-level trends, if possible.\n\nExpand child mental health outpatient and crisis services in Medicaid. Gathering data on the effectiveness of these services can help make the case with private health plans to cover similar services and further bolster the mental health system.\n\nEngage youth and caregivers in formulating new policy and programming ideas. Ensure that families and caregivers are included in mental health service provision.\n\nEncourage collaboration among state agencies and public and private partners to participate in federal early childhood and caregiver mental health programs such as SAMHSA’s Project LAUNCH, Indigenous Project LAUNCH, and IECMH.\n\nWork with state Medicaid agencies to promote innovative financing arrangements for early childhood mental health services.\n\nAs rates of early childhood and caregiver mental health concerns continue to increase and access to mental health providers is increasingly diminished, health agencies have a responsibility to use available mechanisms to support positive early childhood and caregiver mental health.", "source_domain": "www.astho.org"}

Charlie Health's announcement marks a new, comprehensive mental health treatment option for youth and families in Texas.\n\nCharlie Health is the first-ever virtual mental health clinic to provide access to care for millions of teens, young adults, and families experiencing mental health crises. By partnering with community stakeholders, hospitals, insurance companies, schools, and local therapists, Charlie Health provides individualized treatment for patients who require more than weekly individual therapy or who are transitioning back to home and school after residential or hospital-based treatment.\n\nThe need for accessible mental health care is particularly urgent for youth in Texas: suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth ages 10-24. \"As a native Texan, I've seen firsthand how devastating the lack of mental health resources is here,\" said Amber Buchanan, Charlie Health's Director of Outreach in Texas. \"Research on rural mental health has found that 97% of Texans live in an area where there's a shortage of mental health providers. Charlie Health immediately meets the needs of teens, young adults, and families who are seeking care where they are.\"\n\nSince its initial launch in Montana in September 2020, Charlie Health has expanded services to states across the country. With its launch in Texas––where a quarter of the population is under 18––the company aims to tackle the three main obstacles to mental health care: access, availability, and acceptability. To lower these barriers, the company leverages evidence-based care with accessible, video-based therapy to serve as many high-acuity patients as possible. Rather than group patients together based on their physical location, the company customizes treatment plans by carefully matching patients in groups of peers navigating similar experiences. Patients are also assigned to expert licensed therapists who specialize in their specific needs. Charlie Health believes in the power of healing from home, alongside the patient's support system to ensure a successful and sustainable treatment experience.\n\n\"The fact that Texas' rates of youth depression are higher than the national average and that most of these same young people are living without appropriate support...it's more than tragic. It's unacceptable,\" said Geanne Weaver-Hepler, Director of Outreach at Charlie Health. \"Charlie Health fills a critical gap in the mental health care continuum, and I am thrilled to share its urgently-needed services with our communities in Texas.\"\n\nAbout Charlie Health\n\nCharlie Health, founded in 2020, is the first-ever virtual mental health clinic for high-acuity patients, enabling increased access to care for millions. Charlie Health provides teens and young adults struggling with mental health and substance use disorders personalized Intensive Outpatient (IOP) treatment programs which consist of group therapy, individual therapy, family therapy, and psychiatric support. By providing quality, accessible behavioral health support, Charlie Health ensures that sustainable healing is available to all.

{"url": "https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/texas-war-on-drug-users-fentanyl-overdoses-narcan-austin/", "title": "Texas’ war on drug users", "published_at": null, "full_text": "In the latter half of last century, as states and the federal government increased penalties for drug sale and use, overdose death rates stayed relatively flat. That raised questions about whether deterrence policies did anything to reduce drug use. Then, this century, overdose rates skyrocketed, driven by synthetic opioids including fentanyl. Fentanyl had been around for decades, but in the 2010s it increasingly caused deaths in northeastern states. As it moved west, the nation’s drug supply transformed.\n\nInitially, fentanyl was used alone or to boost the potency of other opioids and depressants like heroin and prescription pain pills. But, in recent years, people killed by fentanyl are increasingly found to have stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamine in their systems. Explanations for this vary. Stimulants may be intentionally adulterated to hook users on fentanyl. A stimulant user might take opioids to come down. An unsophisticated dealer with a small stimulant supply may add fentanyl to stretch it. And failure to clean scales or surfaces can also mix fentanyl with another drug.\n\nIn Texas, overdose rates increased dramatically starting in 2020. From June 2023 to June 2024, more than 5,000 people died of an overdose in the state, with Travis County recording the highest fentanyl-related death rate among Texas’ most populous counties in recent years. Though Texas has one of the lower overdose rates in the nation, deaths in the state declined by less than 3 percent from 2023 to 2024, while the rest of the nation saw a drop of nearly 15 percent, per the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In October, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it recorded a 13-percent drop in the state over the same period—but its figures include only those overdoses deemed accidental, not those labeled intentional, suicide, or of undetermined cause.\n\nExperts also question the general accuracy of Texas’ numbers. In much of the state, underfunded and under-trained justices of the peace are charged with death investigations. Overdoses, which require costly autopsies and toxicology reports, are easy to overlook.\n\nIn response to the overdose increase, HHS in 2017 launched the Texas Targeted Opioid Response (TTOR) initiative. HHS is also part of a state awareness campaign using billboards and social media ads focused on cautionary tales of young Texans who overdosed. At the same time, state leaders have doubled down on criminalization.\n\nIn 2023, the Legislature passed a law allowing prosecutors to bring murder charges in fentanyl overdose cases. Critics say this discourages people from reporting emergencies, and research shows such laws harm public health. Some who overdosed in Austin last April had shared drugs, putting survivors at risk of being charged. In 2021, the Legislature passed a good samaritan law ostensibly meant to protect people who call 911 to report an overdose. The law created a defense for people arrested for low-level possession, but it has so many caveats—you can only use it once in your life, it doesn’t apply if you’ve been convicted of a drug-related felony, you can’t use it if you’ve reported another overdose in the last 18 months—that you’d need a flow chart to understand it. Critics say the statute’s of little use.\n\n“The fentanyl-induced or the drug-induced homicide laws, that jacks up the consequences and the intensity so much more,” said Alex White, director of services at the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance, an Austin nonprofit that does street outreach, operates a drop-in center, and provides supplies including for hygiene and wound care.\n\nSome states, like Maryland and Vermont, make a point of prioritizing input from people who use or have used drugs while crafting policy. Harm reduction advocates say this is lacking in Texas, though HHS does have a low-profile advisory committee that is required to include members who’ve received mental health or addiction treatment.\n\n“If you’re thinking that you know how to serve folks, and you don’t have those folks at the table when you’re trying to serve them, it’s not going to work,” said Stephen Murray, a paramedic and overdose survivor on Massachusetts’ Harm Reduction Advisory Council.\n\nRapid changes in the drug supply can make it difficult to conclusively track policy impacts. Critics blame Texas’ persistent overdose rate at least partly on punitive laws, but a few western states including liberal Oregon—which famously passed a drug decriminalization ballot measure in 2020—actually saw overdoses increase between 2023 and 2024. To this, some experts and at least one study counter that fentanyl’s delayed arrival on the West Coast has distorted the death rates, and that Oregon specifically did not implement sufficient services alongside decriminalization.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\n•\n\nLoretta woke up on the morning of Monday, April 29, in the alley where she often goes to smoke crack and sometimes spends the night. She grew up in East Austin, only blocks away.\n\nLoretta said she lent her pipe that morning to a friend who’d just purchased drugs. Then she heard someone ask, “What’s wrong?” and saw the friend staring up, trance-like.\n\n“He stayed looking at the sky,” Loretta said, reclining and rolling back her eyes to demonstrate. “The next thing I know he just went like this,” she said, as she pantomimed slumping limply to the side. “I was shaking him, and I said, ‘What’s wrong, what’s wrong?’ And after that he just didn’t answer.”\n\nDespite fear she’d be held responsible, Loretta yelled to a friend to call 911. Police and paramedics swarmed the area. Loretta watched as someone else collapsed. “She hurt herself hard on the concrete and I said, ‘Oh, my God, hell no, this is not happening.’”\n\nSoon, an acquaintance ran up to say Loretta’s boyfriend had also collapsed in a nearby portable toilet. “He was slurring like a baby, like a little boy,” Loretta said. “He started to lose consciousness. I slapped him hard. It hurt my hand. And I shook him and I started praying.”\n\nAround the time that Loretta was calling out for help for her boyfriend, and EMTs were trying unsuccessfully to save Gordon, Adam Balboa showed up to work at an Austin-Travis County EMS (ATCEMS) station in south Austin. A case manager for a unit focused on substance use, Balboa heard the overdose reports and symptoms being described and knew what would save the most lives. “We needed to flood the downtown area with as much Narcan as possible,” he said.\n\nOpioids in the bloodstream bind to receptors in the brain, creating euphoria. But by a quirk of physiology, excessive opioids bound to those receptors interfere with the body’s ability to measure its need for oxygen, slowing breathing—to the point where it can be fatal. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation can keep someone alive. Narcan temporarily blocks the receptors to opioids, essentially short-circuiting an overdose if delivered in time.\n\nThe medics and police officers in downtown Austin were running out of naloxone, but Balboa didn’t just want to get them more. He also wanted to get it in the hands of people who use drugs, along with their friends, family, and neighbors. So he and colleagues began throwing together kits containing Narcan, a CPR mask, and instructions, and he hurried downtown with his SUV loaded up with the blue zippered pouches. “Everybody was super receptive,” he said. “They were clipping it to their belts and … going about their normal business.”\n\nAs common-sense as that response seems, it’s one strongly associated with harm reduction. By handing out naloxone downtown, Balboa was helping those most vulnerable to the tainted drugs help one another. It’s also a response that would have been impossible a few years ago.\n\nBalboa’s unit is the brainchild of Mike Sasser, a 51-year-old ATCEMS captain who’s been in recovery for 21 years. A longtime paramedic who often worked with Austin’s unhoused population, Sasser became friends in 2018 with Mark Kinzly, a lion of the Texas harm reduction movement. Kinzly, who passed away in 2022, had helped start the Texas Overdose Naloxone Initiative, which was getting grants to distribute the medication. He had a seemingly simple idea for Sasser: ATCEMS could use grant money to buy Narcan, pass it out, and train people how to use it.\n\n“My mind was blown,” Sasser said. “Why have I never thought about this? That would save so many lives.”\n\nATCEMS doctors then wrote prescriptions that allowed medics to hand out naloxone (today, it’s available over the counter). Sasser’s unit also began reaching out directly to overdose survivors and administering a maintenance drug that reduces opioid cravings, and it now includes two full-time case managers who run an overdose reversal education program called Breathe Now.\n\nAll of this fits under the philosophy of harm reduction, which can also include teaching people to use drugs more safely and providing supplies like clean glass pipes, which help prevent disease and infection. Providing food, water, hygiene products, or wound care to people who feel stigmatized in doctor’s offices is another tenet.\n\n“We want to provide people with what they need, so we can build that trust,” said Em Gray, whose NICE Project provides supplies to Austinites, many of them unhoused, and stocks Narcan vending machines. “That’s how we show that we are there for them; we’re there to improve their quality of life, there to reduce their overdose death rates.”\n\nThere’s little funding available in Texas for the nonprofits and mutual aid groups that do this work. Across the state, harm reductionists often operate out of backpacks or car trunks.\n\nTo the state’s credit, Texas has taken some steps to increase naloxone distribution. TTOR does this with an annual federal grant of about $5.5 million. In 2019, TTOR, whose Narcan distribution program is administered by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, gave about 40 percent of its naloxone to law enforcement agencies—even as research shows it’s more effective to give the medication to laypeople, who are typically first on the scene and present no threat of arrest—an analysis by Texas Community Health News found. By 2022, TTOR’s emphasis had shifted, with law enforcement making up only about 15 percent of its distribution.\n\nBut police are still prioritized in Texas’ long-term naloxone plan. Under a different state program started in April 2023, the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) began distributing $75 million worth of the medication over 10 years. That naloxone, donated by a pharmaceutical company as part of a court settlement over opioid deaths, is largely earmarked for first responders. Of the more than 150,000 doses that TDEM distributed from April 2023 to September 2024, 118,000 went to law enforcement agencies, mostly sheriff’s offices. Many of these offices cover areas that lack other harm reduction infrastructure, but records provided by TDEM show sheriffs aren’t using the naloxone. Of 13 counties in which agencies reported using doses from TDEM by September, the highest rate of use was 3 percent. Much of that naloxone will expire later this year. In an email, a TDEM spokesperson said the agency had “yet to turn down a request for naloxone” and that “Administration or disposition of distributed naloxone is up to the receiving entity how they see fit, in accordance with manufacturer’s guidance.”\n\nWhen it set the state’s two-year budget in 2023, the Legislature allocated an additional $18 million in opioid settlement funds to UT Health San Antonio, but it’s not clear the appropriation will be renewed.\n\nIn the meantime, harm reductionists rely on a patchwork of naloxone sources, including local governments.\n\n“Had we not saturated Austin with Narcan leading up to [the April] event, then that event would have been a lot more detrimental than it was,” said Sarah Cheatham, a peer support specialist with The Other Ones Foundation, an Austin nonprofit serving the unhoused. “Even when it was hard to get in our hands, we were out there doing this communication for months before this happened.”\n\n•\n\nBy late morning on April 29, the Austin Police Department (APD) had some idea what was happening. Crack rocks and pipes had been found at the scene of a number of overdoses in an area known for its use, and officers had interviewed some who’d been revived with naloxone. They began looking for people seen on surveillance cameras and suspected of selling the tainted crack. While responding to an overdose, detectives found one suspect standing in front of a tent, just a block from police headquarters.\n\nWhile cops made arrests, harm reductionists tried frantically to figure out what was going on. A little after noon that Monday, Claire Zagorski, a graduate research assistant at the University of Texas at Austin who’s worked in harm reduction for years, messaged a group chat: “Austin folks there’s a bad batch downtown as of this AM. Not sure on specifics but it does respond to naloxone.”\n\nGroups started handing out Narcan and warning the communities they serve, but without any official information from local governments. “We were really just kind of going in blind,” Cheatham said. “We were all talking to each other about, ‘Who’s going to these camps? Where is it happening? Is it happening downtown?’ And I was mainly reaching out to the people that I know.”\n\nResearch shows that, given the chance, drug users will reduce their risk of overdose—including by carrying naloxone, not using alone, or taking a small tester dose. But, lacking detailed information, harm reduction workers in Austin were constrained. “It’s distressing that the thing that got everyone activated was me being notified by a backchannel,” Zagorski said.\n\nWhen local officials finally made public statements hours after the flood of 911 calls, they only addressed some questions. Whatever was killing people was responding to Narcan, officials said, in a news release and press conference. But they were vague about which drug was adulterated, and there was no mention of test strips.\n\n“It was a very chaotic scene at first,” APD Lieutenant Patrick Eastlick told the Observer. “Something we can look at in the future is, if this happens again, that we reach out to these different groups where we can spread the word.”\n\nOpen conversations about drugs are difficult in a state where top elected officials are cracking down on services for people who use them. In late November, state Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a headline-grabbing lawsuit to shut down a homeless navigation center at a south Austin church. The suit specifically blames the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance’s needle exchange program for “the prevalence of drug paraphernalia, including used needles, littering the surrounding area.” Drug use around the church “fuels criminality, and creates an environment where nearby homes and businesses are at constant risk of theft,” the complaint states.\n\nCritics say efforts like Paxton’s just push drug use out of sight, creating greater risk. “It sends the message to people who use drugs that they should hide it, they should be kept in the dark and in the closet,” said Aaron Ferguson of the Texas Drug User Health Union. “The closet is a very dangerous place for people who use drugs. It’s where overdoses happen. It’s where stadiums full of people die every year.”\n\nAt least two who died in the Austin overdose outbreak were found alone. Family members of at least two others who perished at home told police they didn’t know their loved one had used drugs that day.\n\nHow state officials talk about drug use, critics note, also suggests that only some lives matter. For example, in a 2023 legislative hearing, GOP state Senator Drew Springer—in a successful attempt to woo conservative support for requiring school districts to stock naloxone in middle and high schools—distinguished between different groups of Texas children. “I think the general public, when they hear ‘overdosing,’ they think ‘That’s just a druggie, and that’s a druggie kid’s problem,’” he said. “No, it’s your kid’s [problem], because he may be taking a Xanax or an Adderall” without knowing fentanyl was present.\n\nClaudia Dambra, who runs Street Value, a drug user health organization in Houston, criticized messaging that condemns certain substance users. “All it’s doing is creating more separation,” she said. “It feels like this weird, forced social Darwinism. … It feels like they’re picking us off.”\n\nIn an email, an HHS spokesperson said the agency does not discriminate: “[HHS] substance use programs offer treatment and recovery support for people, regardless of substance use duration.”\n\n•\n\nAfter the horror of watching her boyfriend taken away in an ambulance, Loretta wandered through downtown Austin. Near APD HQ, in the area where police had arrested their suspect earlier, she was offered crack that her friend insisted came from a reliable source. Stressed and scared, she took a hit.\n\n“I started getting a headache right away, like oh, my God, I’ve got a migraine or something. And I started throwing up,” she said. “I said, ‘Call the police, I’m sick.’”\n\nLoretta didn’t lose consciousness, but she was vomiting as police questioned her. Eventually, she was taken to a hospital. She would be among the survivors.\n\nToday, Loretta says that she gets test strips from harm reduction organizations, which quietly distribute them despite state law, and she gives them to friends. But, at the time, she knew little about them. Organizations that distribute strips generally can’t use grant money for their purchase, and government agencies, like ATCEMS, don’t distribute them.\n\nBack in 2023, it seemed Texas was poised to legalize the strips. Before that year’s legislative session, Abbott said he supported allowing the tests, and legislators in both chambers introduced bills to legalize equipment for checking a range of drugs. One by Houston-area Republican Tom Oliverson, which was limited to fentanyl strips only, sailed through the House.\n\nOliverson, an anesthesiologist who has prescribed fentanyl to patients, said he’d heard from family members of people who purchased black-market pills without knowing they included the powerful opioid.\n\n“That’s literally like stepping on a landmine,” Oliverson told the Observer. “You heard a click and the next thing you know, you were gone. Nothing you could have done could have saved you. You didn’t know it was there, right? Except for the fact that there are test strips.”", "source_domain": "www.texasstandard.org"}

That’s according to a new analysis from the American Medical Association, the Colorado Medical Society and Manatt Health.\n\nColorado is one of four states the AMA decided to spotlight with a deep-dive look at what it’ll take to stop the nation’s opioid epidemic.\n\nIn 2013, then-Gov. John Hickenlooper launched a process to develop one of the first statewide comprehensive efforts in the country to address the issue. The efforts included better educating providers about the problem, providing an easier way for people to dispose of their unused opioids and mandating wider use of a prescription drug monitoring program. And in May 2018, Hickenlooper signed a bill to limit how many opioids doctors can prescribe.\n\n“We’re definitely leading the country in my opinion,” said Dr. Jonathan Clapp, a pain specialist based in Greenwood Village.\n\nClapp, who works with a Colorado Medical Society prescription drug abuse committee, said the state has been “very thoughtful as far as not ignoring patients who really are in pain,” while at the same time trying to both keep patients safe and find opioid alternatives.\n\nThe report credits the state in several areas: Colorado adopted policies and funding to help more people get access to medication-assisted treatment. It pushed for insurers to cover addiction treatment and non-opioid alternatives for pain management. And, Clapp said, it expanded access to the overdose drug naloxone.\n\n“This has made a difference,” Clapp said. “I saw a number, an estimate, that already the naloxone has saved thousands of lives in Colorado and I don’t think that’s an understatement.”\n\nDespite all that, the grim toll of the epidemic continues. There’s been a 21 percent drop in opioid prescriptions since 2013 — yet the state’s overdose death rate rose over the last two years. More than a thousand Coloradans died from drug overdoses in 2017, a record.\n\nThe AMA report urges Colorado to expand access to medication-assisted treatment, especially in rural areas. That treatment includes the use of FDA-approved meds like methadone, naltrexone and buprenorphine, along with counseling.\n\nClapp said it starts with eliminating barriers to treatment.\n\n“When someone comes in and wants to get medication-assisted treatment, they want off the opioids, they want to get better, there’s still many payers out there that will not cover their treatment.”", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org"}

He is being held on a $250,000 bond in the Denver Jail.\n\nIn an affidavit prepared by an investigator for the 18th Judicial District Attorney, the case is laid out that Walker sold fentanyl in April of 2023 to Calvin Grace, who overdosed on the drugs days later.

He had been reported missing late one evening in June 2012. Police suspected he was planning to take a bus.\n\nMonths after the attempted escape, late in 2012, he was sentenced to a year in a military prison.

The 26-year-old was found dead a couple of miles from the scene, seemingly from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA couple who survived, Joaquin Ramirez and his partner, Roseanne Solis, told KSAT local news that after an initial hail of gunfire, Kelley went through the church shooting anyone who made a noise, including children.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are trying to determine a motive for the mass slaughter, and on Monday said that there was a “domestic situation” that included threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who was known to attend the church but was not present on Sunday.\n\nInvestigators have so far been unable to access Kelley’s phone because of its security protections and have sent it to FBI headquarters in Virginia, Chris Combs, an FBI special agent, said at a Tuesday news conference.\n\nThe US air force said in a statement on Monday that the base failed to enter the record of Kelley’s domestic violence conviction into the national background check system for firearms sales.

There is one place in your home that may not be on your list to de-clutter and dust, but it should be – the medicine cabinet. Spring is a great time to re-evaluate the safety of your family’s medicine cabinet and clean out your household supply of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications.\n\nConsider this – nearly 80 percent of Americans using heroin right now say they got hooked on prescription opioids first. Could spring cleaning your medicine cabinet be the end of this deadly trend?\n\nWe sat down with Karla Miller, vice president of pharmacy services and clinical therapeutics at HCA Healthcare, for insight on proper medicine storage and disposal to prevent accidental poisonings and overdoses.\n\nWhy is cleaning out your medicine cabinet important?\n\nKeeping unused medications in your medicine cabinet undoubtedly increases the risk for theft of medication and resultant consequences that are likely to occur from this activity, such as calls to poison control centers, hospitalization and even death.\n\nAccording to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, six million Americans misused controlled prescription drugs. This study shows that a majority of abused prescription drugs were obtained from family and friends, often from the home medicine cabinet.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recently provided more data to strengthen the link between failing to discard unused medications and deviant activity. They conducted a national survey that found 53 percent of people 12 years or older who misused prescription pain relievers in the past year obtained the pain relievers most often from a friend or relative. It is important to routinely clean out your cabinet to avoid misuse and medication diversion, sharing and trading medicines, theft of medication, doctor shopping or buying medications from patients.\n\nWhat’s the biggest concern of having old or unused medications?\n\nThe biggest concern of having old or unused medications around the house regards the risk to our pediatric population. The statistics may shock you:\n\nWhat is HCA Healthcare doing in the pharmacy space to ensure medications like opioids, for example, don’t get into the wrong hands?\n\nHCA Healthcare has developed a multidisciplinary Pain Steering Committee dedicated to appropriate use of opioids and multimodal treatment of pain. We are taking multiple measures to minimize the abuse of opioids among our patients by reducing the volume of these medications prescribed. This begins by having a conversation with patients about their expectations for pain management, explaining they may experience some pain after surgery.\n\nHCA Healthcare also recently implemented the Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, which is devoted to maximizing function after surgery instead of heavily focusing on pain management. Our caregivers have often elected to provide non-opioid medications for patients seeking pain relief.\n\nFurthermore, physicians now have access to aggregated electronic health record providing data that will allow them to prescribe medications like opioids judiciously. By the end of 2019 we will have over 2000 physicians electronically prescribing controlled substances. Electronic prescribing of controlled substances decreased the risk of these medications getting in the wrong hands.\n\nIn 2013, HCA Healthcare’s Physician Services Group developed controlled substance monitoring guidelines for its physicians and advanced practice providers. Recommendations include screening state prescription drug monitoring programs, implementing controlled substance agreements with patients and using random drug screens when deemed necessary.\n\nWe’ve also partnered with leaders in our company’s sustainability program to create a continuing education course for our pharmacists and nurses and educational and guidance materials that are shared with the healthcare industry.\n\nWhat are 3-5 tips people can use to safely dispose of their medication at home?\n\nThe safest and most responsible option is to take unwanted medications to a drug take-back site.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) hosts National Prescription Drug-Take Back Events periodically devoted to providing an opportunity for people to discard their unused medications. Local law enforcement agencies may also conduct drug take-back programs.\n\nThe next DEA Take-Back Day observance occurs today, April 27, 2019.\n\nClick here to find a Drug Take-Back Collection Site near you.\n\nHCA Healthcare will be hosting a Take-Back Day in the fall of 2019.\n\nIf you can’t find a convenient disposal site or take-back event in your area, here are some suggestions for safe medication disposal:\n\nCheck the dates on your medications, including ointments, supplements and vitamins. Discard any of these products that are beyond their expiration date due to the loss of effectiveness and potential for them to become toxic. Discard items that have changed color, smell or taste, including those medications whose colors have faded. This indicates that the medication has been exposed to too much sunlight. For prescription medications, follow the “one-year cut off” rule. Discard any prescriptions that are more than one year old. Discard medications that are in unmarked containers, especially if they cannot be identified. In the future, ensure that medications that are still within their expiration date and being used by the patient are kept in their original containers so that they may be easily identified. At HCA Healthcare, due to potential harm to the environment, we take steps to not throw medications out or flush them down the toilet. Similarly, flushing medications down the toilet at home is not recommended. Instead, a method that is available to almost everyone at home is to simply place all medications in a sealable bag. For solid medications, add some water to dissolve them. Then, add items such as coffee grounds, kitty litter, sawdust or any material that mixes well and makes the medication unappealing for children or animals to eat. Seal the bag, and place it in the garbage. After properly disposing of the medication, remove any identifying information on the prescription bottle, clean it, and recycle.\n\nFor more information, check out the FDA’s website on disposing of unused medication, which offers further details on how to safely dispose of certain medications.\n\nHappy spring cleaning!", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

The probe, detailed in a Reuters report via TradingView, accuses the companies of promoting chatbots and AI tools that falsely present themselves as qualified mental health resources, potentially violating state child protection laws.\n\nPaxton’s office claims that Meta’s AI Studio and Character.AI’s conversational bots have been marketed or designed in ways that entice vulnerable young users into seeking advice on serious issues like anxiety, depression, and self-harm, without adequate disclaimers or safeguards. This comes amid a broader wave of concerns about AI’s unchecked influence on minors, where bots might simulate therapeutic interactions but lack the oversight of licensed professionals.\n\nRising Concerns Over AI’s Ethical Boundaries\n\nIndustry experts point out that these AI systems often employ natural language processing to mimic empathy, drawing kids in with personalized responses. However, as highlighted in a recent Yahoo News article, such tools can deliver inaccurate or harmful advice, exacerbating mental health crises rather than alleviating them. Paxton’s investigation builds on prior actions, including a December 2024 probe into Character.AI over child safety, as reported by TechCrunch.\n\nThe Texas AG’s statement emphasizes that these platforms may be engaging in deceptive trade practices by implying their AI offers legitimate therapy. For instance, Character.AI’s bots have been criticized for normalizing extreme behaviors in interactions with teens, echoing lawsuits in Texas and Florida where parents alleged harm to their children.\n\nHistorical Context and Precedents\n\nThis isn’t Meta’s first brush with Texas regulators; in 2022, Paxton sued the company over facial recognition privacy violations, securing a $1.4 billion settlement, per a TechCrunch piece from that year. Now, the focus shifts to AI ethics, with Paxton drawing parallels to past settlements involving misleading AI claims in healthcare, such as the 2024 agreement with Pieces Technologies, announced on the Texas Attorney General’s website.\n\nThat case involved false accuracy claims about AI tools for clinical notes, resulting in enhanced transparency requirements. Insiders suggest Paxton’s current probe could lead to similar outcomes, forcing Meta and Character.AI to implement age gates, content warnings, or even halt certain features for minors.\n\nImplications for the Tech Industry\n\nThe investigation arrives as AI adoption surges, with companies like Meta integrating generative tools into social platforms to boost engagement. Yet, posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect public sentiment, with users expressing outrage over AI chatbots falsely claiming confidentiality or licensure, as seen in discussions around deceptive “therapist” characters.\n\nFor industry insiders, this signals a potential regulatory tipping point. If substantiated, the claims could prompt federal oversight, mirroring the 2023 multi-state lawsuit against Meta for worsening youth mental health, covered in TechCrunch. Analysts predict fines, mandated audits, or design changes that prioritize safety over innovation.\n\nPotential Outcomes and Broader Ramifications\n\nPaxton’s office is seeking documents on AI development, marketing strategies, and user data handling, aiming to uncover if these firms knowingly targeted kids. Character.AI, backed by venture capital, has faced prior backlash for bots encouraging self-harm, as noted in a Washington Post report from December 2024.\n\nMeta, meanwhile, defends its AI as supplementary entertainment, but critics argue it blurs lines with real therapy. This case could reshape how tech giants deploy AI, emphasizing ethical guidelines and child protections in an era where digital companions are increasingly lifelike.\n\nLooking Ahead: Regulatory Evolution\n\nAs the probe unfolds, it may inspire other states to act, building on efforts like the Center for Humane Technology’s commendation of Paxton’s earlier investigations, per their website statement. For now, the tech sector watches closely, aware that unchecked AI in mental health could invite sweeping reforms.", "source_domain": "www.webpronews.com"}

Despite the severity of this issue, the neurological mechanisms underlying opioid addiction, withdrawal and relapse are not fully understood.\n\nA study recently published in Cell Reports sheds light on the subject. Jun Wang, associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics at the Texas A&M University School of Medicine, and members of his laboratory have identified a specific brain circuit that characterizes how fentanyl (a synthetic opioid) affects the brain. Specifically, they looked at the striatum, which is a brain region that controls voluntary behaviors and is heavily implicated in drug relapse.\n\nEven after a long period of abstaining from opioids, many people relapse as a result of the depression, anxiety and other negative emotions that accompany withdrawal. Suppressing these negative emotional states could greatly increase a person’s chance of overcoming opioid use disorder.\n\nOpioid addiction is mainly mediated by mu-opioid receptors (MORs), which are expressed in the midbrain and the striatum on a type of neuron called direct pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs). Previous studies from the Wang lab showed these dMSNs control “go” actions in the brain that promote drug-seeking behaviors. The striatum contains two distinct sub-compartments, the patch and matrix compartments. The patch compartments primarily contain MOR-expressing dMSNs and are widely studied for their roles in emotional processing and decision-making.\n\nThe study aimed to look at how withdrawal from chronic opioid exposure alters the activity of patch dMSNs and their outputs to generate the negative emotional states which may cause relapse. The researchers discovered that fentanyl enhances the activity of dMSNs in the striatum, and during the early stages of withdrawal, inhibitory signals from these dMSNs to downstream targets, such as dopaminergic neurons, were significantly enhanced. Dopaminergic neurons play a major role in addiction as they control motivation, rewarding behavior and emotions. The enhanced suppression of dopaminergic neurons likely contributes to the negative emotions that arise during acute fentanyl withdrawal, as the researchers found that inhibiting these dMSNs can reduce withdrawal symptoms and anxiety-like behaviors.\n\nThe findings of this research provide new insights into the mechanism underlying opioid-induced negative emotional states, and pave the way for potential treatments for opioid use disorders. By reducing the negative emotional states that accompany withdrawal, it may be possible to reduce the risk of relapse and decrease the number of lives lost to opioids.\n\nIn summary, the study provides new understanding of the brain circuits involved in opioid addiction and withdrawal and could lead to the development of new treatment for opioid use disorders.", "source_domain": "stories.tamu.edu"}

It really works,” said Rica Rodriguez, the founder and executive director of Promotores de Esperanza, a community group that distributes the kits.\n\nSpeaking at the announcement made at Denver Health, she said it saved her from overdose three times. “Naloxone saves lives, but access must be equitable. Culturally competent harm reduction is not a luxury, but a necessity…Today I stand before you alive because someone believed I was worth saving.”\n\nMichael Miller, opioid initiative coordinator with Jefferson County Public Health, also spoke of the benefits of the medication. He too is a three-time overdose survivor thanks to naloxone.\n\n“Public and vocal support for this fund has already saved lives. It saved my life,” Miller said. “People like me shouldn't be sentenced to a coffin or to permanent disability. Seconds matter.”\n\nNaloxone saves lives by reversing an overdose from opioids when given in time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioid medication.\n\nOne of its primary benefits is that naloxone is easy to use and small to carry. It comes in two types usable even without medical training or special authorization: prefilled nasal spray and injectable.\n\nThe funds come at a critical moment, Weiser told a crowd at Denver Health’s Center for Addiction Medicine in downtown Denver.\n\nColorado is facing the loss of federal public health funding, thanks to cuts announced by the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Nationally, it chopped a massive sum, $11 billion, that was slated to go to states. Colorado was set to receive nearly $230 million of that.\n\nWeiser and attorneys general from other states sued, winning a preliminary reprieve, but he said with Colorado potentially losing the funding, all bets are off for funding many public health priorities.\n\n“That's now gone,” said Weiser, a Democrat now running for governor. “It is so wrong that the federal government isn't continuing to support, across America, naloxone as one of the most, if not the best proven strategies to fight this epidemic and save lives.”\n\nThe state’s Naloxone Bulk Purchase Fund was previously supported by one-time federal money, he said. The program supplies it to all 64 counties, at no cost to schools, harm reduction groups, law enforcement and other groups.\n\nBut he said a settlement just last week with pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma and its owners the Sackler family, will bring $7.5 billion to states.\n\nIncluding this new settlement, Colorado has obtained agreements committing nearly $870 million from companies that fueled the nation’s opioid epidemic, according to a press release from the Attorney General’s office.\n\nThe Purdue settlement in principle is “the nation’s largest settlement to date with individuals responsible for the opioid crisis.” the release said. Colorado will receive an estimated $75,670,000 from it over the next 15 years.\n\nWeiser said with the administration cutting back on funding research into health disparities, which hit African-American, Hispanic, American Indian and other diverse populations harder, it was important naloxone be fairly distributed.\n\n“I want to acknowledge and lift up that Black and Hispanic communities haven't seen the exact same level of reduction we're talking about today, underscoring the work that we have to do and its connection to addressing inequities,” Weiser said.\n\nThe Attorney General and other speakers stood in front of a chart showing annual fentanyl deaths in Colorado, rising to above a thousand in 2023, then falling well below that last year. Deaths fell nationwide last year.\n\nMore than 1,600 people died from overdoses of all kinds last year in Colorado. But public health officials say wide distribution of naloxone is preventing the number from being much higher.\n\n“While that’s still far too many people, it is encouraging to see that deaths from overdoses decreased 14 percent compared to the previous year,” said Donna Lynne, Denver Health’s CEO.\n\nThe $3 million from the AG's office won't meet the full statewide need for naloxone but it ensures that high priority groups are funded through 2026, according to a spokesman.\n\nBrooke Bender, administrative director with Denver Health’s Center for Addiction Medicine, said the hospital offers naloxone across its entire system. And it recently opened a new vending machine, called VENDY.\n\n“We aim to de-stigmatize addiction treatment and harm reduction tools to make them accessible and to keep people alive and help them thrive,” Bender said.\n\n'It's a nightmare. Everybody in our community is on edge.'\n\nJohn Daley/CPR Rica Rodriguez is the founder and executive director of Promotores de Esperanza, a community group that distributes kits of naloxone, which also goes by the name Narcan\n\nRodiguez, with Promotores de Esperanza, said the funding comes just in time. Her group had seen a $115,000 cut to funding from the city of Denver specifically for Narcan distribution. “So we won't be able to pay our contractors, to be able to do the work,” she said.\n\nWith that grant, her group distributed 5,900 doses of naloxone last year.\n\n“But thankfully with the bulk fund supply, we will still have access to the Narcan and we will make it happen and we'll find funding to make it happen,” she said.\n\nThe sudden loss of a lot of federal funds is hitting the community hard, she said.\n\n“It's a nightmare. Everybody in our community is on edge. Everybody is wondering what's going to happen when I don't have access to Narcan and my son overdoses or my grandson overdoses, or even my grandmother,” Rodriguez said.\n\nShe said knew a grandmother who overdosed because she forgot that she took her pain medicine, then took another one and overdosed, not realizing that she forgot.\n\n“Thankfully, her grandson had been there and had Narcan on board and saved her life,” Rodriguez said. “So everybody's just in total chaos right now. Just wondering what's going to happen, especially with Medicaid funding and all the other cuts that are happening.”\n\nRodriguez said she’s been sober for 19 years, after using heroin and opioids. Three times she overdosed on prescription pills but had the overdose reversed, thanks to naloxone, which was only available on the black market then.\n\n“It is definitely an enabler of breathing. That's all it enables,” she said. “People like to say that it enables drug usage, but it absolutely does not. It just keeps people alive so that we can find a pathway to recovery. And if we're not breathing, then we can't find recovery.”", "source_domain": "www.cpr.org"}

Promoting access to healthcare careers\n\n(January 2023) The HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, announced multiple grants in January to provide high school students early access to careers in healthcare and to connect unemployed and underemployed job seekers with meaningful healthcare career opportunities.\n\nThe HCA Healthcare Foundation is giving $250,000 in total grants to community colleges – including Austin Community College, Metro State University of Denver, Miami Dade College, Pensacola State College and The University of Texas at Arlington – to help high school students learn about various healthcare careers.\n\nIn addition, the HCA Healthcare Foundation is giving $130,000 to the Urban League of Broward County as part of the Healthcare Workforce Enhancement Initiative. Through this grant, the Urban League of Broward County will pilot a workforce development program for those who have been disconnected from the workforce to explore careers in the healthcare field.\n\nRead more: HCA Healthcare announces HCA Healthcare Foundation grants to promote access to healthcare careers\n\n(November 2023) As part of our three-year commitment to give $10 million to historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), HCA Healthcare announced a gift of $620,000 in November to the University of California, Riverside (UCR) with $620,000 to support five scholarships for students enrolled in the UCR School of Medicine. HCA Healthcare has now announced $7.42 million to multiple colleges and universities towards that commitment.\n\nThe gift will fund two Dean’s Mission Scholarship – Merit Program scholarships and three Dean’s Mission Award – Service Program scholarships. Additionally, HCA Healthcare’s Riverside Community Hospital will provide job shadowing, mentorship and continued learning opportunities to recipients.\n\n2. Collaborating with Google Cloud to bring generative AI to hospitals\n\nDr. Alex Stinard uses the Augmedix app on his mobile device during a patient conversation with a patient in the emergency department at UCF Lake Nona Hospital.\n\n(August 2023) HCA Healthcare and Google Cloud announced a new collaboration in August designed to use generative AI technology to improve workflows on time-consuming tasks, such as clinical documentation, so physicians and nurses can focus more on patient care. This expanded work with Google Cloud is part of a strategic partnership announced in 2021 that includes safeguards to protect patient privacy and the security of data.\n\nAs part of a pilot program that began early this year, approximately 75 emergency room physicians at four HCA Healthcare hospitals started using Google’s AI technology to quickly and more easily document key medical information from conversations during patient visits. It is part of a collaboration among HCA Healthcare, Google Cloud, and Augmedix, a healthcare technology company that specializes in ambient medical documentation.\n\nPhysicians use an Augmedix app on a hands-free device to create accurate and timely medical notes from clinician-patient conversations. Augmedix’s proprietary platform then leverages natural language processing, along with Google Cloud’s generative AI technology and multi-party medical speech-to-text processing, to instantly convert the data into medical notes, which physicians review and finalize before they are transferred in real time to the hospital’s electronic health record (EHR). While we are in the process of collecting measurement data, physicians in the pilot program have reported strong overall satisfaction.\n\n3. Crushing the Crisis during fifth annual prescription drug take back day\n\n(October 2023) HCA Healthcare hosted our fifth annual “Crush the Crisis” prescription drug take back day on October 28, 2023. Our organization has now collected more than 67,500 pounds of medication since launching “Crush the Crisis” as an enterprise initiative in 2019.\n\nThis year, all 15 HCA Healthcare U.S. divisions participated alongside local law enforcement in a “Crush the Crisis” prescription drug take back day to raise awareness about the dangers of prescription drug misuse and the importance of proper disposal of unused or expired medications. An estimated 9 million doses of medication were collected at 132 collection sites across 15 states.\n\nHCA Healthcare facility events with the greatest amount of medication collected this year include:\n\nIn addition to “Crush the Crisis” events, efforts to reduce prescription drug misuse and transform pain management include:\n\nEnhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR): a multi-modal approach to pain management using pre-, intra- and post-operative interventions to optimize outcomes. HCA Healthcare’s ESR programs have demonstrated significant improvements in surgical recovery and patient satisfaction.\n\nElectronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS): aims to stem increasing rates of opioid-related addiction, misuse diversion and death by making it more difficult for medication-seekers to doctor-shop and alter prescriptions. Physicians have access to aggregated electronic health records, providing data that will allow them to prescribe opioids judiciously.\n\n4. Investing in clinical education and training for nurses\n\n(May 2023) Providing effective clinical education and career support for our nurses is the first step in delivering high-quality patient care. This year, we announced a more than $300 million in investment to support the education and training of nurses. This includes $200 million towards the expansion of Galen College of Nursing and approximately $136 million towards the opening of new HCA Healthcare Centers for Clinical Advancement. HCA Healthcare has plans to open twenty additional centers in the next three years.\n\nHCA Healthcare’s purchase of Galen College of Nursing in 2020 brought together two of the leading nursing organizations to increase access to nursing education and to provide career opportunities for both students and colleagues. Since joining HCA Healthcare, Galen College of Nursing has announced more than a dozen new campuses and increased enrollment to over 12,000 students.\n\nThe Centers for Clinical Advancement operate independently from nursing schools and are dedicated to helping nurses advance their skills and careers. New nursing graduates use the centers to complete their Nurse Residency program and choose specializations, while veteran nurses can use the centers to earn advanced certifications. From classroom instruction to high-fidelity immersive simulations, the centers are equipped with technology that allows students to learn from clinical experts.\n\n5. Increasing mental wellness education for young girls\n\n(September 2023) As a result of a $1.38 million grant from the HCA Healthcare Foundation to Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) in 2022, HCA Healthcare and GSUSA announced the launch of a series of patch programs designed to increase mental wellness in girls in 4th through 12th grade.\n\nThe GSUSA Mental Wellness Patch Programs, developed in partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the GSUSA Program Advisory Committee, including HCA Healthcare behavioral health experts, are currently available to all councils nationwide. The programs, Knowing My Emotions, Finding My Voice and Showing Up for Me and You, encourage girls to:\n\nLearn about mental wellness for themselves and others;\n\nRecognize and understand their feelings;\n\nEffectively cope with mental health challenges; and\n\nFeel comfortable seeking help.\n\nThe 90-minute programs include activities, such as making art or writing poetry, that foster resilience and help girls to better understand their world. Program materials also contain meeting aids, parent/caregiver resources, teaser activities and marketing tools to equip Girl Scout troop leaders and council staff with support and activities focused on mental wellness, behavioral issues and healthy habits. Each patch program also includes an adult facilitator guide to help adults approach girls in a sensitive way, prompt important conversations and guide them through difficult moments.\n\n6. Moving medicine forward through clinical trials and research\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic inspired renewed public interest in clinical research. But using it to help doctors and researchers learn more about diseases and improve healthcare is anything but novel.\n\nAcross HCA Healthcare, clinical research has brought forth new medications, new ways of doing surgery, new medical devices, new ways to use existing treatments and new ways to improve the quality of life for our patients with acute or chronic illnesses.\n\nWe’re including few of the top HCA Healthcare clinical research stories that made headlines in 2023:\n\n(October 2023) We announced a large multi-state study by HCA Healthcare, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and the University of California, Irvine which found that a nasal antibiotic ointment, mupirocin, which is currently used daily for intensive care unit (ICU) patients in only one-third of U.S. hospitals, is highly effective at preventing Staphylococcus aureus infections in critically ill patients, outperforming an antiseptic solution.\n\nThis study was published in JAMA and involved more than 800,000 ICU patients in 137 HCA Healthcare hospitals and built upon an earlier study among these research partners demonstrating that daily bathing with antiseptic chlorhexidine soap plus nasal mupirocin for all ICU patients prevented many bloodstream and other serious infections. This strategy is called “decolonization” because it reduces the amount of bacteria on the body in order to reduce infection risk. Today, as a result of the previous study, the majority of ICUs bathe patients with chlorhexidine; however, only one-third of hospital ICUs provide nasal mupirocin to all patients, largely due to fears of fueling antibiotic resistance.\n\n(October 2023) We also announced in October that HCA Healthcare’s Johnston-Willis Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, is the first hospital in the United States to provide treatment in a new clinical trial for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. This clinical trial, conducted by HCA Healthcare Research Institute and sponsored by Insightec, a global healthcare company pioneering the use of focused ultrasound technology, investigates the benefit of combining noninvasive focused ultrasound with systemic immunotherapy as an alternative.\n\nJohnston-Willis Hospital is hosting the trial and has already enrolled the first two U.S. patients who are currently undergoing a total of six treatment cycles each. The patients have metastatic brain cancer, which originated from cancer cells spreading to the brain from the primary tumor in their lungs. The new treatment uses Insightec’s system to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which defends the brain against harmful substances, but also prevents critical medications from being delivered. By opening the BBB, non-small cell lung cancer medications may reach and target the critical lesions in the brain.\n\n7. Addressing food insecurity\n\n(December 2023) In December, HCA Healthcare announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund gave $375,000 in grants to nonprofits as part of its new Health Equity Catalyst Grant Program. This year, the grants were given to nonprofits addressing food insecurity and providing access to healthy foods across the country.\n\nLaunched for the first time in 2023, the Health Equity Catalyst Grant program provides one-time operating grants to support organizations and collaboratives addressing health inequities in a defined focus area in order to advance or accelerate efforts to:\n\nProvide culturally and structurally competent services,\n\nAdvance high-impact health equity programming,\n\nSupport collaborative health equity efforts, and/or\n\nAddress root causes of health inequities.\n\nThe fifteen nonprofits receiving this year’s grants are focused on key food insecurity issues, including improving access to nutrient-dense fresh food, providing locally grown produce and job training opportunities, and advancing culturally congruent health education.\n\nIn addition to these grants, HCA Healthcare hosted our third-annual Healthy Food for Healthier Tomorrows Food & Nutrition Drive to help fight against food insecurity. HCA Healthcare, our colleagues and the HCA Healthcare Foundation provided more than 1 million nutritious meals to community food banks by donating food or making financial contributions to help purchase perishable items such as milk, fruit and vegetables.\n\nFor this year’s food drive, hospitals were encouraged to get creative and build sculptures with the donated food before transporting it to their local food banks. The sculpture winner in each division received a $10,000 grant for the food bank serving their community. In addition, there were three national winners selected to receive an additional grant to a food bank in the hospital’s hometown to make an even greater impact.\n\n8. Preparing and responding to natural disasters\n\n(August 2023) On August 30, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend as a Category 3 major hurricane, before moving into Georgia as a Category 1 hurricane and pushing into South Carolina as a tropical storm. As destructive winds and heavy rainfall progressed across all three states, HCA Healthcare colleagues stood ready to serve those who needed care. Long before a hurricane makes landfall, HCA Healthcare’s disaster response team prepares to ensure continuity of care.\n\nThe Nashville-based EEOC responds to approximately 900 events annually and is comprised of nearly 200 multi-disciplinary leaders, including risk management, clinical experts, supply chain, patient logistics, air and ground transport and community liaison representatives. During hurricane season, EEOC leaders leverage strategic partnerships with weather forecasting agencies and utilize real-time alerting technology to continuously monitor threats and evolve response plans and programs.\n\nHCA Healthcare activated its Nashville-based Enterprise Emergency Operations Center (EEOC), comprised of nearly 200 multi-disciplinary leaders, including risk management, clinical experts, supply chain, patient logistics, air and ground transport and community liaison representatives. In advance of Hurricane Idalia, the EEOC worked alongside local leadership to prepare by distributing key resources to our hospitals, so that colleagues remain safe and patients continue to receive quality care.\n\nWorking across HCA Healthcare’s network, the EEOC can redirect the company’s supply chain to get medical supplies, equipment and care teams to impacted areas to offer assistance. The EEOC prepositions resources, including temporary generators, bulk water and fuel supply. This year, HCA Healthcare stationed Incident Support Unit Trailers equipped with 3,000 Flood Control Barriers and storm readiness equipment, in both its Gulf Coast and West Florida divisions.\n\nIn the event of an evacuation, the company uses EvacuNATE, an algorithm developed by HCA Healthcare, which helps to reduce hospital evacuation time using real-time triage data to track every patient’s movement and where alternative care is available.\n\n(December 2023) In December 2023, we also announced that HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are donating $250,000 to aid those impacted by the tornadoes that recently hit Middle Tennessee. The tornadoes, which touched down the afternoon of Saturday, Dec. 9, 2023, devastated multiple counties across Middle Tennessee, destroying homes and leaving thousands without power.\n\nAdditionally, the HCA Healthcare Hope Fund, an employee-run, employee-supported 501(c)(3) charity that provides financial aid and resources to employees after extended illness, injury, disaster or other special situations, is providing grants to HCA Healthcare colleagues impacted by the tornadoes.\n\nRead more: HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation donate $250,000 to aid tornado relief efforts in Middle Tennessee\n\n9. Advancing comprehensive cancer care with multi-cancer early detection screening\n\n(October 2023) We announced a strategic collaboration with Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute, part of HCA Healthcare, and GRAIL, LLC, a healthcare company with a mission of detecting cancer early when it can be cured, to advance comprehensive cancer care through early detection. On October 17, 2023, GRAIL’s Galleri® multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test was made available to patients who meet screening criteria at select HCA Healthcare physician practices.\n\nMore than 600,000 people die from cancer each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. This is in large part because some of the deadliest cancers are found too late when outcomes are often poor. Recommended screening tests save lives, but only cover five cancer types in the U.S.: breast, colon, cervical, prostate, and, in high-risk adults, lung. In fact, approximately 70% of cancer deaths have no recommended early detection screening.\n\nThe Galleri test, available by prescription only, is the first clinically validated MCED test that can detect a shared cancer signal across more than 50 types of cancers using a simple blood draw. The MCED test offers a fundamentally different blood-based approach intended to be used in addition to recommended single cancer screenings.\n\nRecognizing the Galleri test is a new paradigm in cancer screening, Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute will leverage its leading nurse navigation program to support patients and providers through the diagnostic journey following a positive Galleri test result. Plans to enhance patient experience and outcomes include standardizing patient and provider education, developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways, and facilitating timely evaluations.\n\nHCA Healthcare is also participating in the PATHFINDER 2 multi-center interventional study of the Galleri test in Nashville, Asheville, Austin, and Denver. The company’s research partner, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) and its contract research organization, will conduct a retrospective study focused on patient and provider outcome-based metrics and quality of care related to MCED testing as part of the initiative.\n\nRead more: HCA Healthcare and GRAIL collaborate to advance comprehensive cancer care with multi-cancer early detection screening\n\n10. HCA Healthcare NICU patients attend prom together\n\n(June 2023) HCA Healthcare has a long history of prioritizing and working to continually improve perinatal safety including Developing evidence-based perinatal protocols through the company’s longstanding partnership with March of Dimes, such as prohibiting elective delivery prior to 39 weeks to help babies have a healthy start to life. This best practice has now been adopted worldwide as a standard of care.\n\nThe story of two HCA Healthcare neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients and March of Dimes families went viral in 2023, detailing how they “met” as newborns in the NICU at The Children’s Hospital at TriStar Centennial in 2005 went viral. Nearly 18 years later and despite living 200 miles away from each other, the two NICU grads attended prom together this spring.\n\nLeighton was born at the Nashville, Tennessee-based hospital on Aug. 22, at 28 weeks, weighing a little over two pounds. Tatum was born three days later at 24 weeks, weighing just over 1 pound. Once Leighton and Tatum’s families were introduced to each other, they developed a special bond. In addition to the supportive and compassionate care provided by the hospital’s NICU nurses, their mothers found encouragement and life-long friendship in each other.\n\nAfter the families left the hospital, they told Good Morning America that they remained close over the years meeting up for birthday parties, day trips and play dates. It was Tatum who decided to ask Leighton to her senior prom. Leighton was quickly on board with the “cool” idea, and his parents even surprised Tatum with a limo rental for the special occasion. This milestone was a special one for their moms, who recall their babies once being so small and fragile.\n\n“It is because of each and every nurse that we get to see our babies grow and have such a beautiful friendship. We owe it all to TriStar Centennial.” Laura, mother of HCA Healthcare patient, Tatum\n\nHCA Healthcare nurse Jamie Horton cared for Tatum the day she was born. She now serves as a NICU manager in the 60-bed, Level III NICU caring for babies who are born at less than 32 weeks gestation or are critically ill. The NICU offers a wide range of lifesaving medical services, including life support, pediatric surgical care, respiratory therapy, access to pediatric physician specialists and air transport.\n\n“Seeing this bond between former NICU patients, such as Tatum and Leighton, cements my passion for a job and a NICU that I love so much. I chose to be a NICU nurse to help be a voice for these babies and their parents and to do all I could to make sure they have healthy and wonderful lives ahead of them,” said Jaime. “They started life with a challenge and have no doubt they’ll handle any other challenge that comes their way. I got to see how tiny Tatum was and how tiny and critical she was on that first day of life. I’m not surprised she is who she is today because she started out as a really strong young lady as a baby, and watching her grow into that has been rewarding.”\n\nGood Morning America article: Tennessee teens, former NICU neighbors, attend prom together\n\nStories to make you smile\n\nJust as a family does, we pull together to care for, support and celebrate with patients and each other. Across HCA Healthcare, we saw a number of stories about the remarkable people at the bedside of our patients resonate with our followers on social media this year. Here’s a look at HCA Healthcare’s top feel-good news stories from 2023.\n\nHCA Healthcare nurse learns baby she helped deliver two decades ago is her daughter-in-law\n\nMary Ann West has been a dedicated labor and delivery nurse with HCA Healthcare affiliate MountainStar Healthcare for more than 25 years. She is one of the nurses proud to welcome the more than 218,000 new babies delivered across our organization annually. This year, Mary Ann experienced a moment of pure serendipity when she discovered that she helped with one very special delivery 22 years ago at HCA Healthcare’s Lakeview Hospital in Utah — her daughter-in-law.\n\nMary Ann’s son, Tyler, and his fiancé Kelsey were looking through old pictures ahead of their May wedding for a slide show when Tyler recognized the nurse who was caring for Kelsey…it was his mother. Mary Ann told Good Morning America the coincidence is remarkable. “What are the odds that these two kids would find each other and end up getting married and starting their own little family,” said Mary Ann.\n\nThe labor and delivery nurse said she remembered the day Stacy, Kelsey’s mother, was in labor at Lakeview Hospital due to her nervousness about having three kids under five years old. Additionally, Mary Ann remembered her due to a rare condition Stacy had called velamentous cord insertion – a complication that occurs in about 1% of single-birth pregnancies. “I remembered Kelsey’s birth because I had never experienced labor like this, before or since. We were all relieved and happy when everything went perfectly and Kelsey was born healthy, without complications. She really is a miracle, and it really does feel like it was meant to be.”\n\n“To be able to have both of my moms there with me when I was brought into the world is something that not everyone gets to say, and that’s something that I’ll be forever grateful for, that I have that connection with her and that she has that connection with my mom, too,” said Kelsey.\n\nHCA Healthcare cancer survivor officiates oncology nurse’s wedding\n\nEach day, our colleagues build strong relationships with their patients during their care journey. This year, we shared the story of how HCA Healthcare patient and cancer survivor Julie Marshall fulfilled her nurse’s wish by officiating her wedding after the two developed a special bond.\n\nDiagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma in the summer of 2021, Julie went through intense treatments of chemotherapy at the Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute at Johnston-Willis Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. During her six-cycle treatment, she formed a close relationship with her care team, which included one of her nurses, Tiffany Knepshield.\n\nWhen Tiffany learned that Julie was a chaplain, she was her first choice when it came time to find someone to officiate her wedding. “Standing on that dock, pronouncing her and her husband as husband and wife was just an honor for me,” Julie recalls.\n\nNow in remission, Julie continues to keep in touch with Tiffany and her new husband. Julie also regularly visits the hospital where she was treated to visit her care team and performed a “Blessing of the Hands” ceremony during National Nurses Week.\n\n“Our relationships with our chemo patients don’t stop after they finish their cycles,” Julie said. “They’re all a family and we love them so much. It’s awesome to have that connection outside of work. Julie will always be a part of my life now.”\n\nRead WRIC article: Patient officiates her nurse’s wedding after the pair became friends during cancer treatment\n\nHCA Healthcare nurse celebrates 90th birthday and half a century of caring for our patients\n\nEvery day, nurses influence strategies and decisions related to patient care, share best practices and make a difference. For more than 50 years, registered nurse Mattie Schier has served patients at HCA Healthcare affiliate St. David’s Medical Center. Catching the spotlight on HCA Healthcare’s social media channels, Mattie’s fellow colleagues surprised her with a celebration in honor of her 90th birthday.\n\nIgniting her passion for healthcare, Ms. Mattie decided to pursue a career in nursing after learning more about the field from her mother, a licensed vocational nurse. She began working at the Austin, Texas, hospital in 1972 as a nurse in the operating room.\n\nOver the years, she has served in a variety of roles across multiple surgical specialties. Today, she works on the central sterile processing team ensuring surgical instruments are sterilized and prepared for surgery. “I’ve always loved being a nurse,” Mattie shared. “I really love interacting with the patients.”\n\nMs. Mattie is a three-time cancer survivor — battling breast cancer twice and colorectal cancer once. She’s drawn on her personal experiences to give hope, encouragement and compassion to her patients. Mattie shares that throughout her cancer journeys, her hospital family was there for her every step of the way with unwavering support. “They have just been so wonderful to me and I feel like I need to be wonderful to them and work as long as I can,” Mattie said.\n\nGeorgia HCA Healthcare hospital throws wedding for burn patient\n\nHCA Healthcare patient Preston Cobb and his future bride, Tanesha, had their wedding date marked for July 22, 2023. However, their wedding plans were paused when Preston suffered a severe chemical spill accident on June 30.\n\nPreston was brought to HCA Healthcare affiliate the Joseph M. Still (JMS) Burn Center at Doctors Hospital of Augusta for specialized burn care for the severe burn injuries sustained on 32% of his body. Preston began his hospitalization on a ventilator in the burn intensive care unit (ICU) and eventually required 16 surgeries.\n\nDue to his accident, Preston and Tanesha thought they would have to postpone their wedding date but the JMS Burn Center colleagues were not going to let that happen. Wanting to create a memorable day for Preston and his bride, the hospital team organized a wedding — complete with a DJ, decorations, a cake, flowers and a photographer. Their family and friends stood by their side at the hospital as they exchanged vows in the hospital’s chapel.\n\n“I wanted to be able to give Preston his wedding day since he was adamant about not changing his date,” shared HCA Healthcare nurse Mary Cook. “I know a lot went into planning his original wedding and I thought if I could do this for him, it would keep his spirits up and give him hope to hold on to because his road to recovery will be tough. I just wanted to give him and his family something positive.”\n\nRead USA Today article: Georgia hospital throws wedding ceremony for couple after groom is severely burned before his big day\n\nNurse’s words of compassion become lifeline for patient\n\nAn act of compassionate care during the pandemic led to a special patient-caregiver reunion in 2023. On January 17, 2020, critical care nurse Lisa Whittaker came to work to care for patients in need as she has for the past 30 years – five of which have been spent at HCA Healthcare’s Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful, Utah. One patient she cared for that night claims that Lisa is the reason she found the strength to keep fighting to live today.\n\n“I started coming down with these symptoms that I’ve never felt before,” Jennifer recalled, reflecting on the onset of her illness and respiratory failure. The immense pain caused by respiratory issues still lingers vividly in her mind and ultimately required her to be placed on a ventilator in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Lakeview Hospital. The severity of Jennifer’s condition eventually caused her to lose consciousness.\n\nAmid the commotion around her, Jennifer remembered a voice that deeply resonated with her. “Somebody was in my ear saying, ‘I’ve got you, you are okay.’ I thought it was an angel,” said Jennifer, who spent 10 days in a coma. When Jennifer woke up, she recalled everything that Lisa said on the first night of her coma, January 17. Lisa’s comforting words of reassurance that everything would be okay helped her to fight, despite the severity of her condition.\n\nJennifer recovered and was discharged from the hospital on January 31, 2020, without knowing Lisa’s name. Early this year – more than three years after leaving the hospital – Jennifer returned to the with a picture of herself in a hospital bed with the nurse who had given her the strength to keep fighting – determined to find the nurse with whom she shared this special bond and to say ‘thank you.’ During National Nurses Month 2023, the two were able to reunite for Jennifer to deliver those words in person with a hug.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}
{"url": "https://news.cuanschutz.edu/nursing/44-too-many-colorados-bold-response-to-pregnancy-associated-overdose-deaths", "title": "33 Too Many: Colorado's Bold Response to Pregnancy-Associated Overdose Deaths", "published_at": null, "full_text": "In Colorado, a silent crisis is claiming the lives of expectant mothers at an alarming rate. From 2016 to 2020, 33 pregnant and postpartum individuals died from unintentional overdoses—a number tragically comparable to those who died from HIV (36) in the following three years from 2020-2023.\n\nWhile these figures might appear small in isolation, they represent preventable deaths that are driving a disturbing trend. Unintentional overdoses have surged to become the second-leading cause of pregnancy-associated deaths in Colorado, with rates nearly doubling from 15.6% in 2016 to 26.2% in 2020, according to the state's Maternal Mortality Review Committee.\n\nThese aren't just statistics—they're children who grow up without their mothers, families forever changed by preventable loss. This growing crisis has prompted the University of Colorado College of Nursing to take action through their Recovery Coach Doula Program, which is now expanding beyond the Denver metro to reach pregnant people across the Front Range. Services made possible through a $700,000 Opioid Response Strategic Impact Grant from the Colorado Attorney General’s Office will reach—in addition to the Denver Metro—Fort Collins and Pueblo.\n\nRecovery Coach Doula Program Partners Integrating Care for Women and Babies (ICWB): a practice facilitator program at CU Anschutz focusing on people with substance use disorder and helping establish relationships with clinical settings that provide care to pregnant and postpartum individuals with substance use disorder.\n\nElephant Circle: A birth and reproductive justice organization is partnering with CU Nursing to train additional recovery coach doulas.\n\n“It’s huge that the state recognizes the program and the need for funding so it can expand and offer essential services,” CU Nursing Assistant Professor Brie Thumm, PhD, CNM, RN, MBA, FACNM, says. “Substance use is not limited to just Denver or the Denver metro. It’s an issue that needs to be addressed across the state.”\n\nThe grant will fund the program’s expansion for two years, offering support surrounding all phases of pregnancy to more Coloradans. CU Nursing has been collaborating with partners since October 2024 to establish referral systems and coordinate logistics so that doulas can start offering services in early March.\n\n“Our goal is to expand more broadly into Colorado’s rural and frontier communities, so expanding to Pueblo and Fort Collins is the first step since they’re bigger population areas,” Thumm says.\n\nHow the Program Works\n\nThe Recovery Coach Doula Program supports pregnant people with substance use disorder during pregnancy, birth, and the first year after birth. Trained recovery coach doulas (also known as peer support specialists) with specialized doula training meet with patients to offer emotional and physical support, help them adjust to life in recovery, and give insights on pregnancy, birth, substance use, and recovery.\n\n“A recovery coach doula is someone who’s in long-term recovery from substance use disorder,” recovery coach and doula Britt Westmoreland says. “We use our lived experience and education to support our patients with advocacy and wellness. We also focus on other things like how to find a job, forming healthy relationships, and relapse prevention.”\n\nPatients are referred to the Recovery Coach Doula Program through their prenatal clinics and hospitals.\n\n“Everything is based on the request and needs of the patient. They’re the ones driving the conversation,” Westmoreland says. “The services are based on how frequently the client wants to see us, and so is the form of communication, whether it’s in-person or virtual.”\n\nA Blueprint for Success\n\nPart of the expansion also includes funding from Colorado’s Behavioral Health Administration to study and implement a blueprint for the program to develop in Colorado and beyond. Liza Creel, PhD, who does healthcare policy research with the CU School of Medicine, will help study the program’s sustainability.\n\n“We’re figuring out how all of the support and services we’re developing at the Anschutz Campus can reach people in different settings,” Thumm says. “There are challenges for sustainability in rural areas, including geographic dispersion of clients and client volume, so we need to research how to make this program sustainable for not only clients but employees.”\n\n“This has always been one of my long-term goals,” Westmoreland says. “The grant funding is showing enough people want us to succeed. I’m hopeful in the future we can use this blueprint to expand services not only in Colorado but in other states.”", "source_domain": "news.cuanschutz.edu"}

Here, a female patient in her 50s finishes up appointments with Dr. Amelia Vitrosko and Cynthina Conner, a behavior health counselor. She meets with both providers to receive buprenorphine, a type of medication-assisted treatment.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment, or MAT, combines therapy, social services and medications to treat opioid addiction. Experts says it’s the gold-standard of treatment.\n\nVitrosko and Conner work together to address a patient’s physical and social needs.\n\n“Dr. Vitrosko and I collaborate extensively,” said Conner. “We share clinical impressions with each other and then formulate treatment plans based on that.”\n\nThere are three types of MAT, and they are defined by the drugs are the core of their treatment: naltrexone, methadone and buprenorphine. Naltrexone blocks the opioid receptors, so a person can’t get high, while methadone and buprenorphine are long-action opioids that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn the early 1970s methadone maintenance programs became a major public health initiative to treat opioid addiction. The drug is heavily regulated and by law can only be dispensed at an opioid treatment program (OTP) which has been certified by the federal government. In methadone programs, patients typically go to an OTP every day to receive a liquid dose of methadone which must be drunk in front of a nurse. This daily routine can be a deterrent for people who want to treatment.\n\nBuprenorphine was approved by the Federal Drug Agency in 2002 as a less potent and more accessible alternative to methadone. The drug is prescribed by a health care provider and picked up at a pharmacy. Buprenorphine can be administered at several locations including hospitals, correctional facilities or clinics like Salud Family Health Center.\n\nThe health center has 20 MAT patients in their program, which is currently available at only three of its locations – Fort Collins, Longmont and Commerce City. Salud provides integrated primary care which includes an array of services including dental, pharmacy, behavioral health, medical, care managers, transitions of care staff and onsite digital xray.\n\nYajaira Johnson-Esparza, director of the MAT program, said Salud’s model reduces barriers to treatment because patients are not referred to another program to receive addiction treatment.\n\n“The approach that we kind of take, instead of sending someone to go somewhere and detox, let’s get them started on this medication,” said Johnson-Esparza. “Try to set them up for some kind of success.”\n\nCredit Colorado Health Institute / Colorado Health Institute Medication-assisted treatment centers in Colorado.\n\nDespite evidence proving the success of MAT programs, it’s not readily accessible in Colorado. According to a report released by the Colorado Health Institute, 31 of the state’s 64 counties do not have a MAT location and an additional 15 counties only have one. This means more than half a million Coloradoans have no or few treatment options for opioid addiction.\n\n“I think the important thing to remember when we’re talking about opioid dependence, is that recovery is possible,” said Teresa Manocchio who authored the report. “And to get people into long-term recovery, we do need to get them into treatment.”\n\nThe barriers extend beyond having specific locations. To prescribe buprenorphine, health care providers must complete a training course and receive a waiver from the federal government.\n\nAt Salud, only 12 percent of their providers have the waiver. Across Colorado, less than 400 providers are licensed.\n\nThe state is working to bridge the treatment gap. In September, Colorado received a $2.9 million federal grant to expand opioid addiction treatment to 17 health centers around the state.\n\nA bi-partisan group of state lawmakers are addressing the lack of MAT through a group of bills planned for the 2018 legislative session. One of the bills would create and fund training for MAT programs, while the another improves prior authorization standards for addiction treatment, making it easier for individuals to get care.\n\nDemocratic State Sen. Irene Aguilar said the latter bill will allow an opioid user, who comes to the emergency room, to get buprenorphine for five days without consent from an insurance company.\n\n“Prior authorization in connection with counseling would be set up so that if people came in, say after an overdose, and were ready to quit,” said Aguilar. “They could be started on treatment immediately.”\n\nMedication-assisted treatment is a long-term treatment, so Conner and Vitrosko don’t rush their Salud patients into the program. Patients need to be aware of the requirements and how the medication works before starting buprenorphine.\n\n“(We) make sure that they’re in that stage of change where they’re ready to commit to a program like this,” said Conner.", "source_domain": "www.kunc.org"}

I was taking care of myself mentally and physically. My relationship was solid.”\n\nThen, during a routine medical exam while serving in the military in California, doctors discovered he had Atrial Fibrillation, or AFib.\n\n“Atrial fibrillation is a rhythm disorder of the upper chambers of the heart during which the upper chambers lose the mechanical function, so they don’t contract,” Andrea Natale, M.D., executive medical director of the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute (TCAI) at St. David’s Medical Center, said.\n\n“Suddenly everything changes, and I’m not able to work out anymore. I may not live as long as I expected,” Wiseman said. “These were all emotional shocks for my wife and me to learn.”\n\nIn just five years, Wiseman underwent 10 cardioversions, four ablations and one failed surgery to treat his AFib, but all were unsuccessful.\n\n“After my third ablation, the cardiologist that I have out in Denver, they looked into alternatives to where I could go across the country and they were saying, ‘We’ve done the best we can. We don’t want to take any more risks than we feel comfortable taking. We’re going to send you to the best guy that we have in the country,’” Wiseman said. “So they sent me to Dr. Natale.”\n\n“The typical age of a person with AFib is about late 50s, early 60s, so Ryan is clearly an exception, but this is a genetic disease,” Dr. Natale said. “Unfortunately, because the upper chamber is not contracting, AFib can increase the risk of stroke and heart failure.”\n\nAFib is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting millions of Americans. AFib can cause blood to pool and form clots in the left atrial appendage (LAA). If a blood clot breaks loose, it can travel to the brain, causing a stroke.\n\nApproximately 20 percent of all strokes occur in patients with AFib, and AFib-related strokes are more frequently fatal and disabling. The most common treatment to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AFib is the use of blood-thinning warfarin medication. Despite its proven efficacy, long-term warfarin medication is not well-tolerated by some patients, and it carries a significant risk for bleeding complications.\n\nAs a result, doctors decided to close Wiseman’s LAA mechanically using the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device.\n\nThe WATCHMAN Implant is a permanent implant designed to close the LAA to keep harmful blood clots from the LAA from entering the bloodstream. By closing off the LAA, the risk of stroke may be reduced, and over time, patients may be able to stop taking warfarin.\n\n“Imagine an umbrella that springs out and closes it,” Dr. Natale said.\n\n“To eliminate my stroke risk and not have to be on blood thinners anymore—that’s huge for me,” Wiseman said. “Being able to go back to running and not having to worry about falling down or somebody hitting me in the chest. I make jokes about it with friends, ‘Hey don’t hit me in the chest. I’m on blood thinners, I might die.’ To a certain degree, it’s kind of funny, but also at the same time it’s a real life-threatening risk that if I fall down some stairs, I may not get back up.”\n\n“This is true for any patient, not just Ryan, but for him, it’s more important because he’s a young parent, so he has to take care of young kids— and at the same time, he has to make sure he can financially provide for his family,” Dr. Natale said. “So it’s actually very important.”\n\nNow, at 32 years of age, Wiseman has bounced back.\n\n“I feel really great, which is an awesome place to be,” Wiseman said. “When you have atrial fibrillation, your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently and, in general, you feel bad. And in general, I feel good—which is awesome.”\n\nThe WATCHMAN was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2015. Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute was involved in clinical trials to study its effectiveness in the United States for nearly a decade, and it was the first facility in Texas to implant the WATCHMAN device in a patient with non-valvular AFib in 2015.\n\nSt. David’s Healthcare, an affiliate of HCA Healthcare, is a network of hospitals in the Austin, Texas area.", "source_domain": "hcahealthcaretoday.com"}

For resources and support, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, or text HOME to 741741 to connect to the Crisis Text Line.\n\nA new initiative from Children’s Health and Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute has in its first year expanded mental health services to more than 150,000 families in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nThe pediatric mental health initiative launched in 2022 to train primary care doctors to assess anxiety, depression and stress in the kids they treat.\n\nSabrina Browne, an assistant professor of psychiatry at UT Southwestern who also works in the behavioral health program at Children’s Health, headed up the initiative.\n\n“Pediatricians and others in pediatric primary care are in such a great position to have those conversations with families and de-stigmatize mental health,” Browne said. “This is something we want to address as part of your everyday healthcare.”\n\nThe catalyst for this pediatric consultation model was in 2020, with the state’s Child Psychiatric Access Network (CPAN). Browne answered questions from doctors all over Texas who were looking for help diagnosing, treating and referring patients to psychiatry and psychology services.\n\n“We had an epidemic in children’s mental health before the pandemic, but once the pandemic hit, it just really opened up the floodgates,” Browne said. “There’s just not enough child psychiatrists out there.”\n\nLack of mental health care services in Texas\n\nThe nonprofit Mental Health America ranks Texas among the 11 states in the country where youth have higher rates of mental health issues and less access to care.\n\nAccording to data from the federal Health Resources & Services Administration, more than 130 of Texas’ 254 counties are designated as mental health professional shortage areas. That means people in more than 50% of Texas counties may not be able to find a mental health care provider when they need it.\n\nAnd Browne said mental health issues have been building for kids since 2020. According to reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emergency department visits “increased for self-harm, drug poisoning, and psychosocial concerns” for kids ages 5-17 throughout the pandemic, in comparison to 2019.\n\nTeen girls were especially impacted: They had emergency visits for suicide attempts 50% more in 2021 than in the same time period in 2019.\n\nChildren's Health Sabrina Browne and Mia Best have both trained about 75 pediatric health professionals to discuss and detect mental health issues in their patients. \"We really focus on early intervention and prevention,\" Browne said. \"We really want to catch kids before they end up in a crisis. We're hearing that our providers are feeling more comfortable to start addressing some of these issues. It's been really exciting.\"\n\nOver the past year, Browne and her colleague, Children’s Health pediatrician Mia Best, have trained 75 health professionals in Dallas-Fort Worth through online modules and in-person case study discussions.\n\n“One of my passions and main goals with this initiative is bringing mental health back into the idea of overall health and wellbeing,” Browne said. “We’ve done a disservice in trying to separate out physical from mental health, because the two are so intertwined.”\n\nBest said she knows how overwhelmed pediatricians can get, and how important it is to carve out a space for learning, growth and community-building.\n\n“We’re really talking about children’s lives and their emotions,” Best said. “We also are going through things ourselves as providers. It’s really hard because we put our heart and soul into treating these kids and making sure their lives are better. When sometimes it doesn’t go as planned, how are we coping with that?”\n\nBest said integrating care helps providers, patients, and patient’s families, especially when treating issues of generational trauma and social determinants of health.\n\nBoth she and Browne are recruiting more health providers to participate in the initiative, which runs quarterly, and hope to expand the program beyond Dallas-Fort Worth in the coming years.\n\nGot a tip?

First providing officers with the medicine so they could use it when responding to an overdose call, then as \"leave behind kits\" that officers could leave with people they believed could be at risk of an overdose, and now with the three vending machines.\n\n\"Our first vending machine is at the Coalition for the Homeless, and we stock that at least twice a week,\" Jacoves said. \"We have a dedicated coordinator and a network of volunteers that make sure that at all times there are kits in these machines.\"\n\nCBS\n\nWhile the nonprofit cannot track use of the kits and how many lives they've potentially saved, Jacoves said at minimum they've given more than 200 people a second chance at life. Still, the nonprofit is often questions if naloxone in free vending machines around the city is enabling drug use.\n\n\"This is such a common misconception,\" explained Stader, \"but we've done scientific studies, but also common sense, to inform us. Comparing naloxone to something that enables drug use is the same as labeling an AED as something that enables heart attacks, or an EpiPen as something that enables someone to get allergies. Naloxone enables one thing and one thing only, naloxone enables survival.\"\n\nEach dose costs about $25, but its ability to save a life is priceless to Stader.\n\n\"People often ask that sustainability question -- how are you going to fund this? And I think from a public health perspective, there is nothing more effective than $25 to save a life,\" he said. \"If someone has to be reversed from an overdose 100 times, that is still cheaper than one emergency department visit for an opioid overdose.\"", "source_domain": "www.cbsnews.com"}

Capt. Jordan Simonson, 21st Medical Squadron psychologist, opened his office door Monday and is slated to begin treating patients in early October.\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin native did his undergraduate work in psychology and sociology at the University of Wisconsin and completed his doctorate in clinical psychology at Seattle Pacific University.\n\n\n\nHe earned his Air Force commission soon after, then spent a year in residency at Joint Base Andrews, Md.\n\n\n\n\"Residency was pretty intense,\" Simonson said. \"It's all about making you an Air Force psychologist through clinical practice. You work extremely long hours and treat a lot of patients. During the year, you conduct group and individual therapy, alcohol and drug treatment and other kinds of behavioral medicine.\"\n\n\n\nThe avid cyclist and runner found it difficult to contain his excitement upon learning of this assignment.\n\n\n\n\"I'm looking forward to riding and running here in Colorado and now I've got the chance to ski and do more mountain-oriented activities,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSporting activities aside, Simonson is most excited about his new job and duty station.\n\n\n\n\"While I was in residency I hoped I might get the chance to start a new program, but figured I would instead be assigned to an existing unit where I would serve as the youngest psychologist,\" he said. \"I feel extremely fortunate to get this opportunity. I couldn't have hoped for a better first assignment.\"\n\n\n\nHere, Simonson will treat patients, but he also has an opportunity to develop a mental health program from scratch.\n\n\n\n\"Very few Air Force psychologists come right out of residency and get to have their own program. That's pretty cool. There will be some challenges such as figuring out all of our operating procedures and all of the hiccups that come with starting something new. So, at this point I'm trying to smooth out the bumps along the road and get up and running,\" Simonson said.\n\n\n\nHe said one of the biggest draws to working as an Air Force psychologist was knowing of the urgent need. And, he's looking forward to the opportunity to deploy in the future.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's important in many circumstances to provide mental health treatment as early as possible,\" he said. \"Early treatment has shown to be most effective for people who experience traumatic events and you can't get any earlier intervention than at a deployed location.\"\n\n\n\nSimonson's primary role here will be providing patient care, including individual therapy and potentially group therapy if he sees an interest for it. Down the road, he envisions the mental health clinic providing alcohol and drug treatment as well. He'll also lead the clinic in its outreach, education and training programs.\n\n\n\n\"We are very excited about the arrival of our new psychologist, as this will be the first-ever full-time mental health services program available to our patients right here at Schriever,\" said 21st MDS Commander Lt. Col. Brent Sonday. \"This is such a great benefit for our active duty and dependent patients to have access to this valuable service in our Schriever clinic.\"\n\n\n\nTo find more about services available at the Schriever Medical Clinic, visit the clinic in Building 220 or call 567-4455.\n\nNEWS INFO Date Taken: 09.12.2013 Date Posted: 09.12.2013 15:16 Story ID: 113542 Location: COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, US Web Views: 126 Downloads: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN This work, 21 MDS welcomes Schriever's first psychologist, by PA Workflow, identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.", "source_domain": "www.dvidshub.net"}

The investigation follows reports of inappropriate interactions between Meta's AI chatbots and children, including flirtatious behavior. The Attorney General's office claims that the AI characters created by Meta and Character.AI are falsely presented as professional therapeutic tools, despite lacking proper medical qualifications or regulation.\n\nMeta has responded by stating that their AI is clearly labeled and includes disclaimers to help users understand its limitations. However, the Attorney General's office has raised concerns about the privacy implications of these interactions, noting that user data is recorded, tracked, and used for targeted advertising and algorithm development. Both Meta and Character.AI have policies that allow for the collection and sharing of user data with third parties, including for advertising purposes.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time when there is growing concern about the impact of AI on children's mental health. The Attorney General's office has highlighted the potential for AI platforms to exploit vulnerable users, particularly children, by presenting themselves as sources of emotional support. The office has also expressed concerns about the lack of regulation and oversight in the AI industry, which could lead to further exploitation and harm.\n\nMeta and Character.AI have both stated that their services are not intended for children under the age of 13. However, both companies have faced criticism for failing to adequately monitor and regulate underage users. Character.AI's CEO has even acknowledged that his 6-year-old daughter uses the platform's chatbots. This has raised questions about the effectiveness of age verification measures and the potential for AI platforms to be used by younger children without parental supervision.\n\nThe investigation is part of a broader effort to protect children from the potential harms of AI and other digital technologies. The Attorney General's office has issued civil investigative demands to both companies, requiring them to provide documents, data, and testimony to determine whether they have violated Texas consumer protection laws. The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for the regulation of AI and other digital technologies, as well as for the protection of children's mental health and privacy.", "source_domain": "www.ainvest.com"}

Proposals then must be vetted by the state’s Title Board, and then proponents must gather some 125,000 voter signatures to make the ballot. For measures amending the constitution, those signatures must include at least 2% of the total voters in each of Colorado’s 35 state senate districts.\n\nKeep in mind these initiatives would be for the 2026 election.\n\nThe initiatives filed by Fields and Taheri were:\n\nInitiatives 14 and 15 would make it a Level 1 drug felony, punishable by up to 32 years in prison, to distribute, manufacture or sell any amount of drug or drug compound that contains fentanyl, carfentanil, benzimidazole opiate or an analog of one of those drugs. Right now, it’s only a Level 1 drug felony if someone distributes, manufactures or sells more than 50 grams of those drugs. Initiative 15 would also make it a Level 4 drug felony to knowingly possess more than 6 milligrams of fentanyl, carfentanil, benzimidazole opiate or an analog of one of those drugs, or a compound containing those drugs. That would be down from 4 grams.\n\nInitiative 16 would amend the state constitution to require voter approval for any fee with projected revenue more than $100 million total in its first five fiscal years, starting in 2027.\n\nInitiatives 17 and 18 would amend the state constitution to require, starting in 2027, that any bills passed by the legislature “with a projected negative impact to the state gross domestic product” of more than $100 million in its first five calendar years to be put to a statewide vote.\n\nInitiative 19 would amend the state constitution to declare that government regulations “restricting or banning common use products and services, such as gas-powered vehicles, stoves, heaters and lawnmowers,” create a severe financial burden. It would block those kinds of bans, based on energy source, from being imposed by state and local governments.\n\nInitiative 20 would reduce Colorado’s individual and corporate income tax rates to 4.35% in 2027 and 4.2% in 2028, down from 4.4%. Initiative 21 would drop the rates to 4.2% starting in 2027.\n\nInitiative 22 would amend the state constitution to declare that families and students have a right to school choice. It’s similar to Amendment 80, which voters rejected in November.\n\nInitiative 23 would declare that “state and local law enforcement must cooperate with federal requests to notify the Department of Homeland Security” before releasing inmates charged with a “crime of violence” as defined in state law or if the inmate has been convicted of a prior felony. It’s targeted at people living in the U.S. illegally as a way to facilitate their deportation.\n\nInitiative 24 would amend the state constitution to require voter approval for any new enterprise with projected fee revenue in excess of $100 million in its first five fiscal years.\n\nWelcome to The Unaffiliated, the politics and policy newsletter from The Colorado Sun.

It’s a playbook he’s used before with success on property taxes.\n\n“We urge the legislature to pass a law mirroring our ballot measure so that Colorado statute mandates cooperation with federal authorities to detain and deport violent criminals and repeat felons who endanger our communities and families,” Fields said in a written statement. “It shouldn’t be optional to take criminals who are here illegally out of our state. It should be mandatory.”\n\nDemocrats in the legislature in recent years have passed laws prohibiting state and local law enforcement in Colorado from assisting federal immigration agents beyond the scope of their criminal investigations. They’re unlikely to budge given the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans.\n\nFields declined to comment further on any of the measures he filed.\n\nThese measures are probably just Fields’ opening salvo. We’re a long way out from 2026.\n\nOTHER BALLOT MEASURES\n\nA few other notable ballot measures have been filed with Legislative Council Staff.\n\nInitiative 25 would repeal the state’s retail delivery fee, which raised funds for transportation projects.\n\nInitiative 13 would end wolf reintroduction in 2026, while Initiative 10 would repeal the 2020 ballot measure to reintroduce wolves. The measures were filed by former El Paso County Commissioner Stan VanderWerf and Spencer Thomas of Garfield County.\n\nand of Garfield County. Initiative 12 would make Colorado a right-to-work state, meaning that all employees at a company couldn’t be forced to pay representation fees, whether they are in a union or not. It was filed by conservative activist Jon Caldara, amid legislative negotiations to change the state’s Labor Peace Act.\n\nTHE NARRATIVE\n\nThe curious case of TABOR’s vanishing people\n\nA vanishing “Welcome to Colorful Colorado” sign. (Photo illustration by Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun)\n\nNearly 24,000 Coloradans are set to disappear from the state’s population this year — at least as far as the state budget is concerned.\n\nIt’s no mere illusion.\n\nThe vanishing act will have real consequences for public services, to the tune of $77 million in required cuts, if lawmakers don’t take action to prevent it.\n\nThe issue dates all the way back to when the legislature first implemented the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights in 1993, the year after voters added it to the state constitution.\n\nObligatory TABOR refresher: The state constitution generally limits state revenue to the combined rate of consumer inflation and population growth. TABOR requires the state to use U.S. Census Bureau estimates to determine the population, but the legislature ultimately decides exactly how the growth rate should be calculated.\n\nFor the past 32 years, the state has used a formula that leads to undercounts in some years and overcounts in others, a Colorado Legislative Council staff analysis found. And it doesn’t necessarily even out.\n\nNext budget year, the formula will result in the state losing 24,000 people to an undercount, trimming the TABOR growth rate by 0.4 percentage points. That has the Joint Budget Committee considering a once-in-a-generation change to how the state calculates the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights revenue cap.\n\nThe current calculation, said Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat and vice chair of the JBC, “isn’t really reflective of reality.”\n\nMath warning: We’re going to walk you through the numbers, so bear with us for a second.\n\nEach December, the Census Bureau releases new estimates for what the population was on July 1 of any given year. So for 2024, Colorado had an estimated population of 5,957,493.\n\nThe 2023 population estimate used in last year’s TABOR cap was 5,877,610. So from one budget year to the next, the population grew by 79,883 people, or 1.4%.\n\nThat’s the rate the JBC wants to use in next year’s budget. But that’s not how population growth is calculated under state law today.\n\nEach December, the Census Bureau tries to correct mistakes from previous years. Under the most recent estimates, the state’s population was actually 5,901,339 in 2023 — about 24,000 more than last year’s estimate. That means that from 2023 to 2024, the state’s population only grew by 56,154 people — a 1% growth rate for TABOR purposes.\n\nOn the surface, that seems like a reasonable way to calculate growth. After all, why wouldn’t you use the most current estimates available?\n\nThe problem is, the state can’t go back and correct this year’s TABOR cap to reflect higher growth. Colorado didn’t get credit for those 24,000 people in this year’s budget, because the cap was set with the smaller estimate from December 2023. And it won’t get credit for them in next year’s budget either, because the state’s population is growing off the new, higher population estimate.\n\n“I actually think the 1% (growth rate under current law) is a better reflection of how much Colorado’s population grew in 2024,” Greg Sobetski, the chief economist for Colorado Legislative Council staff, told the JBC this week. “The issue is that the 1% misses people who ought to have been included in the count of Colorado’s population in 2023. They weren’t, and our current methodology never lets them be counted at all.”\n\nIn other words, unless state law changes, TABOR will make those 24,000 people disappear.\n\nWant to reach Colorado political influencers and support quality local journalism?

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nMICHAEL BENNET\n\nU.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat who isn’t up for reelection until 2028, sent out a fundraising email Wednesday night touting his questioning of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during a confirmation hearing for Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“I pressed RFK Jr. on his long history of spouting conspiracy theories, which is disqualifying for anyone seeking public office, but especially for someone nominated to be the highest health official in America,” Bennet wrote in the email. “If you stand with common sense and against RFK Jr.’s conspiracy theories, please stand with me today. I’m doing everything in my power to make sure he does not become our next Secretary of Health and Human Services.”\n\nCOLORADO GOP\n\nThe Colorado GOP central committee meeting Thursday night was nothing short of a cluster.\n\nChairman Dave Williams called the meeting to vote on a number of party bylaw amendments aimed at making it easier for the party to endorse candidates and opt out of the state’s primary elections, as well as make it harder to remove party officers. The proposals drew a major rebuke from the four Republicans in the state’s congressional delegation, who accused Williams of being “divisive” and attempting to consolidate power.\n\nThe gathering was held virtually over Zoom, and immediately drew a parliamentary challenge.\n\nA central committee member complained that the party’s meeting rules were violated because the government-issued ID’s of participants weren’t checked as required. Williams rejected the challenge, but, on appeal, the central committee narrowly voted to overrule the chairman, at which point he abruptly ended the meeting after an hour and a half.\n\nBefore the meeting ended, Williams clashed with U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert and state Rep. Ron Weinberg. Williams accused his opponents of trying to disrupt the gathering and played down the parliamentary challenge.\n\nELECTION 2026\n\nState Rep.

He is a lead sponsor of the Labor Peace Act bill. (Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun)\n\nGov. Jared Polis has made it clear that Senate Bill 5, the Labor Peace Act measure, is a nonstarter as introduced. But what’s unclear is whether the Colorado labor movement is willing to amend the legislation to get it to a place where Polis may be willing to sign it.\n\nSenate Bill 5 would eliminate a requirement that 75% of workers at a company sign off before a union can negotiate with an employer on union security, which is when workers are forced to pay collective bargaining representation fees regardless of their union participation. Business groups are fighting the change.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat and a lead sponsor of the measure, said “there are some conversations happening” between proponents of the bill, but that “formal offers have not been (made) at this point.”\n\n“I’m optimistic that at least conversations have started happening,” he said.\n\nRogridguez said the governor’s office has not been involved with his discussions with the business community. He said Polis’ representatives told him the two sides should work it out among themselves.\n\n“Where we’ll get to is what both sides are probably going to hate, which is sometimes a good thing,” Rodriguez said. “I don’t know that anything that’s offered will even get the governor (to a point where he could sign it).”\n\nThe governor has said he’s open to reducing the 75% threshold, but Rodriguez said it’s not clear to him that the labor movement would be willing to go there in exchange for dropping the union security vote altogether.\n\nPurplish: The embattled Labor Peace Act\n\n— Colorado Public Radio and The Colorado Sun\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE\n\n🔑 = source has article meter or paywall\n\nThe Colorado Sun is part of The Trust Project.

{"url": "https://bioengineer.org/cu-anschutz-study-finds-smartphone-app-reduces-repeat-suicide-attempts-by-more-than-50-following-hospital-discharge/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "In a groundbreaking advancement for mental health care, researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Yale School of Medicine, and The Ohio State University have unveiled compelling evidence demonstrating the efficacy of a smartphone-delivered digital therapeutic in significantly reducing the rate of repeated suicide attempts among high-risk patients. Published in the esteemed JAMA Network Open on August 8, 2025, this large-scale randomized clinical trial highlights the potential of technology-driven interventions to fill critical gaps in traditional psychiatric care, especially during vulnerable periods post-hospital discharge.\n\nThe study focuses on a phase of psychiatric care often plagued by elevated risk: the weeks immediately following inpatient hospitalization for suicidal ideation or attempts. During this postoperative window, patients commonly experience resurgence of suicidal thoughts, a pattern attributable both to abrupt transitions in care continuity and systemic healthcare limitations. This research sought to determine whether a structured digital intervention could provide timely, personalized therapeutic support when human resources are most strained and patients most isolated.\n\nThe centerpiece of this investigation was OTX-202, a smartphone application developed by Oui Therapeutics, designed to deliver a series of 12 concise, interactive lessons. Each module is engineered to impart cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) techniques, focusing on emotional regulation, safety planning, and crisis management. Patients initiated the intervention during their inpatient stay and continued engagement autonomously post-discharge, complementing standard psychiatric treatment and outpatient follow-up.\n\n.adsslot_X1SkY8j5mK{width:728px !important;height:90px !important;}\n\n@media(max-width:1199px){ .adsslot_X1SkY8j5mK{width:468px !important;height:60px !important;}\n\n}\n\n@media(max-width:767px){ .adsslot_X1SkY8j5mK{width:320px !important;height:50px !important;}\n\n}\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMethodologically, 339 adult patients across six major medical centers—including UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, Yale New Haven Hospital, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, the Menninger Clinic, Western Psychiatric Hospital, and Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services—were enrolled and randomized to receive either OTX-202 or an active control app providing general mental health support absent of targeted therapeutic content. This robust multi-site design enhanced the generalizability of findings and minimized site-specific confounders.\n\nThe trial revealed that among patients with a documented history of suicide attempts, those assigned to OTX-202 demonstrated a remarkable 58.3% reduction in recurrent suicide attempts compared to controls. Furthermore, these patients exhibited sustained alleviation of suicidal ideation extending up to 24 weeks following hospital discharge—a significant temporal improvement over the control group, whose initial gains in mood and cognition deteriorated by the same endpoint. These results underscore the durability of effect and signal the app’s role in stabilizing mental health during critical transitional periods.\n\nCrucially, the digital therapeutic harnesses evidenced-based psychotherapeutic frameworks while capitalizing on mobile technology’s ubiquity. The intervention’s design reflects an appreciation for cognitive load considerations and digital engagement strategies, ensuring users encounter intuitive interfaces, digestible lesson formats, and motivational feedback loops to encourage adherence. This blend of clinical rigor and user-centered design responds directly to adherence challenges endemic to digital mental health tools.\n\nExperts involved in the study emphasize that tools like OTX-202 are not intended to supplant face-to-face psychiatric care but serve as an adjunct during high-risk intervals where in-person support is limited. Dr. Michael Allen, lead co-author and psychiatry professor at CU Anschutz, highlights this paradigm shift, stating, “Digital interventions introduced at critical moments can provide continuous, real-time support tailored to individual needs, enhancing resilience against suicidal crises.” This philosophy aligns with emerging models advocating for stepped and integrated care pathways utilizing digital therapeutics.\n\nThe public health implications of such findings are profound, given that suicide remains among the leading causes of death in the United States, with recorded rates increasing by over 30% since 1999. With more than half a million individuals hospitalized annually following suicide attempts, scalable, accessible interventions that can augment existing treatment frameworks offer a promising avenue to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population.\n\nFrom a neuropsychiatric perspective, the app’s content directly targets dysregulated neural circuits implicated in emotional dyscontrol and impulsivity, which are core contributors to suicidal behavior. By reinforcing cognitive restructuring, distress tolerance skills, and proactive safety planning, the intervention aims to modulate the behavioral phenotypes underpinning suicidality. This mechanistic targeting, coupled with the app’s availability during critical post-discharge phases, represents a significant stride in personalized mental health care.\n\nWhile the research heralds a new frontier in digital mental health, it also acknowledges challenges including user engagement variability, potential for digital fatigue, and issues of equity in access to smartphones and reliable internet connections. Future development will likely focus on adaptive algorithms that personalize content delivery based on user response patterns, integrating biometric data, and expanding accessibility to underserved populations.\n\nIn conclusion, this pioneering clinical trial marks a transformative moment in suicide prevention, illustrating the potent synergy between behavioral science and digital innovation. By extending therapeutic reach beyond physical clinical settings, OTX-202 exemplifies the potential of technology to save lives and reshape mental health paradigms. As the mental health community grapples with escalating demand and resource constraints, interventions like these offer scalable, evidence-based solutions tailor-made for the digital age.\n\nSubject of Research: People\n\nArticle Title: A Digital Therapeutic Intervention for Inpatients With Elevated Suicide Risk\n\nNews Publication Date: August 19, 2025\n\nWeb References:\n\nUniversity of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus: https://www.cuanschutz.edu/\n\nOui Therapeutics: https://ouitherapeutics.com/\n\nJAMA Network Open article: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837367\n\nKeywords: Psychiatry, Behavioral psychology\n\nTags: cognitive behavioral therapy via appdialectical behavior therapy smartphone applicationdigital therapeutics for mental healthimpactful mental health research findingsinnovative therapies for psychiatric caremental health interventions for high-risk patientspsychiatric care post-hospital dischargerandomized clinical trial on suicide preventionreducing repeat suicide attemptssmartphone app for suicide preventiontechnology in mental health treatmenttransition care for suicidal patients", "source_domain": "bioengineer.org"}

Technology that alerts physicians of an overdose history. Immediate and affordable access to overdose-reversing medication. Resources that support early intervention.\n\nThese types of tools may seem illusory. But the Texas Medical Association’s Committee on Behavioral Health has a clear vision of these and other solutions needed to empower physicians to combat the opioid crisis without compromising their ability to provide the best care possible to all their patients.\n\n“The more time a physician has to spend translating data into clinically actionable information ... the less time they have to connect with their patients and deliver better patient care,” said Michael Sprintz, DO, a pain and addiction specialist in Spring and member of the committee.\n\n“We have a massive population of people that are under-identified and under-treated for a lot of behavioral health issues that increase the probability of developing a substance use problem and or overdose,” he said. At the same time, “when we talk about protecting our patients, it’s not just protecting our patients in identifying a substance use disorder in someone. It’s protecting our patients who don’t have a substance use disorder,” so they can still access needed medications.\n\nTexas continues to take steps to address the opioid problem, with TMA weighing in most recently on potential interim study items by the Texas House Public Health Committee. TMA also helped win reinstatement of state funding to make electronic health record (EHR) integration with the state’s prescription monitoring program (PMP) free for all medical professionals, and the passage of a law requiring certain school campuses to have opioid antagonists on hand.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott named the fentanyl crisis an emergency item in early 2023. Later in the year, Texas’ Opioid Abatement Fund Council (OAFC) – formed to manage money recovered from statewide opioid lawsuit settlements – announced the first of its responses to the crisis: prevent overdoses with distribution of naloxone, promote drug prevention education in schools and communities, and strengthen the behavioral health workforce.\n\nBut state plans still lack what physicians have long called for: more complete and accessible data that can guide clinical decisions and, equally important, early intervention.\n\n“Being able to have these sorts of conversations that then begin to address the use disorders in families becomes so important,” said Leslie Secrest, MD, a Dallas psychiatrist and co-chair of the Committee on Behavioral Health. “That is the area that we’d like to see something begin to change, and processes change, that allow [substance use disorder] to be identified and worked with early on, [as well as] figure out ways to facilitate prevention of those events.”\n\nThe data gap\n\nWhile physicians may not see immediate change, the work and attention on opioids is part of an overall positive trend.\n\nTMA continues to monitor OAFC’s recently proposed rules to guide the distribution of an estimated $166.7 million in opioid settlement funds to more than 150 hospital districts over an estimated 18 years, as directed by state law.\n\nPerhaps acknowledging the data gap, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently gave states, including Texas, a grant aimed at least in part at improving data collection and analysis and expanding and modernizing data systems.\n\nAbout $1.6 million of the five-year Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) grant from CDC will go toward expanding and modernizing data systems. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) will lead the charge on the health information improvements; the Texas Health and Human Services Commission will use the remaining $2.3 million of the grant to implement solutions based on DSHS’ findings.\n\nThe OD2A state program provides support for clinician education and training, as well as for health information technology infrastructure improvements, including enhancements to state prescription drug monitoring programs.\n\nIn Texas, that means the PMP, which, along with emergency medical services (EMS) data collection, falls short, says Dr. Sprintz.\n\nTMA has long advocated for usability and access improvements to the PMP. The Committee on Behavioral Health would like to see the integration of more helpful enhancements that paint a more complete picture of a patient’s history, for example, by creating an alert when a given patient has a history of overdose and integrating better EMS data that may otherwise not make it to an EHR.\n\nPhysicians “need to be able to look at the information and instantly grasp it in a visually usable way that enables them to go, ‘Oh, OK, I see what’s going on,’” Dr. Sprintz said.\n\nHe is clear that having the PMP “is absolutely better than not having it.” Throughout much of its tumultuous implementation, however, the overwhelming amount and inaccessibility of PMP data have rendered it not clinically useful.\n\n“The data is not yet in an easily actionable format that physicians or providers without much experience are able to use optimally,” he said.\n\nThe PMP presents a patient’s prescription history, along with a “risk score” based on the number of prescriptions, prescribers, and overlap. But Dr. Sprintz says that score is dubious at best, and physicians don’t always have the time or resources to sort through patients’ history.\n\nNor are physicians informed on “the actual algorithm that calculates that risk score. ... It’s never been peer reviewed, yet clinicians sometimes make life-changing clinical decisions based on those risk scores,” he said.\n\nIt does not account for a host of different factors that impact a patient’s risk of a substance use disorder, let alone the risk of an overdose, Dr. Sprintz adds. Additionally, looking at prescription histories from neighboring states requires further legwork by the physician within the PMP. Both factors can obscure the true risk of prescribing to a patient.\n\nBetter collection of EMS data also can bridge gaps. In addition to collecting EMS data on overdose-related home visits and emergency department trips, the Committee on Behavioral Health suggests having emergency medical technicians carry additional naloxone to dispense on site, along with educational materials on low- or no-cost treatment options for substance use disorder.\n\nTexas does track overall numbers for opioid-related deaths or disabling events, Dr. Secrest says. But these data leave out a large swath of patients who may overdose and then still be vulnerable to repeat events, or patients at risk of overdose who could be reached with early intervention.\n\n“A person will talk about how [a loved one] overdosed and was given naloxone, and it got them enough time for EMS to get there,” Dr. Secrest said. “Well, where’s the metric? If you talk to the ER docs, [it’s unclear] how much more they’re seeing people come in or not come in by EMS because of an opioid overdose.”\n\nMoreover, patients experiencing an overdose or otherwise struggling with substance use disorder often don’t feel safe going to a hospital or seeing a physician, Dr. Sprintz says.\n\nAlong with a general mistrust of the health care system, “there’s a lot of fear. We [physicians] know we’re not calling the cops on [patients]. They don’t.”\n\nEarly interventions\n\nGovernor Abbott’s emergency declaration also paved the way for greater distribution of naloxone, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March approved the first over-the-counter naloxone nasal spray; the second followed in July.\n\nDr. Sprintz, who serves on the FDA Advisory Committee that made the approval, calls it “fantastic” and “a huge step in the right direction” but recognizes its limitations.\n\n“I don’t want us to create the illusion that just handing out naloxone is going to prevent or decrease the rate of opioid use disorder, the incidence of opioid use disorder, or the prevalence in our communities. We need to do more,” he said.\n\nThat includes making antagonists like naloxone more affordable and accessible, whether to individual patients, their communities, or private treatment centers.\n\nAt press time, a two-pack of naloxone nasal spray retailed at a pharmacy for about $45 without insurance coverage.\n\n“It’s not inexpensive,” Dr. Secrest said. “How do you get it widely available in all communities in all economic settings? That’s where our opportunity is: beginning to try to have conversations of how to get this in a form that is widely available and readily obtainable.”\n\nTMA’s letter to the Texas House Public Health Committee offered suggestions for supporting private treatment funding and improving payment for screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment processes. These suggestions could be reformulated as budget requests or catch the eyes of medicine’s allies in the legislature for future bills.\n\n“Being able to provide resources to private community groups to help distribute naloxone and educate their community is the smartest thing we could possibly do,” Dr. Sprintz said. “Bring it back to the community in which the people live.”", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org"}
{"url": "https://filtermag.org/colorado-refelonizing-fentanyl-no-good/", "title": "", "published_at": null, "full_text": "Increasing criminal penalties for fentanyl had zero impact on overdose deaths in Colorado and accomplished nothing good. That’s the result of a study commissioned by the state itself to research outcomes of a law that refelonized fentanyl possession charges.\n\nIn 2022, Colorado lawmakers took a step that they claimed would help reduce overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The legislature and Governor Jared Polis (D) signed off on a bill to create harsher criminal penalties. Possession of 1-4 grams of any substance containing fentanyl would now be charged as a Level 4 felony, when it was previously a misdemeanor. Anyone convicted would also be mandated to undergo a substance use disorder assessment, and possibly court-ordered treatment.\n\nThe bill did also include harm reduction measures, such as $19.7 million in funding for distribution of naloxone and fentanyl test strips, and increased mental health services. Another $3 million in funding went towards expanding opioid treatment in correctional facilities. However, the criminal penalties took effect in July 2022—a year before any money was distributed for these services.\n\n“I was not surprised by the fact that overdose did not decrease, and stayed the same or increased for certain populations.”\n\nThe state required a study assessing the efficacy of this new law, and commissioned a team including researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Kaiser Permanente Colorado Institute for Health Research. Their research, published in January, looked at changes from 2018-2024 and found no correlation between increased felony charges and reduced overdose deaths.\n\n“I was not surprised by the fact that overdose did not decrease, and stayed the same or increased for certain populations,” one it its co-authors, Cole Jurecka, MPH, a senior research services professional at Colorado School of Medicine, told Filter.\n\nOther benefits the law’s proponents had anticipated did not materialize either. The researchers looked into whether the law made people more likely to seek medications for opioid use disorder like buprenorphine, or more likely to stay on such medications.\n\n“The most surprising finding for me,” Jurecka said, “was that retention on certain medications for opioid use disorder did not increase—in fact, [it] decreased for methadone—given the fact there were some small provisions in the law that would in theory help people access these drugs more easily. That was not the case.”\n\nBeginning in 2018, there was an overall increase in people starting buprenorphine treatment in Colorado, but that trend wasn’t affected by the new law, the researchers found. Regarding methadone treatment, there was no change in initiation—but a decrease in people continuing treatment after the law took effect.\n\nFelonization’s lack of impact on overdose deaths was in line with Jurecka’s expectations, he said, due to prior scientific literature which “tells me that increasing criminal penalties does not improve health outcomes.”\n\n“There was money spent on expanding services, but it’s hard to disentangle from the criminal penalties. Pairing these together is a catalyst of fear for people who would need access.”\n\nReflecting on the overall outcomes of the Colorado research, Jurecka noted that the felony penalties and increased treatment funding are policies that are at odds with each other.\n\n“There are two things at play,” he said. “There was money spent on expanding these services, but it’s hard to disentangle from the criminal penalties. Pairing these together is a catalyst of fear for people who would need to access these services. Imagine someone who needs these medications, but is afraid of punishment. That’s why I don’t think there was any real change.”\n\nHowever, the authors were unable to demonstrate that the decrease in people continuing methadone treatment after the law took effect was caused by the law itself. “Caution is urged in interpreting these results as the methadone data does not include observations of all patients receiving methadone treatment and reporting standards changed for methadone clinics during the study period,” they wrote.\n\nThere was no significant change in overdose rates associated with the law over the time period studied, although there was a major spike during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers found that non-Hispanic Black residents had higher overdose rates in four of the 16 months following the law’s passage, compared with the equivalent prior period. But again, they stated that they couldn’t conclude this was because of the law.\n\nLooking at the law’s criminal-legal impact, the researchers found that totals of opioid possession-related convictions actually stayed consistent between 2020-2024, even in the severity of charges increased. The demographics most subjected to these convictions were, in order, Black, Hispanic and white residents. The authors did not find data on how many people were diverted from prison or jail to court-mandated treatment.\n\n“Community members across the spectrum of experiences, including law enforcement professionals, perceived fentanyl possession criminal penalties to be misguided.”\n\nAnd in speaking with 31 policymakers, peer support specialists, police and health care providers, the researchers found that these stakeholders were not happy with how the goals of reducing overdose and expanding treatment were being pursued.\n\n“The qualitative analyses suggest that community members across the spectrum of experiences, including law enforcement professionals, perceived fentanyl possession criminal penalties to be misguided,” they wrote, “and that expanding services including medications, other treatment services, and diversion options would be more likely to reduce overdose rates.”\n\n“Participants largely discussed [the bill as having] been driven by emotional responses rather than empirical evidence,” they continued. “While the policy was initially aimed at penalizing those distributing fentanyl, which participants largely agreed this policy should focus on, in practice, the policy continued to target people who use drugs and people engaging in subsistence level drug distribution.”\n\nSome years prior, Colorado lawmakers had taken a different approach to drug use. In 2019, they approved a measure to reduce penalties for possession of many substances (up to 4 grams) to a misdemeanor. That included fentanyl as well as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Sales and distribution charges remained felonies.\n\nBut politicians soon began to attack this limited reform. Lawmakers initially advanced the current law after a tragedy in which five people died of apparent fentanyl-involved overdose at an apartment complex in Commerce City. Numerous politicians, including Governor Polis, endorsed repealing the 2019 defelonization for fentanyl. The resulting refelonization law was a compromise of sorts—some Republicans wanted to go much further by imposing 250year mandatory minimum sentences and classifying fentanyl as a “weapon of mass destruction.”\n\nHarm reduction advocates blasted the repeal effort. “They keep wanting to incarcerate folks and that has never worked,” Lisa Raville, executive director of the Harm Reduction Action Center in Denver, told Filter at the time. “All that has done is drive use underground. We are in a public health emergency that demands a public health approach.”\n\nMonths after the law took effect, Kevin Franciotti reported for Filter on consequences which included police treating drug users more aggressively, community organizations fearful that distributing fentanyl test strips could implicate people, and individuals scared to call 911 in case of an overdose.\n\nJurecka noted that Colorado saw a small decrease in overdose deaths in 2024, according to CDC data, yet groups including Black and Indigenous residents continue to face increasing overdose rates. He urged lawmakers to embrace a public health approach.\n\n“Expanding access to treatment works,” Jurecka said. “We have so much evidence that confirms the efficacy of medications for opioid use disorder—but it must be disentangled from increasing criminal penalties. Our 50-year history with the War on Drugs [shows] these do not improve health outcomes.”\n\nImage of Colorado State University police by Alex Smith used via Flickr/public domain.", "source_domain": "filtermag.org"}

Sydney, who is deaf and suffers from cerebral palsy and seizures, uses a feeding tube and a wheelchair. With a surgery scheduled for the following week, Laura, 42, says she knew the photos would have to happen on that rainy Sunday on July 15.\n\n“We needed to get the pictures done before the surgery,” Laura tells PEOPLE. “I was very nervous that we’d have to cancel. [I was] pretty upset since I knew we were running out of time. It was pouring, pouring rain.”\n\nJessica Vallia Photography\n\nWith the rain pouring, Laura, Sydney and Vallia sat in the car wondering what they’d do. Suddenly, Laura and Vallia, 37, decided to go to a nearby Starbucks with hopes that staff would let them take photos of Sydney in the coffee shop. There they met 20-year-old Christian Lopez who agreed to the photo shoot. But the supervisor took his kindness a step further, lending his umbrella and helping the women unload their car.\n\n“It was incredible. He was almost like our knight in shining armor. I couldn’t believe how nice this kid was,” Laura says. “He had gotten Sydney a towel, they dried her off. And he was making all of us hot chocolate! He made it with soy milk because he was worried someone might have allergies.”\n\nJessica Vallia Photography\n\nThere were about three customers at the Starbucks in Fountain, and about three employees, Vallia says. And everyone joined in to help, making colorful signs for Sydney and even providing a curtain to use as a backdrop.\n\n“Sydney was so happy with all of the attention. She loves people. She was looking forward and smiling and giggling the entire time,” Vallia tells PEOPLE of the shoot. “It could not have turned out more perfect.”\n\nJessica Vallia Photography\n\nPhotos from the shoot showed Sydney smiling wide in a Dirty Dancing t-shirt, a tutu and sneakers. Vallia says she couldn’t help but share the photos — and the sweet story — on Facebook. The post has been shared more than 6,000 times.\n\n“There were serious tears from all after taking in everything from yesterday’s senior session,” Vallia wrote in the post. “I just wanted her to have the average senior session, like any other girl and instead she got THE RED CARPET in a way I couldn’t have been more proud to be a part of!!!”\n\nJessica Vallia Photography\n\nAs for Sydney, Laura says the high schooler has loved the attention from the viral photos.\n\n“I showed her herself on the news … she recognized herself.

The growth, coupled with Be Well Texas’ telehealth capacity, will ensure the availability of opioid use disorder treatment services in all of the state’s rural counties.\n\nBriseida “Bee” Courtois, MSW, LCDC\n\n“Deaths from opioid-related overdose are one of the greatest health failures of our time, and partially attributable to unfairly distributed treatment resources,” said Briseida “Bee” Courtois, MSW, LCDC, Be Well Texas provider network program manager and director of this grant project. “These types of need disparities led UT Health San Antonio to launch the Be Well Texas network.”\n\nA rural disparity\n\nThat disparity appears to be more pronounced in rural than in urban areas. More opioid prescriptions are dispensed to Texas’ rural residents per capita than to urban residents, which likely has become a source of supply for illegal drug markets and a contributor to increasing overdose rates.\n\nFor example, while opioid pills were distributed at a rate of 29.4 per person living in Bexar County each year from 2006 through 2014, the rate was 88.3 in Young County in North Texas, according to a Washington Post analysis of a database maintained by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nOther rural counties had similarly high rates compared to larger counties: Childress (76.2), Wilbarger (75.2), Brown (68.1), Palo Pinto (66.9).\n\nBexar County’s number was comparable to other urban areas: Harris (35.6), Dallas (28.6), Travis (26.0), El Paso (16.3).\n\nOpioid death rates in Texas might be higher than thought since the majority of the state’s rural counties do not report opioid-related mortality. This, coupled with the fact that state data systems do not distinguish between urban and rural overdose deaths, makes it difficult to quantify the number of opioid-related deaths in Texas’ rural counties.\n\nThe new rural consortium will be a subset of the existing statewide Be Well Texas program, currently serving more than 10,000 adults annually and consisting of 76 contracted Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) and/or Office-Based Opioid Treatment (OBOT) providers delivering substance use treatment – for opioid use, alcohol use, stimulant use and other substance use disorders – as well as non-severe mental health treatment and peer recovery supports. Commonly used substances include prescription and synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and heroin.\n\nAligning with HRSA goals\n\nThe consortium’s objective aligns with the goals of HRSA’s Rural Communities Opioid Response Program-Behavioral Health Care Support: to build capacity to deliver low-barrier, digital and/or in-person OUD treatment and recovery support services according to participant needs and preferences.\n\nKey strategies are:\n\nOUD treatment, telehealth – Rural residents with the capacity for and interest in digital communications will receive telehealth care from Be Well Texas, including medication management, individual and family counseling, medication-assisted treatment, case management and peer recovery supports. Medication will be delivered through the mail or administered at a local pharmacy, and compliance will be monitored and support services provided according to a pre-determined schedule of digital contacts.\n\nOUD treatment, in-person – Rural residents without internet access or those preferring more traditional in-person care will be able to obtain MAT and counseling from 28 rural providers scattered across the state. Since Texas’ rural residents often work outside of their home county, they can also receive services from the network’s 59 additional MAT and OBOT centers in small towns and urban centers.\n\nRecovery Support Services – This evidence-based practice includes support and assistance from a person with lived experience of a substance use disorder, as well as wrap-around services. The rural consortium will have access to Be Well Texas’ network of 11 RSS programs (expanding to 18 by the end of 2022), either in-person or digitally, offering a minimum of two recovery support peer specialists or recovery coaches and/or reentry peer specialists per case.", "source_domain": "news.uthscsa.edu"}

Medications such as buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone often are used to treat opioid dependence and help patients achieve recovery, while naloxone is used to quickly reverse instances of opioid overdose.\n\nDetails and Objectives\n\nWestfall explained to AAFP News that the HOMER trial originated from a prior study, “Implementing Technology and Medication-Assisted Treatment and Team Training in Rural Colorado,” which was aimed at increasing the use of MAT for OUD among rural practices in the state.\n\n“We heard from many patients, physicians and practices questions about what is the best way to start a patient on treatment,” said Westfall. “The start of treatment for OUD is called induction and, while there are several evidence-based methods, there has not been a comparative effectiveness trial to determine the best method. Even more important may be identifying which patient is most likely to benefit from which induction method.”\n\nPractices selected for participation in the HOMER trial will be asked to identify six to 20 patients who have opioid dependence or OUD and who have opted to receive MAT with buprenorphine.\n\nIdentified patients will then be randomized to receive MAT in one of three methods:\n\noffice-based induction, during which patients discontinue opioid use, begin withdrawal and receive the first few doses of buprenorphine in the clinic setting, with additional monitoring from clinic staff and the prescribing physician;\n\nhome induction, in which patients can stop opioids at any time and start buprenorphine when they reach the appropriate level of withdrawal; or\n\ntelehealth induction, in which the patient undergoes the same process as an office-based induction, but from a location other than the clinic, with contact between patients, clinic staff and the prescribing physician by phone or video.\n\nInduction, Westfall said, “is a crucial first step to long-term treatment. One must successfully complete MAT induction to move on to MAT stabilization and, ultimately, MAT maintenance.”\n\nWestfall said that research to determine the best method of MAT induction is lacking, as is research that indicates which patients would derive the most benefit from each method.\n\nAs such, the HOMER study’s aims are to\n\ncompare short-term stabilization and long-term maintenance treatment engagement in MAT among patients who receive home-based, office-based or telehealth induction; and\n\nidentify which clinically relevant practice and patient characteristics are associated with successful long-term treatment.\n\nPractices selected for participation will undergo training beginning in March 2021. During the trial, participating practices will have access to a variety of MAT resources, including treatment forms, protocols and guidelines.\n\nPatient enrollment will occur for 12 months beginning in April 2021. Patients who participate in the trial will be monitored and their data tracked for nine months. During this time they will be asked to complete a series of surveys related to quality of life, self-reported opioid use and other measures. Clinic staff and prescribing physicians may also be asked to complete surveys or participate in interviews.\n\nOverall, the trial will run for three years and is expected to enroll 1,200 to 1,400 patients to allow for attrition.\n\nHow You Can Participate\n\nOne hundred primary care practices throughout the United States are expected to be involved in the trial. Although the recruitment period runs through February 2021, FPs who want to participate are highly encouraged to submit a study interest form at their earliest convenience.\n\nWestfall explained how FPs individually, and the specialty in general, could benefit from taking part in the study.\n\n“Family doctors are on the front lines of the opioid epidemic,” Westfall said. “We see lots of patients with opioid use disorder, and many want to get help. Too often, the big universities do these studies on a very narrow spectrum of patients and just expect family doctors to use that evidence, but evidence created at the academic medical center may not actually be the best evidence for a primary care practice.”", "source_domain": "www.aafp.org"}

These definitions determine the services that qualify for reimbursement under Medicaid and private insurance.8\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) encourages states to \"use the flexibility built into Medicaid to create innovative payment methodologies for services that incorporate telemedicine technology.\"9 Here are examples of how some states handle payment:\n\n48 states and the District of Columbia provide some level of Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine. 10\n\n39 states have some form of Medicaid coverage and reimbursement for telemental health services. 1112\n\nOn the private payer side, 32 states and the District of Columbia have private payer policies in place for telehealth.

The unique nature of telemedicine services could allow doctors and mental health providers to easily provide services across state lines. However, many states' licensure requirements limit this possibility.\n\nThese licensure laws cover physicians as well as psychologists, social workers, nurses, and pharmacists. 17Some evidence suggests that adding licensing requirements for professionals who practice across state lines may slow or limit the expansion of telemedicine technologies by some healthcare facilities.16\n\nTo deal with this emerging issue, states have established several options for licensing telemedicine practitioners:\n\nEight states accept conditional or telemedicine licenses from out-of-state physicians.\n\nThree states have established registries that permit qualifying out-of-state physicians to practice in the states.\n\n18 states have adopted the Federation of State Medical Boards' compact. This \"enforces an expedited license for out-of-state practice\" for doctors, including psychiatrists. 18\n\nSimilar multistate agreements that would include other mental health professionals, such as psychologists, are in the early stages of development. 14\n\nEvidence of effectiveness\n\nEvidence suggests that telemental health services can be effective for underserved populations, such as rural Americans.19 Telemental health can also:\n\nEffectively treat underserved children with specific conditions, such as ADHD. 20\n\nMeet the broader behavioral health needs of children and adolescents.\n\nSuccessfully meet the psychiatric needs of rural children. 21\n\nAlthough these studies demonstrate effectiveness for these specific populations, more evidence is needed to support the use of telemental health for the broader population of rural children with MBDDs. In rural areas, adoption of new interventions and methods often outpaces research into the potential effectiveness of expanding those programs.22\n\nMore rigorous research into these innovative approaches can expand the evidence base and may increase adoption of telemedicine services and interventions for treating rural children with MBDDs.\n\nChallenges\n\nPrivacy. Providers must ensure that patient privacy and confidentiality are maintained at the same level as with an in-person visit. 23\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) created \"national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information (PHI).\"24 Telemental health providers handling PHI must follow the same HIPAA requirements as for in-person meetings. 25\n\nCost. The cost of telemedicine technology may limit adoption. These costs include:26", "source_domain": "www.cdc.gov"}

The scientific community widely recognizes that most dementia cases, including Alzheimer’s disease, are related to a combination of vascular and neurodegenerative lesions.\n\nAnd cerebral small-vessel disease is thought to be the main underlying contribution to cognitive decline and dementia, with nearly half of dementia cases showing both Alzheimer’s and cerebral small-vessel disease neuropathologic characteristics, the study notes.\n\nStill, while observational studies had shown evidence of an association between white matter hyperintensity burden and increased risk of stroke and dementia, causal evidence had been limited. White matter hyperintensities are lesions in the brain that show up as areas of increased brightness in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nIn the new study, researchers were able to provide evidence of a causal link between vascular traits and Alzheimer’s disease, using genetic instrument variable analyses known as Mendelian randomization – a method that leverages the natural randomization of genetic alleles to test how differences in the genetic effect on modifiable exposure influence disease risk.\n\nSpecifically, in a two-year analysis ending July 24, 2022, and using Alzheimer’s disease genome-wide association studies of up to 75,000 European dementia cases, they found causal evidence of an association of larger WMH burden with increased risk of the disease, accounting for pulse-pressure effects.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of combining several complementary epidemiological approaches and data types, and of accounting for caveats of instrumental variable analyses when exploring the impact of vascular traits on late-onset diseases like dementia.\n\n“As vascular disease is a treatable contributor to dementia risk, our findings have broad significance for prevention strategies of Alzheimer’s and dementia as a whole,” Sargurupremraj concluded.\n\nThe researchers advise future studies to examine whether their findings can be generalized to non-European populations.\n\nOther institutions and entities represented in the study include the University of Bordeaux (France); University of Washington; University of Michigan; University of Tartu (Estonia); Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam (Netherlands); Boston University and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Framingham Heart Study; Icelandic Heart Association (Iceland); Washington University, St. Louis; University of Oxford (United Kingdom); Department of Public Health, Bordeaux (France); University of Pittsburgh; University of Lille (France); Radboud University, Nijmegen (Netherlands); Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago (Chile); University of Iceland (Iceland); Oslo University Hospital, Oslo (Norway); Norwegian University of Science and Technology; Imperial College London (United Kingdom); National Institute on Aging; and Bordeaux University Hospital (France).\n\nUT Health San Antonio is a primary driver of San Antonio’s leading $44.1 billion health care and biosciences sector, and is the largest academic research institution in South Texas with an annual research portfolio of $413 million.\n\nGenetic Complexities of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Blood Pressure, and Dementia\n\nMuralidharan Sargurupremraj, Aicha Soumaré, Joshua C.

Greg Abbott in February listed the fentanyl crisis as one of seven “emergency” items this session, clearing a path toward passage of Texas Medical Association-backed legislation that aims to curb opioid-related deaths.\n\nIllicitly produced fentanyl causes most opioid overdoses in the U.S., including in Texas. In 2018, Texas saw 210 deaths associated with fentanyl, but that rose to 1,612 by 2021, according to the Department of State Health Services. In 2021, fentanyl was tied to 95% of all unintentional synthetic opioid deaths in the state, the agency says.\n\nTMA is tracking several measures that could help improve the state’s crisis response by legalizing fentanyl test strips, increasing the state’s supply of the opioid antidote naloxone, and easing physician use of Texas’ prescription monitoring program (PMP). (See “Opioid Bill Watch,” right.)\n\nGovernor Abbott signaled his support for these bills during his Feb. 16 State of the State address, saying Texas must “increase the supply of lifesaving Narcan” – a brand name for naloxone – “so we can save more Texans who are ambushed by fentanyl.”\n\nThe bills could be fast-tracked given Governor Abbott’s declaration of the fentanyl crisis as an emergency item this session.\n\nMeanwhile, developments at the federal level also are paving the way toward solutions by increasing access to opioid disorder treatments and overdose-reversing drugs.\n\nIn addition, Texas’ preliminary budget bills from both the House and the Senate include funding for licensing fees related to the PMP, which physicians are required by state law to consult when prescribing certain opioids and other controlled substances.\n\nPhysicians don’t have to pay to access the PMP, but they do have to pay fees to keep their electronic health record integrated with the program. Michelle Romero, TMA associate vice president of public affairs, says the $7 million budget item could help remove what has amounted to an “unfunded mandate” for physicians over the past few years.\n\nTestifying on TMA’s behalf, Mesquite pain management specialist C.M. Schade, MD, endorsed these interventions, along with other TMA recommendations, during a Sept. 13 interim meeting of the House Committee on Public Health. He is a member of TMA’s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health.\n\n“The ‘opioid crisis’ is no longer just about prescription opioids,” he testified, emphasizing that the main driver is illegally manufactured fentanyl. “It is time for us to reexamine our processes and change course.”\n\nTMA’s other recommendations include:\n\nInvesting in effective data mining software to compare pharmacy purchases with pharmacy PMP sales to spot illegal prescribing and dispensing;\n\nImproving education and prevention programs about opioids;\n\nExpanding mental health and substance use disorder services;\n\nImproving data collection to identify at-risk populations; and\n\nCreating community-based syringe service programs, which can connect people with addiction to the larger health care system for treatment and other services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal progress\n\nRecent federal efforts also could give states a boost in the fight.\n\nThe U.S. government recently ended a major restriction on prescribing buprenorphine, one of the most effective medications for treating opioid use disorder.\n\nPassage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 swept away the need for an “X waiver” for physicians or other health care professionals to be able to prescribe buprenorphine, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nSince 2000, physicians have been required to obtain an X waiver under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. Among other things, the waiver required physicians to take an eight-hour training program before being able to prescribe buprenorphine. Other health care professionals had to take 24 hours of training.\n\n“On top of that, it gave the DEA authority to visit physician practices unannounced to specifically audit buprenorphine prescribing,” said Carlos Tirado, MD, an Austin addiction psychiatrist and member of TMA’s Subcommittee on Behavioral Health. “It created an adversarial environment in which physicians experiencing these DEA on-site practice audits often felt that they were being treated like criminals for treating a chronic medical condition.”\n\nA 2021 rule change by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services allowed physicians to opt out of the eight-hour training – though they still had to obtain the waiver and face audits. Also, those who opted out could treat only 30 patients with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act eliminates X waivers entirely, including special audits or restrictions on the number of patients, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\n“All practitioners who have a current DEA registration that includes Schedule III authority, may now prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder in their practice if permitted by applicable state law and SAMHSA encourages them to do so,” the agency said.\n\nComplex cases of opioid addiction – like those with underlying problems with mental health or infectious disease – will still require input from addiction specialists, Dr. Tirado says. But eliminating the X waiver will make it easier for primary care physicians to initiate care or maintain care for patients who are stable on the medication.\n\n“Restricting buprenorphine during the worst opioid crisis of our lifetimes probably contributed to making the opioid epidemic worse,” he said.\n\nSimilarly, as of press time in early March, two panels of medical experts had unanimously recommended to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that Narcan nasal spray, which can reverse an opioid overdose, be made available over the counter – a move Texas physicians have long championed. A final FDA decision was still pending.\n\nThe goal of the FDA panels’ recommendation is to make the naloxone spray cheaper and more widely available so that more people can prevent opioid overdoses, Dr. Schade says.\n\nAn opioid overdose slows respiration until a person stops breathing, he says.\n\n“After that, you have about five minutes before you’re brain dead,” Dr. Schade said. “What that means is that you have to have [Narcan] rapidly available.”\n\nPharmacies in most states – including Texas – are allowed to use a standing order from a physician to provide the medication to anyone who wants to buy it. But people still must pay whatever copay their insurance requires, and that can drive up the price, he adds.\n\nMaking Narcan available over the counter should lower the cost for consumers and make the medication as common as other over-the-counter medications.\n\n“If it’s over the counter, the price will go down, and people will have it,” he said. “Through education, it will be widely available in first-aid kits and be omnipresent.”\n\nNarcan nasal spray poses no safety risk for the public, even for children, adds Dr. Tirado.\n\n“Naloxone is incredibly safe,” he said. “In fact, it’s one of the safest medications out there. There’s really no reason this shouldn’t be over the counter.”\n\nThe recommendation for Narcan’s over-the-counter use came from a joint meeting of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee. The unanimous vote by the committees’ 19 members was nonbinding, but FDA typically follows recommendations by its expert medical panels.", "source_domain": "www.texmed.org"}

Its integration into 988 marks a shift toward centralized crisis response.\n\n“By consolidating Colorado Crisis Services into the national 988 framework, Coloradans have one easy-to-remember number for immediate help,” said Gordon Coombes, director of 988 Colorado. “Trained specialists are available 24/7, 365 days a year.”\n\nThe 988 services in Colorado are operated by Solari Crisis and Human Services, a nonprofit specializing in behavioral health crisis response.
